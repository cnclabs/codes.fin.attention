the products are platform independent and operate on all major workstation platforms both unix and nt operating systems and allow access to visualizations with personal computers  thereby allowing customers to use visproducts with their existing hardware and software 
when deployed on an enterprise wide basis  the company s visproducts enable the creation of a collaborative visual environment that allows functional groups throughout the organization  including engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and support  to more easily visualize products  see the effects of changes during the development process and communicate in real time 
this collaborative approach can help reduce the total time required for products to move from initial concept through final manufacturing by identifying problems early in the design cycle 
in november  the company acquired two companies rosetta technologies  inc which produced a line of software products used for viewing and accessing of product design data  and cimtech inc  which produced a line of software products used for factory design and layout 
the acquisition of these companies increased the number of products in the company s product line and added management  development and sales employees 
the company has historically evaluated acquisition opportunitites  is currently evaluating several companies of varying size and anticipates that acquisition opportunities will continue to be identified and evaluated in the future 
no understandings or agreements with respect to any acquisition currently under review have been reached and there can be no assurance that the company will  or will not  consummate acquisitions in the future 
the company s interactive products apply advanced d technology to multimedia programs developed for clients targeting the consumer and educational markets 
in addition to titles published on cd rom  the company also produces customized interactive programs for specific educational and training situations  including museums  libraries  hospitals and universities 
the company s interactive products also combine proprietary animation technology with d rich content to address the communication needs of clients in the biomedical  multimedia  entertainment  litigation and corporate communications markets

the company expects that near term interactive product revenues will consist primarily of development fees  as well as royalties from sales of certain of its interactive software titles 
the company has experienced some seasonality in sales of software products related to budget cycles of its customers which has been reflected in higher sales in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
consumer purchases of interactive products may experience some effects of seasonality created by the christmas holiday 
in addition  the company s sales of interactive products in the academic markets may experience some effect of seasonality created by the academic school year 
the company has scheduled product introductions in due to the inherent uncertainties of software development  the company cannot accurately predict the exact timing of new product shipments  nor can the company be assured that any significant revenues will be derived from these product offerings 
any delays in the scheduled release of these products  or any failure to achieve market acceptance of such products among new or existing customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results

since its inception  tcv has had no other significant activities other than its investment in rosetta 
in connection with this transaction  tcv expensed approximately  of acquired in process research and development and recorded approximately  of goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
income taxes in thousands expense   effective tax rate the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and  differs substantially from the statutory tax rate due to nondeductible acquisition related costs 
the company s income loss before income taxes and minority interest for and includes expenses for acquired in process research and development and acquisition charges of million and million respectively  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
the company also recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance that had been previously established to offset a portion of its deferred tax assets

in  the company used cash of million in its investing activities  of which  was used to purchase property and equipment   was used for the development of software and  was paid as an advance to the developer of the company s new office building 
accounts receivable at december  increased million to million from million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased revenues 
the company s accounts receivable balance will vary from year to year  depending on revenues  contract terms  and timing of collections 
the company had a million line of credit agreement with a commercial bank  which expired on may  and was secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
borrowings under the credit agreement were limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement

the company used a portion of the net proceeds of its follow on offering to repay a  note payable 
the company believes its cash and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by the company will not be required nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as required by the company 
safe harbor for forward looking statements the company or its representatives may  from time to time  make or may have made certain forward looking statements  orally or in writing  including  without limitations  any such statements made or to be made in management s discussions and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations contained in its various sec filings 
the company wishes to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements  so as to ensure to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the reader that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
the company operates in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
management cannot predict such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factors  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
variability of operating results the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
the company s revenues are affected by a number of factors  including the timing of the introduction of new software products and interactive products by the company and its competitors  seasonality of certain customer purchases  product mix  general economic conditions and the company s ability to obtain agreements from publishers and distributors to market the company s products 
the company s operating results also will vary significantly depending on changes in pricing  changes in customer budgets and changes in the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
therefore  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
technological change and market acceptance the company s success depends on its ability to develop and sell new products  develop site licensing agreements with major manufacturers in the automotive  aerospace  heavy equipment and other manufacturing industries  develop its d and d software products for new platforms and continue to produce high quality interactive products in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  the company must continually anticipate  and adapt its products to merging computer technologies and capabilities  such as enhanced graphics  sound  music  video and speech generation 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate because the markets that the company targets are in the early stages of development and because of uncertainties arising from the effect of future product enhancements  future developments in hardware and software technology and future competition 
if the company s products become outdated and lose market share or if new products or existing product upgrades are not introduced when demanded by the market or are not accepted by the market  the company s revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products on a timely basis or that such new products will be accepted in the market 
impact of acquisitions in november  the company acquired rosetta and cimtech and will continue to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities in the future 
any acquisition  however  involves inherent uncertainties  such as the effect on the acquired business of integration into a larger organization and the availability of management resources to oversee the operations of the acquired business 
the company s ability to integrate the operations of the acquired companies is important to its future success 
there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to integrate new businesses nor as to its success in managing the larger operations resulting therefrom 
even though an acquired business may have experienced profitability and growth as an independent company prior to its acquisition by the company  there can be no assurance that such profitability and growth will continue thereafter 
dependence on emerging market for software products and customer concentration the market for enterprise wide visualization software products in the automotive  aerospace  heavy equipment and other manufacturing industries is emerging and dependent on a number of variables  including customer preferences and the rate of adoption of new technology 
there can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow or that the company s software products will be accepted by the market 
the company s growth is dependent in part on significant demand for its software products 
in addition  as the company increasingly markets it d and d visualization software as an enterprise wide solutions  there can be no assurance that large customers will be willing to invest in the company s products on a company wide basis or that users outside the design and engineering areas will accept the company s products 
in  sales of software products to one customer accounted for of the company s revenues 
see item business marketing and distribution 
there can be no assurance that eai will be able to continue to sell software products to this customer at levels or  if it fails to do so  that the company will be able to replace this customer with new customers 
dependence on emerging market for interactive products the market for interactive multimedia software products is emerging and dependent on a number of variables  including consumer preferences  shipments of multimedia personal computers  the installed base of multimedia personal computers and the number of other publishers creating interactive software products 
there can be no assurance that this market will continue to grow 
the market for games and educational multimedia software is characterized by rapid changes in computer hardware and software technology and is highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation 
the company s near term growth is dependent in part on significant demand for its recently released interactive products and for its products under development 
however  the company does not typically receive royalty revenues from a product until the publisher achieves a minimum level of sales of the product  which may not occur immediately after delivery of the product to the publisher  if at all 
there can be no assurance that the company s new interactive products will be accepted by the market or that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of the market 
reliance on third parties to market and distribute certain interactive products the company s strategy has been to rely upon third parties to market and distribute its interactive products 
eai does not have an exclusive relationship with any of the current distributors of its interactive products 
the company s relationships with publishers have involved contracts that address a single product or title for a specific market area and do not constitute a continuing marketing and distribution agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company s relationships with publishers will continue or that the company will be able to find other means to market and distribute its interactive products 
failure to continue such relationships  establish new relationships or develop independent means of marketing and distributing interactive products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results 
reliance on third parties to market and distribute certain software products in addition to marketing the company s software products directly to end users  the company has contractual relationships with hewlett packard to jointly market and structural dynamics research corporation sdrc to jointly market and distribute certain of the company s software products 
although these contracts represent a significant marketing and distribution opportunity for the company s software products  there can be no assurance that these contractual relationships will be successful in creating significant sales or that these relationships will be continued beyond their contract terms 
management of growth and international expansion the company has experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth which could place a significant strain on the company s employees  operating procedures  financial resources and information systems 
the company plans to introduce a significant number of new products  increase its production capacity and development expenditures  expand its sales and marketing initiatives and hire additional employees 
such activities will require significant managerial expertise 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  the company s revenues  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in connection with the company s plans to increase its sales and marketing presence in europe and asia  the company will be incurring expenses in advance of revenues 
if the company is unsuccessful in generating sufficient revenues to recover their expenses or is unable to hire  train and retain experienced international sales and marketing personnel  the company s revenues  operating results and financial conditions could be adversely affected 
increased international activity could expose the company to foreign currency fluctuations  foreign labor laws and other unforeseen problems 
competition the company expects significant competition in each of its two product lines software products large computer companies or companies competing in the cad cae cam and pdm markets could offer products with the same or similar functionality as offered by the company 
such companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company  include autodesk inc  dassault systemes sa  division plc  ibm  parametric technology corp  sdrc  and silicon graphics  inc although the company believes it has a technological advantage over potential competitors in these markets  maintaining its advantage will require continuing investment by the company in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that such investments will be successful 
interactive products the interactive software publishing industry is intensely competitive 
the company s sales to the educational and consumer markets may be adversely affected by the increasing number of competitive products 
the company s interactive products will compete directly against other educational and consumer software products including multi player internet games 
the company s competitors in this area include a large number of companies  some of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  such as broderbund software inc  cendant corporation  digital domain inc  gt interactive software corp  and softkey international inc moreover  large corporations  such as microsoft corporation and the walt disney company  which have substantial bases of intellectual property content and substantial financial resources  have entered or announced their intention to enter the market for consumer software 
while the company believes that most special effects firms target the feature film and advertising markets  these firms could refocus their efforts in the commercial markets  an area in which the company derives a portion of its interactive product revenue 
these special effects firms  some of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company  include dreamworks skg  industrial light and magic a division of lucasfilm limited  and pixar 
in addition  a large number of small companies provide custom animations to commercial markets as a complement to their primary business of studio film production  engineering consulting and communications consulting 
year computer conversion the company has developed and implemented a plan to upgrade its information technology in order to prepare for the year and has completed conversion of all critical data processing systems 
all of the company s systems and applications are compliant 
the company has also initiated communications with its significant vendors to determine the extent to which the company s systems may be vulnerable to third parties failure to remediate their own issues 
management currently does not anticipate such a failure to be an issue 
however  operating results could be impacted if the systems of other companies with whom the company transacts business are not compliant in a timely manner 
protection of proprietary rights the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its extensive proprietary technology and databases 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non competition agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent the company s competitors from obtaining or using the company s proprietary technology and databases 
certain of the company s products include mechanisms intended to prevent or inhibit unauthorized copying 
in addition  the company packages its software products with license agreements  which prohibit unauthorized copying of such products 
unauthorized copying does  however  occur in the software industry  and if a significant amount of unauthorized copying of the company s products were to occur  the company s revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are or may be distributed do not protect the company s products and proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
furthermore  as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  software developers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products  or that any such assertion will not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
competition for such employees is intense and the process of locating key technical and management personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute the company s strategy can be lengthy 
accordingly  the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the company maintains key person insurance covering certain of its executive officers 
however  the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to offset the company s loss of the services of any of its executive officers 
risk of liability claims by customers although the company has not experienced product liability claims by customers  the company could experience such claims in the future 
the company s interactive software products carry a disclaimer that the products should not be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes and are only for educational and medical reference purposes 
the company has general liability insurance and insurance for errors and omissions in the content of its products 
if a liability claim were to be made  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in defending against the claim or  if unsuccessful  that the amount of insurance coverage  if any  would be sufficient to pay the claim 
share price volatility the trading price of the common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
anti takeover provisions the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a non negotiated merger or other business combination involving the company 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with the transaction 
certain of these provisions may  however  discourage a future acquisition of the company not approved by the board of directors in which stockholders might receive an attractive value for their shares or that a substantial number or even a majority of the company s stockholders might believe to be in their best interest 
as a result  stockholders who desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
such provisions could also discourage bids for the shares of common stock at a premium  as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of common stock 
in addition to the common stock  the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
the company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
however  because the rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion  the company may issue preferred stock that has rights and preferences superior to the rights of holders of shares of the common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of shares of the common stock 
in addition  the board of directors has adopted a stockholders rights plan that may have an anti takeover effect and may discourage or prevent takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors including takeovers that certain stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
dividends the company has not paid any dividends and does not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever pay a cash dividend
