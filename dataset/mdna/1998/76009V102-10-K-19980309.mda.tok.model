the company has also substantially increased its presence in the mro supply business  which has historically had lower gross margins than the company s equipment rental business 
the company has historically financed its acquisitions  start up locations and capital expenditures primarily through the issuance of equity securities  secured bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow 
such financings have increased the company s interest expense and resulted in the accretion of dividends on its redeemable preferred stock prior to its redemption in september because all of the acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  such acquisitions have increased the company s goodwill and other intangibles including covenants not to compete 
during the initial phase of an acquisition or start up location  the company typically incurs expenses related to completing acquisitions and opening start up locations  training employees  installing or converting information systems  facility set up and marketing expenses 
as a result  the profitability of a new location is generally expected to be lower in the initial period of its operation than in subsequent periods 
integration of acquisitions is generally completed within the first six months  while the company generally expects start up locations to achieve normalized profitability after one year 
the company anticipates that as it continues to implement its growth strategy  new locations will continue to impact the company s margins until such locations achieve normalized profitability

acquisition transactions are typically subject to numerous conditions  including due diligence investigation  environmental review and negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement 
in evaluating acquisition targets  the company considers  among other things  the target s competitive market position  management team  growth position and the demographic characteristics of the target market 
at any time  the company may have one or more offers outstanding and may have executed one or more letters of intent or binding acquisition agreements 
as of february   the company is party to letters of intent to acquire an additional six equipment rental businesses with a total of locations in eight states for an aggregate purchase price of million including up to  shares of common stock

since december   the company has completed six acquisitions of rental equipment businesses including valley with an aggregate of locations and has opened two new start up locations  bringing the company s total number of locations to as of february  during the year ended december   the company completed acquisitions of rental equipment businesses with a combined total of locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash including the payoff of assumed debt   shares of common stock of which  shares will be issued in future years and the assumption of approximately million in liabilities

general 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the company s growth strategy and by the need to offer customers a modern and well maintained rental equipment fleet 
to pursue its growth strategy  the company must be able to complete acquisitions  open start up locations and make the capital expenditures necessary to acquire and maintain its rental fleet 
at february   the company was obligated  under noncancellable purchase commitments  to purchase approximately million of equipment 
such purchases are expected to be financed with cash flows from operations and through borrowings under the revolver 
the company believes cash flow from operations  together with availability under the revolver  and vendor financing in appropriate cases  will be sufficient to support its current operations for at least the next months 
however  to complete certain pending acquisitions  to make certain discretionary capital expenditures and if additional acquisition opportunities arise  the company will need to seek additional capital 
such acquisitions and capital expenditures could be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including convertible debt  or the issuance of common or preferred stock which may be issued to third parties or to sellers of acquired businesses  depending on market conditions 
if such financing were not available  the company s growth strategy could be hampered and its cash flow from operations reduced  thereby constraining funds available for growth and acquisitions 
further  additional indebtedness would increase rsc s leverage and may make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit its ability to withstand competitive pressures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings or additional capital  if and when required  will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
environmental the company and its operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  worker safety  air emissions  water discharge and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
under such laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in  or emanating from  such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
the company incurs ongoing expenses associated with the removal of older underground storage tanks and other activities to come into compliance with environmental laws  and the performance of appropriate remediation at certain locations 
the company has accrued  at december  related to the removal of underground tanks and remediation expenses 
the company believes the impact of the cost of such remediation on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material

for financial reporting purposes a valuation allowance of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to those carryforwards 
these separate company net operating loss carryforwards are subject to restrictions in accordance with internal revenue service code section  and the ultimate utilization of the net operating losses is further limited based on the future profitability of certain subsidiaries of rhi 
the company also has alternative minimum tax credit carryovers of approximately million for federal and  for state of california income tax purposes which are available to offset future regular income tax that is in excess of the alternative minimum tax in such year 
approximately  of the federal and all of the state alternative minimum tax credit carryovers resulted from the company s acquisition of rhi 
for financial reporting purposes a valuation allowance of approximately  has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to all alternative minimum tax credit carryovers 
limitations similar to those restricting the use of the net operating losses also restrict the use of the credit carryovers 
any tax benefit resulting from the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or the tax credit carryovers obtained in the acquisition of rhi will be accounted for as a reduction of the purchase price in the periods they are realized 
inflation and general economic conditions although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on its results of operations 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected by events or conditions in a particular region  such as regional economic  weather and other factors 
in addition  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments by the company under its variable rate credit facilities 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer and software systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation could be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to 
the issue is whether systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause complete system failures 
the company has received confirmation from all of its current systems vendors that each of their systems will properly handle the rollover to the year although there can be no assurance  management believes the year problem will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
