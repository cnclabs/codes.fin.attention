pos services overview the company s pos services revenues are derived primarily from the transmission through its network of transaction information between merchant or service provider pos terminals and transaction processing computer centers 
the company s pos services customers  primarily third party transaction processors  are typically charged a set price per transaction and an additional excess seconds charge for transactions which utilize the company s network facilities greater than a specified period of time 
pos services revenue also includes other revenues composed primarily of fixed monthly fees charged to customers for the use of digital transmission circuits 
these circuits connect their processing facilities to the company s network 
the vast majority of pos services revenue is derived from customers involved in the electronic processing of pos credit card transactions 
to a lesser extent  the company derives pos service revenue from the electronic processing of other types of transactions such as healthcare insurance eligibility verification  electronic transfer of government benefits such as food stamps and aid to families with dependent children electronic benefits transfer or ebt  point of sale transactions using debit cards  automated teller machine atm transactions and other smaller pos markets 
the company s transaction volume and revenue growth to date has resulted primarily from increasing the company s transaction volumes from existing customers and from attracting new customers to the tns network 
to a lesser extent  the company has benefited from the growth in electronic transaction processing markets 
this growth has resulted primarily from an increase in the number of credit and debit card transactions processed electronically 
the company believes that the use of electronic transaction processing in markets other than the credit card market  including transactions for the healthcare industry and atm and ebt transactions  will also contribute to future overall market growth 
during  six of the ten largest third party pos credit card transaction processors were customers of the company 
these six customers comprised approximately of the company s pos services revenue and of its total revenue 
the ability of the company to attract the remaining four of the current ten largest pos credit card transaction processors is dependent primarily upon those customers contractual commitments with their current network provider s 
consequently  while the company will continue to pursue the remaining large third party processors as well as smaller processors  it expects that the predominant source of growth within pos services will come from increasing its transaction volume from existing credit card processing customers and growth from new pos transaction markets 
as a result  the pos services revenue growth rate may not continue at historical levels 
average revenue per pos transaction decreased to in from in and from in this resulted in a decline in average revenue per pos transaction of comparing to and comparing to the reduction is primarily related to a decision made by the company in to re negotiate its contracts with most of its largest customers in exchange for contract extensions 
the pricing of these new contracts is significantly lower than the pricing these customers received prior to these re negotiations and the majority of these customers benefited from the re negotiated contracts during the remaining contracts became effective on january  as a result  the full effect of the contract re negotiations was fully reflected in the average revenue per pos transaction during the first quarter of the decline in pos revenue per transaction has stabilized in and revenue per pos transaction was relatively constant for all of the company s revenue per transaction varies between a transaction  an transaction and other types of transactions eg atm  ebt 
the revenue per transaction for a transaction is generally less than that for an transaction and the revenue per transaction for an ebt or atm transaction and other types of transactions are generally greater than pos and ebt transactions 
the company is anticipating an increase in the relative percentage of transactions and to a lesser extent a relative increase in other types of transactions  and as a result  the revenue per transaction may increase 
however  future average revenue per pos transaction amounts will depend primarily on the relative contribution to total transaction volume from each of the company s sources of pos transactions and competitive pressures 
telecom services overview tns s june acquisition of fti added a second significant service offering telecom services to the company s business 
telecommunications services revenue is derived primarily from providing fraud control and billing validation services to telecommunications carriers 
revenues from these activities are derived primarily from a per query fee charged to the company s customers for each processed fraud control and billing validation query 
telecommunications services revenue also includes fixed monthly fees charged to customers for the use of transmission circuits  network equipment or access ports on the company s computer and communications facilities 
customers for the company s current telecommunications services primarily include long distance telephone carriers  operator services providers  information services providers and private pay telephone companies 
management believes it has substantially obtained the current available transaction volume from existing customers 
as a result  revenue growth will be dependent on the ability to add new customers  transaction growth from existing customers through their intrinsic growth and acquisitions  overall market growth  and the ability to develop new services 
certain of the company s telecommunications services customers have long term contracts while others have extended beyond their contract term or do not have long term contracts 
many of the company s telecommunications services customers are small and have limited resources 
accordingly  revenues from these customers are subject to a higher degree of credit risk than is the case for the company s pos services customers 
management believes the company is adequately reserved for the credit risk associated with this customer base 
tsd has grown through the addition of new customers  through the company s acquisition of contract rights and other intangible assets  through customers of the company s services acquiring customers who used another service provider  and through the provision of new service offerings 
many of the company s core customers in the fraud control and billing validation services market have not achieved growth rates comparable with those experienced by many of the company s pos customers  and in some cases have experienced erosion in call and query volumes and revenues 
the reduction in call and query volumes is directly related to so called dial around  cellular  and pre paid calling card services which route telephone calls made from pay phones  hotel phones  or other public use telephones to long distance carriers other than those chosen by the telephone proprietor 
these dial around offerings effectively divert telephone calls away from the company s traditional customer base for fraud control and billing validation services primarily operator services providers and pay telephone providers to other telecommunications companies with proprietary billing validation databases in many cases mci and at t 
as part of the telecommunications act of the act  the federal communications commission fcc was authorized to mandate a payment scheme pursuant to which pay telephone operators are fairly compensated for all access code calls  debit card calls  subscriber and other toll free calls which originate on the pay phone service providers facilities but which are routed to telecommunications carriers other than those pre subscribed by the telephone proprietor dial around compensation 
in october  the fcc established a rate of per call as the default per call compensation rate for subscriber and access code calls made from payphones during the next two years 
after the first two years of per call compensation  a payphone s market based local coin rate  as adjusted for certain costs  will become the default rate 
while it is uncertain what impact the new rules will have on dial around usage and therefore on demand for traditional tns telecom services offerings  many industry observers believe that the use of dial around services will continue to grow at the expense of the traditional pay telephone long distance services upon which the company s customer base for fraud control and billing validation services relies 
recently  several local exchange carriers lecs have furthered this trend by introducing proprietary calling cards which utilize dial around access 
the company has developed a dial around compensation service offering dac for both the payphone owners and carriers 
while there can be no assurance of the company s success in new marketing efforts  the company believes that this new service will take advantage of the continuing trend toward the use of dial around services and may provide some offset to the impact of dial around on the company s telecommunications services 
financial services overview in march  the company announced the building of a new network the financial services network and a new product line the tns fastlink registered trademark data service offered by its financial services division 
this new line of services offers a secure private extranet for executing securities trading orders electronically between brokerage firms and financial institutions 
the tns fastlink registered trademark data service routes fix protocol messaging over a secure tcp ip network an ip backbone network 
fix is an open communication messaging protocol that enables a high speed electronic exchange of trading information in a common language between brokerages  institutions  and securities markets 
the fix protocol facilitates the electronic communication of indications of interest  orders  and execution reports which are normally exchanged by telephone between traders or proprietary systems 
the financial services network was engineered and developed by the company 
tns fastlink registered trademark data service revenue consists of a one time installation fee and fixed monthly recurring revenues thereafter based on the number of network connections 
the fastlink registered trademark data service offering required the company to build and support the financial services network 
through december  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million in network equipment to build the financial services network 
these costs were primarily for network equipment located at the company s reston headquarters  various tns points of presence pops located around the country  and at customer sites 
the company seeks to leverage the cost associated with the financial services network through additional service offerings 
international services overview the company currently has significant international activities in the united kingdom uk  canada  ireland  and sweden and recognized  of international revenue in in the uk and canada  the company has entered into technology transfer arrangements whereby tns sells pos equipment and software to its international customers 
the equipment sales are generally one time sales  but the company also has agreements entitling it to receive recurring revenues in the form of royalties  software license fees and maintenance fees 
royalties are based on the pos revenues generated by its international customers resulting from the use of the company s pos technology 
the company began to record royalty revenue under these arrangements in the company intends to seek growth in its international operations through partnering and joint venture arrangements with existing companies and the establishment of its own subsidiaries 
in  the company formed tnsl as its european technology and marketing center 
tnsl has a dual mission 
in addition to building and operating a pos network for the irish market  tnsl provides technical support for the company s international customers and operations 
tnsl is in a start up phase and has not generated significant revenue to date 
in october  the company acquired a majority interest in pronoma systems ab through tnsl 
this company has been renamed transaction network services tns ab tnsab and operates as a tns subsidiary located in stockholm  sweden 
currently  all tnsl and tnsab losses are being absorbed and consolidated with the company s operating results 
tnsl and tnsab s losses consolidated with the company s operating results were approximately  for and  for network cost overview the majority of the company s operating expenses relate to the costs of its family of network offerings 
the largest component of expense  cost of network services  is composed primarily of five elements usage costs charged by local exchange carriers for local access to the tns network and by inter exchange carriers for their service  per transaction costs charged by local exchange carriers and others for access to information from line information databases lidbs  recurring costs for salaries and expenses related to the personnel responsible for managing  operating and servicing the network and computer facilities  recurring monthly charges including charges for digital transmission circuits for network access and backbone capacity  site co location fees or site leases and other network expenses  and recurring charges related to the company s computer facilities  and network expansion charges which include charges related to the activation of new customer numbers across the network and installation charges for incremental digital transmission capacity  new sites and other elements of network expansion 
network expansion charges are expensed by the company when incurred 
pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act  the fcc instituted a rulemaking proceeding in december referred to as access charge reform access reform that seeks to reform the current system of interstate access charges and make it compatible with the competitive paradigm established by the act 
the initial phase of access reform was implemented in july the initial phase of access reform resulted in a decrease in certain components of the company s variable cost per transaction and as a result  lowered its network costs 
the second phase of access reform took place in january the second phase of access reform resulted in an additional decrease in certain components of the company s variable cost per transaction  however  the second phase increased certain fixed monthly recurring charges and instituted certain new fixed monthly recurring charges 
as a result  the company may experience an increase in its network costs at least until the next phase of access reform is instituted in july the company believes that future revisions to its costs under access reform may reduce its network costs since the company believes that it is not subject to certain of the new charges instituted by access reform and that  in any event  the increased charges are not in accordance with the spirit of access reform which is intended to reduce overall access charges 
however  there can be no assurance that the future phases of access reform will result in reductions to the company s network costs and  in fact  they may increase 
the ultimate impact of access reform is dependent upon  among other things the ability to increase transaction volumes  which benefits the company when lower variable costs are instituted  the nature and amount of fixed charges which are primarily based upon the number of connections in the company s network  which increases network costs  future actions by the fcc  the ability of the company to modify its network design to react to pricing revisions  and the ability of the company to successfully defend and receive credits for improperly billed charges 
accordingly  the impact of access reform on the company s future network access costs is unknown  and the company cannot predict the timing  outcome or effects of the fcc s deliberations or of any future tariff matters 
during  the company plans to implement it s own on network access service and to continue to expand its ss capabilities 
the installation costs of service are significantly more expensive compared to installation costs 
however  the company s own on network service will reduce the recurring cost of providing access service and provide the company greater control of the service while reducing the company s reliance upon third party service providers 
the per minute charges from third party service providers are significantly greater than those expected to be incurred by the company s own access service 
additionally  management believes that the company s own on network access service reduces a barrier to entry in obtaining additional transaction volumes from the company s existing customers and from new customers by facilitating the customer s conversion from another service provider to the company 
generally  when a pos terminal is reprogrammed it requires physical changes to be made at the terminal location 
an terminal  once the company s own on network service is available  may be switched to the tns service utilizing portability at virtually no cost to the customer 
the company considers the availability of its own on network access service necessary to continue to increase transaction volumes on its network 
the costs of establishing an on network access service will negatively impact gross margins until the installation costs are offset by an increase in transaction volumes 
after a certain transaction volume level  the company believes that gross margins will increase due to a significantly lower variable cost per transaction from the company s own on network access service versus the variable cost charged by third party service providers 
the ultimate impact on gross margins will primarily depend upon the timing of the roll out of the company s own on network access service  competitive pricing pressures and transaction volumes 
the company s own on network access service also is expected to provide the company with an opportunity to be more competitive on pricing new business due to the lower variable cost per transaction 
the company has recently significantly expanded its backbone and access network capacity in order to ensure adequate capacity and an appropriate network architecture for expected increases in network traffic from current and new markets 
in addition  in  the company made capital expenditures of over million in network equipment in connection with the tns financial services network and the implementation of its own on network access service 
the company expects to make further capital expenditures in these areas in these additions to the tns family of network offerings will require both non recurring installation costs and recurring network costs which will increase the cost of network services in the new services offered by the telecom services division including lnp  leconnect sm  and dac will also result in additional network costs 
the company believes that the gross margin percentage on new service offerings may be greater than those on traditional tsd and pos services 
the impact on and future gross margins will be largely dependent upon the company s ability to successfully market these additional services 
in  the company also expects to continue to monitor and expand its backbone and access network capacity as required to handle traffic growth from existing customers and new services 
depending on the demand for some of the pos and telecommunications services expected to be offered by the company during  significant additional network costs may be required 
in addition  the company is continuing its effort to establish certain of its own site facilities rather than co locating with other telecommunications companies in order to obtain greater control and flexibility with its digital backbone network 
all of these activities will increase the cost of network services 
results of operations the following table sets forth the applicable percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of network services gross profit other operating expenses engineering development selling  general administrative depreciation amortization of intangibles total other operating expenses income from operations interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to revenues total revenues increased by to  from  in pos services revenue increased by to  from  in the growth in pos services revenue resulted primarily from an increase in transaction volume and associated revenue from the company s existing pos customers 
pos transaction volume increased by to billion from billion in the company s five largest pos customers represented of total pos revenues in and of total pos revenues in as the company increases its market share  its historical rate of pos services revenue growth is not likely to continue 
the transaction volume growth rate exceeded the revenue growth rate primarily because the average revenue per transaction declined approximately from in to in during  the company re negotiated contracts with most of its largest customers 
these contracts now call for a single flat rate basic price structure with increasing volume commitments during the life of the contract  rather than volume discounts which became effective only after certain volume thresholds were met 
in exchange for extending the term of these contracts  the customers received significant price reductions 
the majority of these customers benefited from the re negotiated contracts during  however  the remaining contracts took effect on january  accordingly  the full effect of the contract re negotiations was reflected in the average revenue per pos transaction during the first quarter of the decline in pos revenue per transaction stabilized in and revenue per pos transaction was relatively constant for all of the company s revenue per transaction varies between a transaction  an transaction and other types of transactions eg atm  ebt 
the revenue per transaction for a transaction is generally less than that for an transaction and the revenue per transaction for an atm transaction and other types of transactions are generally greater than both pos and ebt transactions 
the company is anticipating an increase in the percentage of transactions and a significant increase in other types of transactions  and as a result  the revenue per transaction may increase 
future average revenue per pos transaction will depend on the relative contribution to total transaction volume from each of the company s sources of pos transactions and increasing competition to obtain new business 
telecommunications services revenue increased by to  in from  in the growth in revenue was primarily due to growth in queries processed for the company s existing telecommunications customers as well as the successful introduction of new services 
the company began offering its fastlink registered trademark data service in through its financial services division 
financial services revenue was  in international revenue was  in and  for the significant decline in international revenue was due to approximately  of equipment sales in which did not reoccur in recurring international revenue revenue excluding equipment sales was approximately  in and  in cost of network services cost of network services increased by to  in from  for this growth resulted primarily from increases in usage charges and charges for billing validation information resulting from increased transaction and query volumes 
gross profit gross profit represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues reflects the fact that the reduction in average revenue per pos transaction over the periods was not fully offset by local access rate reductions and network efficiencies 
future gross profit margins depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  total transaction and query volume growth  the impact of access reform  the relative growth and contribution to total transaction volume of each of the company s customers and types of services  the timing and extent of the company s network expansion including its own on network access and financial services network  the ability of the company to successfully resolve improperly billed charges primarily from the lecs and the gross margins on new service offerings 
in addition  any significant loss or significant reduction in the growth of transaction volume could lead to a decline in gross margin because a significant portion of network costs are fixed costs 
as a result  maintaining historical gross margin levels depends in part on growth in transaction volume generating economies of scale and on the ultimate impact of access reform 
engineering and development engineering and development expense increased by to  in from  in as a result of the growth of the company 
engineering and development expense is composed of the salaries  personnel expenses and other expenses related to the company s network equipment systems integration  software development and technology assessment activities 
the company has not capitalized any costs associated with software or other development performed by its engineering and development groups 
future engineering and development costs may increase due to additional resource requirements associated with the introduction of new services 
the company does not anticipate incurring material costs associated with its computer systems to accommodate the year issue

amortization of intangibles the amortization of intangible assets was increased by to  in from  in amortization of all existing intangible assets is expected to be approximately  per quarter over the next several years 
income taxes the effective tax rate increased to in from in the increase is primarily a result of the losses related to the company s activities in ireland 
the company has not recorded a tax asset for these losses due to tnsl s brief operating history 
if tnsl becomes profitable  tnsl may cause a reduction in the effective tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate in ireland than in the united states 
net income and earnings per share net income increased by to  in from  in diluted earnings per share grew to in from in the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share increased to  during from  in shares outstanding increased primarily because of an increase in common stock equivalents used in the company s calculation of common equivalent shares under the treasury stock method 
this effect was partially offset by the company s purchase of  shares of its common stock during the second quarter of basic earnings per share was for and in basic earnings per share was greater than diluted earnings per share by for and due to the dilutive impact of stock options

telecom services revenue growth also increased from the inclusion of the revenues derived from the june  asset purchase from intellicall  inc and  to a much lesser extent  from the purchase of intangible assets including an exclusive services agreement from amnex  inc in march these contract rights generated approximately million of revenue in international revenue  a new source of revenue for tns in  was  for of which approximately  related to equipment sales 
the company has entered into technology transfer agreements whereby the company provides pos equipment and software to its international customers 
tnsl s losses were approximately  for cost of network services cost of network services increased by to  from  during this growth resulted primarily from increases in local access  usage charges and charges for billing validation information resulting from increased transaction and query volume 
growth in cost of network services also resulted from costs associated with increases in network capacity purchased from outside vendors and from increases in other costs associated with operating the company s network 
gross profit gross profit increased by to  from  during this represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues reflects the fact that the reduction in average revenue per pos transaction over the periods was not completely offset by local access rate reductions and network efficiencies 
the company is also continuously engaged in the review and dispute of improperly billed charges from its largest vendors  the lecs 
the amount of billing disputes resolved in the company s favor during was larger than had been experienced in prior periods 
engineering and development engineering and development expense increased by to  from  during the growth in these costs is due to the growth of the company 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to  in from  in the increase in these expenses is attributable to several factors 
additional expenses were incurred as a result of an increase in administrative staff and expenses associated with the growth of the company 
in march  the company relocated to a new headquarters facility and began incurring lease expense on the new building 
total lease costs and building expenses related to the new headquarters facility were approximately  for the full year of compared to approximately  in selling  general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the formation of tnsl 
depreciation depreciation expense increased by to  in from  in depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of capital equipment for network expansion to support growth in the company s business 
amortization of intangibles the amortization of intangible assets increased by to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from two factors 
first  the amortization of approximately  of intangible assets acquired from intellicall on june  was recognized for the entire period of versus six months of second  on march   the company completed an asset purchase from amnex of amnex s proprietary fraud control system and related databases and entered into long term marketing and service agreements with amnex 
the company paid approximately  in cash for these intangible assets resulting in increased amortization 
income taxes provision for income taxes was  for compared to  for the effective tax rate in the year ending december  was approximately 
in  the effective tax rate has increased to approximately as a result of the company s activities in ireland 
the company has not recorded a tax asset for these losses due to tnsl s brief operating history 
net income and earnings per share net income increased by to  from  during earnings per diluted share grew to for from for the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share increased to  for from  for shares outstanding increased primarily because  shares of common stock issued by the company in august of were outstanding for all of basic earnings per share was for and in basic earnings per share was greater than diluted earnings per share by for and due to the dilutive impact of stock options 
quarterly results the following table presents certain unaudited operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two year period ended december  this information has been prepared by the company on the same basis as the audited financial statements and includes all adjustments necessary to present this information fairly when considered in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

the volume of such transactions on the company s network is expected to be weakest in the first quarter  stronger in the second quarter  greater still in the third quarter high travel season and peak in the fourth quarter holiday season 
the company adds network capacity and associated recurring monthly costs during the year in order to handle expected fourth quarter peak volumes 
as a result of these seasonal patterns  revenues  earnings and gross profit margins from pos credit card transactions in the first quarter  when revenues are lower and network utilization is lower  are expected to be lower relative to the fourth quarter of the immediately preceding year  when revenues and network utilization are high 
to date  the strong underlying growth of the company s pos business has alleviated this seasonal effect to some extent  but the company expects that its operating results in the foreseeable future will be affected by seasonal trends 
the company s revenues from calling card transactions from its tsd customers tend to be greatest during the second and third quarters  although this revenue composes a smaller percentage of total revenues than does pos services revenue 
variability also occurs in operating expenses due to the timing of network expansion 
the company is expecting to incur significant non recurring network expansion costs as well as a significant increase in certain recurring network costs during the first and second quarters of a significant portion of these costs are associated with the company s roll out of its own on network access service  circuits required for increases in transaction volumes from pos and telecom customers and from the implementation of its fastlink registered trademark data service 
the company may experience a reduction in gross margin in certain quarters depending on the timing of these costs 
network expansion charges are expensed by the company at the time such costs are incurred 
as a result of all these factors  significant variability in quarterly earnings may occur and is expected
