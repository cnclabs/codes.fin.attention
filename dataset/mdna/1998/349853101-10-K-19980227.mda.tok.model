liquidity and capital resources the continued growth of the company s business  and the nature of its operations  have required significant investment in new equipment 
the company has historically financed revenue equipment purchases with cash flows from operations  through borrowing under credit agreements with financial institutions and from proceeds of the initial public offering in november working capital needs have generally been met with cash flows from operations and borrowing under the company s line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investment activities was approximately  and million in  and  respectively 
investing activities consisted primarily of the acquisition of additional revenue equipment and enhanced management information systems during  and  the acquisition of a business in and the acquisition of a terminal facility in net cash provided by used in financing activities was approximately  and million in  and  respectively 
these financing activities included the company s continued financing of additional revenue equipment  based upon capital expenditure requirements  coupled with repayment of long term debt and capital leases with cash generated from operations 
the company expects net capital expenditures in for revenue equipment and management information systems  excluding acquisitions  to be less than million 
the company expects to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information concerning credit arrangements 
at december   the company had a line of credit with a bank in the amount of million  which expires in may at december   approximately million was available for borrowing under the credit line 
at december   the company also had equipment loan agreements which permit the company to borrow up to million for the purchase of revenue equipment 
at december   approximately million was available for borrowing under the equipment loan agreements 
management believes that available borrowings under the line of credit agreement  equipment loan agreements  future borrowings under installment notes for revenue equipment  and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through at least impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs and systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has been in the process of replacing the majority of its key financial and operational systems as a part of upgrading its legacy systems in the normal course of business 
this replacement has been a planned approach for the last two years to enhance or better meet its functional business and operational requirements 
management believes that this program will substantially meet or address its year issues 
in addition to its replacement program  the company will require modifying some of its software and hardware so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the estimated cost of the remaining replacement and modification for the year issue is not considered material to the company s earnings or financial position 
the company also plans to initiate a formal communication process with all its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s system 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and hardware and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company
