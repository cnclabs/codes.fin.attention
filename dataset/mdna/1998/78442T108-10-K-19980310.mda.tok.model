the company s strategy is to improve upon and utilize the selling  general and administrative infrastructure of the prior acquisitions as a base for further sales growth 
interest expense  net  decreased from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reduction of outstanding debt in june  with a portion of the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering and cash flow from operations 
this reduction in debt was offset by new debt incurred to finance certain acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources the company s major uses of cash have historically been for acquisitions  working capital to support sales growth and ongoing capital expenditures for facilities and equipment improvement 
sources of cash have typically included operating cash flow  bank borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common stock 
in october   the company completed a secondary offering pursuant to which the company issued and sold  shares of its common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used the net proceeds of this offering to reduce debt  and to expand its manufacturing infrastructure primarily through acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the company s cash on hand as  of november   was million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  for the year ended november   and the cash used in investing activities totaled million

net cash provided by financing activities aggregated million  which included million in net borrowings under the company s credit facilities and repurchases of common stock totaling million 
in connection with the sli acquisition reference note in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements on september   the company entered into a new bank financing agreement 
the agreement provides for a million  secured  revolving credit facility  which includes i a million foreign currency facility  and ii a million letter of credit facility

the company conducts business in countries outside of the united states which exposes the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge this risk according to its outlook on future exchange rates  nevertheless  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes that cash from operations and borrowings available under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
seasonality in view of the acquisition of sli  it is expected that the company s operations will experience certain seasonal patterns 
generally  sli s sales have been highest in the fourth quarter of each year due to abbreviated daylight hours and increase holiday light usage 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have a time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for the year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project within one year but not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
the project cost associated with new software acquired at the time of the sli and power lighting products acquisitions does not impact the company s year project cost estimate 
the remaining costs attributable to these new software purchases are estimated to total approximately million 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertanties
