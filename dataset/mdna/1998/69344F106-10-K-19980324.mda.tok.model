item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
description of forward looking statements 
this portion of this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to revenues  gross margins  expenditures on research and development  and sufficiency of capital resources 
actual results may differ from those projected in the forward looking statements for a number of reasons  including those described in risk factors 
general 
pmc designs  develops  markets and supports high performance silicon solutions for advanced communications markets 
the company s products are used in the broadband communications infrastructure and high bandwidth networks 
in the third quarter of  the company announced its decision to exit from the personal computer modem chipset business  to restructure its non networking operations and to focus on its networking semiconductor businesses 
consistent with this strategy  the company acquired  in the third quarter of  ethernet switching assets  intellectual property and certain other assets from bipolar integrated technology bit 
in the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued operations of prometheus products inc prometheus 
results of operations net revenues  change change networking products user interface other user interface modem total net revenues net revenues declined in as a result of the company s third quarter strategic decision to exit the modem chipset business  restructure its other non networking business and to focus on its networking semiconductor business 
networking product revenue grew in compared to due to the continued strong demand for the broadband networking equipment in which the company s products are used 
industry analysts expect sales of networking equipment to increase in the coming year 
the company expects that if such increase occurs  the company s revenues from networking products will increase 
revenue from products classified as user interface other  which include custom  graphic  and other semiconductors declined in from levels 
the company is supporting these products for its existing customers  but has decided not to do any follow on products of this type 
further substantial declines are expected in user interface other revenue in the coming year 
the disposal of the company s modem chipset inventories and the exit from that business was completed in no future revenues are expected from that business 
net revenues in remained approximately at the same level as revenues 
substantial growth in sales of networking products  and a small increase in modem chipset product sales  were offset by declines in other user interface products  which were primarily due to lower sales of graphic chip products 
the small increase in modem chipset sales over resulted from increased unit sales of both v 
and v 
modem products in the first half of the year  while in the second half of the year the company experienced declining unit sales and substantially lower prices for modem products 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of net networking revenues user interface products percentage of net user interface revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit increased from to as a result of increased sales of higher gross margin networking products offsetting the decline in gross profit due to lower revenues from the company s user interface products and due to lower wafer costs in than in the prior year 
user interface gross profit in was reduced by a million inventory charge related to the company s decision to exit the modem chipset business 
gross profits on user interface products in  which includes the gross profits from modem chipset sales  as well as the gross profits on sales from other non networking products  were higher than historical levels due to the sales and cost of sales of modem chipset inventories 
in establishing its reserve for the write down of its modem chipset inventories  the company took into account both the costs of completion and disposal in revaluing the inventory to the lower of cost or market 
the higher amount of gross profit recognized during the first half of and included in the results represents the amount necessary to cover the relatively higher period expenses incurred relating to the disposal effort 
there was no operating profit recognized from the sale of modem chipset products 
total gross profit increased from to as a result of increased sales of higher gross margin networking products as a percentage of total net revenues 
the company expects that networking gross profits as a percentage of networking net revenues may experience a decline if anticipated decreases in average selling prices of existing networking products are not offset by commensurate reductions in production costs  or by an offsetting increase in gross profit contribution from new higher gross margin networking products 
other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues in process research development percentage of net revenues marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues purchase price adjustment compensation percentage of net revenues restructure costs percentage of net revenues research and development 
research and development expenses decreased in primarily due to the discontinuance of spending on user interface products  partially offset by increased spending on networking products 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development spending on the company s networking products is higher in all periods than research and development spending on the company s user interface products 
the increase in research and development spending in over was primarily due to greater spending on the development of networking products 
the company expects research and development costs to increase in the future with all spending related to its networking products 
in process research and development 
in process research and development charges incurred in are a result of the acquisition of the ethernet switching and other assets from bit 
marketing  general  and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses declined primarily due to the reduction in expenses and personnel resulting from the third quarter restructuring of the non networking operations 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects increased spending on networking products and a decline in total net revenues 
spending on marketing  general and administrative expenses did not change substantially between and as increases related to its networking products  primarily related to increased staffing  were offset by declines in these expenses and the headcount of user interface groups due to the restructuring 
purchase price adjustment 
in completing the acquisition of the networking business in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million charge relating to the compensation expense associated with the purchase price adjustment shares reserved for issuance to the employee shareholders of the acquired business 
the million balance of the acquisition cost was allocated to goodwill 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
restructure and other costs 
restructure costs are part of a million charge recorded in connection with the company s decision to exit from the modem chipset business and the associated restructuring of the company s other non networking product operations 
all material aspects of the restructuring were completed by the end of when the company recorded a recovery of million from the reversal of the excess accrued restructure charge 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
year computer systems issues 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the limitations of the programming code in many existing computer systems  whereby the computer systems may not properly recognize date sensitive information as the next millennium year approaches 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company uses commercially available standard software for its critical operating and financial applications 
one vendor of software used by the company is still modifying its code to become year compliant and anticipates completion early in if the vendor does not successfully modify its code the company could be forced to purchase a competing system that is year compliant and incur installation and other costs 
the installation of a replacement system for those applications that are currently not year compliant is not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company s suppliers and customers are generally much larger organizations than the company with a greater number of suppliers and customers of their own 
the company believes that many of its suppliers and customers have not completed their own systems modification to be year compliant 
the failure of significant suppliers or customers of the company to become year compliant could have material adverse consequences to the company 
those consequences could include the inability to receive product in a timely manner or lost sales opportunities either of which could result in a material decline in the company s revenues and profits 
interest income  net  change change interest income expense  net percentage of net revenues interest income  net 
interest income increased in and due to higher cash balances available to invest and earn interest 
interest expense increased in and due principally to increased debt associated with capital lease obligations 
gain on sale of sitel sierra 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold its interest in sitel sierra  bv to national semiconductor corporation for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
the company acquired its shares of sitel sierra  bv  a joint venture with tritech microelectronics pte 
ltd 
of singapore  in in exchange for the contribution of a license to certain technology owned by the company and certain assets of sierra semiconductor b 
v  the company s subsidiary 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision reflects taxes provided for the company s foreign operations which are primarily in canada 
us taxes for were eliminated by tax losses realized from the company s restructuring 
the income tax rate reflects the effect of a nondeductible million charge for the purchase of in process research and development relating to the bit acquisition and taxes on foreign operations 
the us tax provision was reduced by the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
the modem chipset business restructure charge of million did not result in a tax benefit because of the uncertainty of future us income as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
the income tax provision reflects the effect of a nondeductible million charge for the purchase price adjustment of the company s canadian networking business discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and its board of directors reached a decision to offer prometheus for sale and  as a result  it was reported as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a million charge to discontinued operations to write down the assets and accrue additional liabilities including a provision for future losses from operations 
the effort to sell prometheus was not successful and the company has subsequently completed the closure of prometheus 
hardware and technical support functions related to product warranty support on the installed base of products previously sold were carried out in and with costs recorded against the discontinued operations provision established in liquidity and capital resources 
the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of during the company s operating activities provided million in cash which included million in net income and million in depreciation and amortization as well as the working capital impact of completing the restructuring 
investing activities included million in purchases of new plant and equipment during and proceeds from the disposal of assets  most of which were related to the non networking business  of million 
the company increased its short term investments by million during the year 
the company used a net million in cash during to decrease its debt and capital lease obligations 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock  principally under the company s stock option and purchase plans  totaled million 
as at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the restructure charge  the company s line of credit agreement with a bank was renegotiated to allow the company to borrow up to million under the line of credit  provided that each borrowing is fully secured by cash 
there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit at the end of either or the company cannot sell  transfer  assign  mortgage  pledge  lease  grant a security interest or encumber any of its assets without the bank s prior written consent 
the completion of the restructuring in the fourth quarter of has resulted in the company being able to negotiate with a number of banks to obtain a new line of credit 
the company expects that a less restrictive line will be available in to replace the current line of credit which expires march  the company has wafer supply agreements with two independent foundries that together supply substantially all of the company s products and include deposits made to secure access to wafer fabrication capacity 
one of those supply agreements was amended in the fourth quarter of while the other was rewritten in the fourth quarter of and amended in the third quarter of at december  and  the company had million in deposits with those foundries and was in compliance with its foundry agreements 
although there are no minimum unit volume requirements  the company is obligated under one of the foundry agreements to purchase in future periods a minimum percentage of its total annual wafer requirements  provided that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive technology  pricing  quality and delivery 
non compliance with the terms of the agreements may be cause for termination of the agreement by either party 
the company purchased million from its foundry suppliers during compared to million under agreements in existence in those amounts may or may not be indicative of any future period since wafers are sold based on current market pricing and the company s volume requirements change in relation to sales of its products 
in each year  the company is able to receive a portion of the deposits provided to the foundries based on the annual purchases from those foundries as compared to the target levels in the agreements 
based on purchases the company is expected to receive a million refund from one of the foundries in the first quarter of if the company does not receive the balance of its deposits back during the course of the agreements  then the deposits will be returned to the company at the termination of the agreements 
the company believes that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the company expects to purchase or arrange capital leases for approximately million of new capital expenditures during in actual capital expenditures and capital leases totaled million 
no additional deposits to secure foundry capacity are expected in the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  product development  deposits for additional wafer fabrication capacity  and acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that existing resources and funds generated by future earnings are insufficient to fund the company s operations  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the company s common stock 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  limit or eliminate some or all of its proposed operations which could have a material adverse impact on the company
