overview the company is a leading provider of telecommunications transmission  switched long distance and associated services to long distance and other communications companies 
the company s network is expected to include over  digital route miles by the end of the first quarter of additions to the network are currently under construction 
subject to the availability of capital and the completion of cost sharing arrangements currently being negotiated  the network is planned to include over  digital route miles by the end of  and over  digital route miles by the end of the company provides two principal products transmission of voice and data over dedicated circuits private lines and transmission of long distance traffic processed through the company s switches long distance switched services 
during the first quarter of  the company began providing frame relay and atm based switched data services in order to capitalize on the growing demand for internet and electronic data transfer services 
private line business 
substantially all of the company s revenue in and prior years  approximately of its revenue for and for was generated by its private line business  which has historically provided positive ebitda and cash flow even in years when the company incurred net losses 
the company provides private line service to customers generally either on a take or pay long term basis or  after contract expiration  on a month to month basis 
the company s private line transmission agreements are generally long term leases which provide for monthly payment in advance on a fixed rate basis  calculated according to the capacity and length of the circuit used 
during  the company leased transmission capacity to over customers  with the five largest private line customers during that year accounting for approximately of private line revenue and approximately of the company s total revenue 
three of the company s largest private line customers  at t  worldcom and frontier  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue in the largest component of the cost of services of the private line business is the expense of leasing off net capacity from other carriers to meet customer needs which the company cannot currently meet with its own network due to capacity or geographic constraints 
in the normal course of business the company has entered into capacity exchange agreements with other carriers 
pursuant to such agreements  the company exchanges excess capacity on its network with other carriers for capacity on the other carriers networks 
such exchange agreements generally do not provide for cash payments to be made  but rather allow the company to substantially reduce the cash payments it must make for off net capacity from other carriers 
such exchanges are accounted for at the fair value of the capacity exchanged  as non cash revenue and expense in equal amounts over the term of the agreements 
in  and the company recorded revenue and expense of million  million and  respectively  relating to such exchanges 
long distance switched services business 
at the end of  the company expanded into the business of selling long distance switched services to long distance resellers 
in and  this business contributed and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company sells these services on a per call basis  charging by the mous  with payment due monthly after services are rendered 
the company s rates for calls generally vary with the duration of the call  the day and time of day the call was made and whether the traffic is intrastate  interstate or international 
at december   the company had over long distance reseller customers 
the company has achieved significant revenue growth since it began offering long distance switched services 
the company s largest switched services customer  excel  accounted for approximately of the switched long distance business and approximately of the company s total revenue in the three main components of long distance switched services business costs are access costs with lecs and other providers  the expense of leasing off net capacity from other carriers  and operations and administration expenses 
the lec access charges  which are usage based and vary according to the lata in which calls originate and terminate  represent a majority of the total costs for the long distance switched services business 
long distance network leasing costs are incurred as the company leases capacity to carry traffic to areas where its network does not reach or is already running at or near capacity 
as the company transfers traffic onto its newly constructed network routes  the company expects to realize cost savings because it will be able to reduce the amount of long distance network capacity that otherwise would be required to be leased from other parties 
however  the company does not intend to expand its network to all areas of the united states 
accordingly  the company anticipates that it will continue to lease capacity from other carriers regardless of the network expansion 
because the long distance switched services business generally has lower margins than the private line business  increases in switched long distance volumes have caused and will continue to cause a decrease in the company s overall margins 
although the company has been successful in establishing its nationwide long distance switched services business with significant revenue  ebitda for the long distance switched services business has historically been negative through and may be negative in ebitda losses in the long distance switched services business were greatly reduced during the second half of  with consecutive quarter losses being reduced over from the second to the third quarter and over from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
the company believes the improvements in operating results from long distance switched services are the result of three major factors first  the company historically priced its interstate services to customers at a blended rate based upon the expected usage and mix of traffic between high access cost and low access cost latas 
during certain of the company s customers generated switched traffic comprised of a substantially higher mix of minutes originating or terminating in high access cost latas than was anticipated at the time the customer contracts were negotiated and pricing established 
during the second half of  this situation improved significantly as the company established rates more directly related to the customer s actual mix of traffic 
however  the company experienced substantial negative gross profits in the fourth quarter of with respect to international services delivered to a high volume customer due to unfavorable international settlement costs not adequately covered by the prices charged to the customer 
the company no longer offers such services to the customer 
second  the company configures its switched network to account for the expected traffic distribution of its customers 
in certain areas during the first half of  traffic volume was higher than expected causing certain of the company s switches to run at capacity and requiring the company to overflow excess traffic onto other carriers switched networks 
the company has added ports to its existing switches and deployed two additional switches to better manage the current and projected volumes and mixes of traffic in order to enhance network efficiency 
third  the company benefitted from the impact of the fcc mandated rate reductions for the connection charges paid by the long distance carriers to lec s 
there can be no assurance that the improvements in long distance switched services ebitda experienced during the last half of will continue in the future 
in addition  some increases in certain elements of access charges are anticipated in mid  although the overall effect of access charge reform on the company is uncertain 
the company expects that as competition increases  prices for both private line and long distance switched services will decline 
these price declines will effect both the company s revenue and its cost of services 
capital expenditures 
the company has spent significant amounts of capital to develop its coast to coast network to service its private line  long distance switched services and other businesses and is continuing a substantial expansion of its network 
on a cash basis  the company spent million for capital expenditures during and estimates that it will spend approximately million in the company expects to continue making substantial capital expenditures thereafter for additional fiber expansion and the deployment of additional optronics to provide capacity for revenue growth  as well as additional voice and data switches for anticipated growth in voice and data traffic 
acquisition transactions 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to acquire nld  a provider of long distance services to businesses and association programs  agents and other long distance carriers 
nld has annualized revenue in excess of million 
the transaction is intended to be a tax free  pooling of interests merger in which the nld shares will be acquired for approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction  which requires regulatory approvals and nld shareholder approval  is anticipated to close in mid joint ventures 
marca tel  a joint venture in which the company indirectly holds a minority interest  obtained a license from the mexican government to provide certain telecommunication services in mexico 
the company has contributed million as of december  to progress international which owns a interest in marca tel  substantially all of which funds have been used to fund marca tel at december  the company accounts for its investment in progress international and indirect investment in marca tel using the equity method and  as a result  records a percentage of marca tel s operating results profits or losses 
in october  the company formed a joint venture with telenor as  the norwegian national telephone company  to provide telecommunication services to carriers and resellers in nine european countries 
the joint venture is owned percent by the company  percent by telenor  and percent by clarion resources communications corporation  a us based telecommunications company in which telenor owns a controlling interest

subject to the terms of the joint venture agreement  upon request of the president of the joint venture  the company is obligated to invest up to an additional million during and after november   it may be obligated to invest up to an additional million 
after its funding obligation is fulfilled  the company is not required to fund any future investments to the joint venture  but to the extent unidial funds such investments alone  the company s interest in the joint venture may be diluted 
psinet transaction 
to enhance the company s product and service offerings  in february  the company consummated agreements with psinet which allow each party to market and sell the products and services of the other party 
under the terms of the agreements  the company will provide psinet with an iru in  miles of oc transmission capacity on its network over a year period in exchange for approximately million shares representing post issuance of psinet common stock 
if the value of the psinet common stock received by the company is less than million at the earlier of one year after the final delivery of the transmission capacity scheduled for late or four years after the transaction s closing  psinet  at its option  will pay the company cash and or deliver additional psinet common stock to increase the value of the cash and common stock paid by psinet to million 
upon delivery of the transmission capacity to psinet  the company will begin to receive a maintenance fee which  as the full capacity has been delivered  should increase to approximately million per year 
the company will account for its investment in psinet using the equity method and  as a result will record a percentage of psinet s operating results profits or losses 
fiber sales and irus 
in connection with the network expansion  the company has entered into various agreements to sell fiber usage rights 
sales of fiber usage rights are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue is recognized over the terms of the related agreements 
in  the company received approximately million in cash from these sales but recognized only approximately 
million as revenue from these sales

quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the company s quarters in and this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k and includes all adjustments which consist only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results set forth herein 
the company s quarterly results have in the past been subject to fluctuations  and thus  the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the company may experience substantial fluctuations in quarterly results in the future as a result of various factors  including customer turnover  variations in the success of its customers businesses and price competition 
in addition  delays in completion of the construction of new network routes could cause quarterly results to vary

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared with net operating revenue for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily a result of both the increased growth of the company s long distance switched services business and private line business 
long distance switched services revenue increased to million for compared to million for billable mous were billion in  compared to billion for revenue per mou decreased from c in the fourth quarter of to c in the fourth quarter of due to competitive price pressure  which is expected to continue 
revenue for the company s private line business for increased to million from million for the private line increase in revenue correlates with the additional fiber capacity available  or anticipated to be available  on the network 
cost of services consists principally of access charges paid to lecs and transmission lease payments to  and exchanges with  other carriers 
cost of services for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily a result of additional leases for transmission capacity supporting the company s private line and switched long distance services businesses  mous provided by other carriers and access charges paid to lecs in connection with the increased long distance switched services revenue 
cost of services increased faster on a percentage basis than revenue principally because switched long distance services revenues which represent an increasing portion of total revenues generate substantially lower gross margins than private line revenues and because of certain uneconomic customer contracts that the company had in the first two quarters of and an uneconomic customer contract that the company had in the fourth quarter of the company has historically had a relatively low cost of services as a percentage of revenue because substantially all its revenue was derived from private line services  generally made at a relatively low cost over its own network 
cost of services in the switched long distance services business are substantially greater than in the private line business due to the additional costs of lec access charges  leases for long distance circuits and mous obtained from other carriers 
in july the fcc mandated rate reductions for the connection charges paid by the long distance carriers to lec s 
the favorable impact of these rate reductions are reflected in the financial statements 
the company expects its cost of services as a percentage of revenue to increase over historical results as the switched services revenue becomes a larger share of the company s business 
operations and administration expenses for increased to million from million for this increase is primarily the result of employee costs and other operating expenses associated with the growth in the company s network 
the company anticipates that as it expands its long distance switched services business and its fiber network  including the projected integration of nld s operations into the company  operations and administration expenses will continue to increase  but will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily the result of depreciation related to portions of the company s network completed during depreciation and amortization will increase in subsequent periods  as the company s continuing investment in newly constructed routes and other network equipment is depreciated 
interest income for decreased from million for to million as proceeds from the company s and debt and equity placements were used to construct the company s network and operate its business 
the decrease from was offset partially by the interest earned on the proceeds of the company s sale of million of the convertible preferred stock in april and million of the exchangeable preferred stock in august interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease is primarily the result of additional capitalization of interest related to the fiber network construction 
equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries for were million compared to million in these losses primarily relate to the company s share of losses in the mexican joint venture  which began operations during the first quarter of  while continuing to complete its network construction 
at december   the company s net carrying value in its investment in the mexican joint venture was million 
in february  marca tel announced that it was putting further investment on new fiber routes on hold  awaiting more suitable regulatory and market conditions 
failure to provide further significant funding to progress international is likely to result in a default under marca tel s financing arrangements and could result in the foreclosure of a third party s security interest in progress international s interest in marca tel 
the company s interest in progress international  and thus its indirect interest in marca tel  therefore could be diluted or lost entirely 
income tax expense for was million compared to a benefit of million for the increase occurred because the company recognized tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of federal income tax examinations in for accounting purposes  the company is not recognizing any tax benefits relating to losses incurred during both and the company experienced a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million for compared to million for as a result of the factors discussed above and the increase in preferred stock dividends in the increase in preferred stock dividends of million is the result of issuance of the convertible preferred stock in april and the exchangeable preferred stock in august compared with net operating revenue for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily a result of the successful commencement of the company s long distance switched services business particularly the addition of excel as a customer 
switched long distance services revenue were million for compared to million for 
the vast majority of this revenue was generated in the third and fourth quarters of billable mous were million for revenue per mou decreased from c in the first quarter of to c in the fourth quarter of this decrease resulted from competitive price pressure  which is expected to continue 
revenue for the company s private line business for increased to million from million for cost of services for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily a result of the addition of long distance leases supporting the long distance switched services business  mous leased from other carriers and access charges paid to lecs in connection with the long distance switched services business 
the company did not incur any significant expenses for the long distance switched services business during operations and administration expenses for increased to million from million for this increase is primarily the result of employee costs and other operating expenses associated with the company s long distance switched services business 
depreciation and amortization for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily the result of depreciation related to capital expenditures associated with the company s expansion and improvement of its network 
interest income for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily related to interest earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes issued in october and the interest earned in on the investment of the proceeds from the ipo and the gept private placement 
interest expense for increased to million from million for the increase is primarily the result of interest expense attributable to the senior notes  which were issued during the fourth quarter of equity in the net loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries for was million in compared to slight income for the loss was primarily the result of start up losses relating to the company s investment in its mexican joint venture 
income taxes for resulted in a million tax benefit compared to a benefit of million for the difference between the tax benefits recorded for and the expected benefit at the federal statutory rate is primarily due to state taxes  losses incurred the tax benefit of which is not recorded due to uncertainty regarding its realization  and resolution of federal income tax examinations which were concluded in the second and third quarters of the company experienced a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources except for the historical information contained below  the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual liquidity needs  capital resources and results may differ materially from the discussion set forth below in such forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could materially affect such matters  see business risk factors 
through  the company s private line operations provided positive cash flow with adequate liquidity to meet the company s operational needs 
however  the company s capital expenditures and  since the issuance of the senior notes in the fourth quarter of  its interest expense and operating losses  have been financed with the proceeds of debt and equity securities 
for and  the company s ebitda minus interest expense minus capital expenditures plus the increases in working capital were negative million and negative million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in  primarily due to the current year s proceeds relating to fiber rights sales in of million  off set primarily by increases in net losses 
cash used in investing activities in was million  primarily from the company s capital spending of million and investment in non consolidated subsidiaries chiefly the mexican joint venture of million being partially offset by the release of million of funds from escrow under the senior notes 
in cash provided by investing activities was million as million in capital expenditures and million of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were offset by million in net release of funds from escrow under the senior notes 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the year over year increase was due to million in net proceeds from issuing the convertible preferred stock in april and in net proceeds from issuing the exchangeable preferred stock in august in  the net cash provided by financing activities was largely due to million from issuing common stock offset mainly by payments of debt service 
as of february   the company had approximately million in cash 
the company anticipates incurring a substantial amount of additional indebtedness in the company is in discussions with various investment bankers  vendors and lending institutions regarding substantial additional equity and or debt financing for and beyond 
the company seeks to obtain sufficient funding from these sources plus cash receipts from fiber sales and operations for the following major uses of cash i the network expansion and other capital expenditures  ii debt service  iii lease payments  iv funding its joint ventures  and v working capital 
capital spending in is projected to be approximately million 
after  capital expenditures are expected to be reduced  but continue to be substantial 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to meet its needs 
a failure to raise cash would delay or prevent such capital expenditures and the construction of the network expansion 
also  the foregoing capital expenditure and cash requirements for do not take into account any acquisitions 
the company is required to make interest payments in the amount of million on the senior notes each year 
for  ebitda was insufficient to cover the company s debt service requirements under the senior notes 
the company anticipates that such payments during will be made from cash on hand 
the company is also required to make principal payments of million on other debt in including quarterly principal payments of  from march  through december  in october  the company exchanged of its series preferred stock for common stock 
each stockholder of series preferred stock received shares of common stock for each share of series preferred stock 
as a result of this exchange  shares of series preferred stock were retired and  shares of common stock were issued 
at december   the aggregate liquidation preference of the remaining outstanding series preferred stock was  the company expects to redeem the remaining series preferred stock during the company is required to make minimum annual lease payments for facilities  equipment and transmission capacity used in its operations 
in  and the company is currently required to make payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively  on capital leases and million  million and million  respectively  on operating leases 
the company expects to incur additional operating and capital lease costs in connection with the network expansion 
in connection with its network expansion  the company has entered into various construction and installation agreements with contractors 
total commitments remaining under these agreements were approximately million at december  these commitments are expected to be paid during in connection with the network expansion  as of december   the company had committed to pay million in shared construction costs for fiber usage rights on other long distance carriers networks 
estimates of these shared construction costs are included in the company s capital expenditure estimates 
pursuant to these agreements relating to the construction of the network expansion  the company has committed to pay a total of million for periods ranging from twenty to twenty five years for maintenance and license fees 
at the present time  the company does not anticipate significant additional funding to progress international for investment in marca tel until the regulatory and market conditions in mexico improve 
the company is not obligated to continue to fund progress international and the senior notes indenture and the terms of the exchangeable preferred stock contain significant limitations on the amount the company may invest in progress international and other non majority owned entities 
however  failure to provide further significant funding to progress international is likely to result in a default under marca tel s financing arrangements and could result in the foreclosure of the third party s security interest 
the company s interest in progress international  and thus its indirect interest in marca tel  therefore could be diluted or lost entirely 
see business mexican joint venture 
the forward looking statements set forth above with respect to the estimated cash requirements relating to capital expenditures  the company s ability to meet such cash requirements and the company s ability to service its debt are based on certain assumptions as to future events 
important assumptions  which if not met  could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve satisfactory results include that i there will be no significant delays or cost overruns with respect to the network expansion  ii the company s contractors and partners in cost saving arrangements will perform their obligations  iii rights of way can be obtained in a timely  cost effective basis  iv the routes of the network expansion scheduled for completion in are substantially completed on schedule  v the company will continue to increase traffic on its network  and vi the company can obtain vendor financing 
year risks certain of the company s older computer programs identify years with two digits instead of four 
this is likely to cause problems because the programs may recognize the year as the year these year problems could result in a system failure or miscalculations disrupting operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment identifying which programs will have to be modified or replaced in order to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company believes that the cost of modifying those systems that were not already scheduled for replacement for business reasons prior to is immaterial 
updating the current software to be year compliant is scheduled to be completed by mid  prior to any anticipated impact on operating systems 
although the company does not expect year problems to have a material adverse effect on its internal operations  it is possible that year problems could have a material adverse effect on i the company s suppliers and their ability to service the company  to accurately invoice for services rendered and to accurately process payments received  and ii the company s customers and their ability to continue to utilize the company s services  to collect from their customers and to pay the company for services received 
the cumulative effect of such problems  if they occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company and the value of the common stock and its other securities
