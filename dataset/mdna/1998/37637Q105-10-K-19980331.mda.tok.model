item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general glacier bancorp  inc the company is a delaware corporation with four commercial banks as subsidiaries  glacier bank  glacier bank of whitefish formerly first national bank of whitefish  glacier bank of eureka formerly first national bank of eureka  and first security bank of missoula 
the company reported earnings of  for the year ended december   or basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  compared to  or basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   and  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  during the fdic saif fund was recapitalized through one time payments from thrift institutions 
glacier bank s after tax cost of this payment was  or 
basic earnings per share 
in addition  expenses related to the merger of first security bank were  or 
basic earnings per share 
operating earnings without the saif and merger expenses were  or basic earnings per share 
this continued improvement in net income can be attributed to an increase in earning assets  management of net interest margin  and strong non interest income 
the following narrative and charts focus on the significant financial changes which have taken place over the past years and include a discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
this source of funds is generated by deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  sales of loans and securities  short and long term borrowings  and net income 
in addition  all four subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank of seattle 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances which serve as a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes  during  all four financial institutions maintained liquidity at a level deemed sufficient to meet operating cash needs 
the liquidity was in excess of regulatory requirements 
retention of a portion of glacier bancorp  inc s earnings results in stockholders equity at december  of  or of assets  which compares with  or of assets at december  earnings retention has kept pace with the increase in assets of  or  during the stockholders equity ratio remains well above required regulatory levels  and above the average of the company s peers  providing flexibility in the management of assets 
financial condition for the year ended december   consolidated assets increased  or  over the prior year 
the following table summarizes the company s major asset and liability components in percentage terms at december    and major balance sheet components as a percentage of total assets december  assets cash  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock 
real estate loans commercial loans installment other loans other assets liabilities and stockholders equity deposit accounts fhlb advances other borrowings and repurchase agreements other liabilities stockholders equity real estate loans continue to be the largest component of the company s assets  although the percentage is decreasing  and commercial loans are increasing as a result of the company s strategy 
deposit accounts  with comparatively short terms to maturity  represent the majority of the liabilities 
effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a positive gap position at six months  and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a positive 
which compares to a positive at december   and a negative gap of 
at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the traditional one dimensional view of gap is no longer sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
superior earnings power is also a key factor in reducing exposure to higher interest rates 
for example  our gap earnings sensitivity ratio shows that a change in interest rates would only change income by 
because of our gap position  the table illustrates how a increase in rates would decrease the company s income by approximately  using this analysis to join gap information with earnings data  it produces a better picture of our strength and ability to handle interest rate change 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity 
estimate of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities gap and gap coverage ratios at december  projected maturity in months as of december  over dollars in thousands months months months total rate sensitive assets interest bearing deposits investments and mortgage backed securities 
    loans floating rate     fixed rate     total rate sensitive assets     rate sensitive liabilities deposit accounts     fhlb advances     other borrowings repurchase agreements   total rate sensitive liabilities     cumulative gap   cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets of  gap earnings sensitivity gap earnings sensitivity ratio based on scheduled maturity or time before the loan can be repriced 
loans also reflect estimated amortization and prepayments 
gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on income after taxes at of a increase or decrease in interest rates x  less tax of 
gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the estimated yearly earnings of  a increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage increase decrease effect on annual income 
interest rate spread one way to protect against interest rate volatility is to maintain a comfortable interest spread between yields on assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as shown below the net interest spread decreased in from to  primarily the result of lower rates on interest earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased slightly in from to  also the result of a decrease in rates on interest earning assets 
although the interest spread is down from the increased asset levels  and the increased interest free funding resulted in significantly higher net interest income

weighted averages are computed without the effect of compounding daily interest

the net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets is interest income from loans and investments less interest expense from deposits  fhlb advances  and other borrowings  divided by the total amount of earning assets 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  financial condition total assets increased  or over the december  asset level 
total net loans outstanding increased  or  with the largest increase occurring in the commercial classification which increased  or  followed by installment loans which increased  or 
real estate loans increased  or a result of a significant portion of the loan production being sold 
investment securities decreased  or

total liabilities increased  or  with interest bearing deposits up  or  and non interest bearing deposits up  or 
federal home loan bank advances decreased  or 
securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds were up  or

total stockholders equity increased  or  primarily the result of earnings retention  and by an increase in the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of  results of operations interest income interest income was  compared to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a  or increase 
the weighted average yield on the loan and investment portfolios decreased slightly from to 
this decrease in yield was offset by increased volumes in loans  resulting in the increased interest income 
interest rates were lower at the end of than early in the year  with little slope in the yield curve 
a continued decline in interest rates could result in lower interest income resulting from the refinance of existing loans 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december   up from  in  a  or increase  the increase is due to higher balances in interest bearing deposits  increases in amounts outstanding in repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds during this increase was partially offset by reduced federal home loan bank borrowings

year issues the year creates challenges with respect to the automated systems used by financial institutions and other companies 
many computer programs are not able to distinguish the year from the year  due to the practice of using only two digits to represent years in the s eg represents january  
thus  most current automated systems will interpret as january  this challenge is especially problematic for financial institutions  since many transactions  such as interest accruals and payments  are date sensitive 
in addition  the problem is not limited to computer systems 
year issues will potentially affect every system that has an embedded microchip  such as automated teller machines  elevators  and vaults 
it may also affect the operations of third parties with whom the company and banks do business 
the company and the banks are committed to addressing these year challenges in a prompt and responsible manner  and they have dedicated resources to do so 
management has completed an assessment of its automated systems and has implemented a program to complete all necessary steps to resolve these issues  including purchasing appropriate computer technology 
as part of this program  management will monitor the efforts and success of its suppliers  service providers  and large corporate customers  in meeting their year challenges 
updating and testing of the company s and the banks automated systems is currently underway and will be substantially complete well before the millennium 
the financial effect of these year challenges on the company is impossible to predict with certainty at this time 
however  management does not believe that expenses related to year challenges will have a material effect on the operations or financial performance of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  as compared to the board approved policy limit 
estimated rate change nii sensitivity bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
