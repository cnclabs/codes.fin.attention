accordingly  the company will derive its revenues from the distributions paid to the company through billion luck by harc resulting from distributions paid by the operating subsidiaries 
harc pays distributions to its shareholders in accordance with their percentage interests as follows billion luck  guilinyang farm and farming bureau 
the statements under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources relate to the operations and financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries 
the operating subsidiaries were originally established as state owned enterprises in the prc by the farming bureau  a division of the ministry of agriculture of prc 
harc was established on june   to act as the holding company of the operating subsidiaries 
the operating subsidiaries principally engage in the marketing and distribution of raw natural rubber produced by the hainan state farms and non state farms  and in the trading of natural rubber commodities futures contracts to hedge the price risk associated with certain firm commitments for the purchase of natural rubber 
as opportunities arise  the operating subsidiaries also enter into natural rubber commodities futures contracts that are not specific hedges  in anticipation of a rise or fall in the price of natural rubber  based on their knowledge of the supply and demand situation with respect to natural rubber in the prc 
they also procure certain production materials and supplies which include fertilizers  fuels  chemicals  farm equipment and machinery  and automobiles for the farming bureau  the hainan state farms and other unaffiliated customers 
in  harc and the operating subsidiaries also diversified into trading of other agricultural products like coffee beans 
prior to  selling prices of natural rubber were generally set by the farming bureau in order to control the gross profit margin earned by the operating subsidiaries 
commencing in  however  the farming bureau generally ceased establishing the selling price of natural rubber  and instead allowed operating subsidiaries to determine the selling price according to market conditions  subject to a minimum gross profit margin of on natural rubber purchased from the hainan state farms 
generally  materials and supplies are sold at a higher profit margin than that of natural rubber 
the primary cost of operating the business is the materials cost of natural rubber and other materials and supplies  as well as selling and administrative expenses 
pursuant to the restructuring agreements  harc and the operating subsidiaries agreed to assign to the farming bureau the amounts due from the farms and the affiliates of the farming bureau as of september   and the farming bureau agreed to assume the obligations under the short term bank loans  as part of the corporate restructuring plan 
the assignment of amounts due from farms and affiliates of the farming bureau was effective on october   and the assignments of short term bank loans were effective upon approval of such banks on march  and march  as of september   the aggregate amount due from the farms and affiliates of the farming bureau amounted to approximately rmb million us million  and the short term bank loans amounted to approximately rmb million us million 
according to the restructuring agreements  the farming bureau was responsible for the payment of interest incurred on the bank loans after september  results of operations the following table shows the selected audited consolidated income statement data of the company and its subsidiaries for the three fiscal years ended december   and the data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere therein in thousands year ended december  rmb rmb rmb us audited audited audited audited historical historical historical historical net sales distribution of natural rubber     procurement of materials and supplies and distribution of other agricultural products     gross profit     gross profit margin income before income taxes     income taxes     net income before minority interests     minority interests     net income after minority interests     year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales and gross profit total net sales for the year ended december   decreased by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in net sales of natural rubber declined by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in net sales revenue for the procurement of materials and supplies decreased significantly by rmb million or to rmb million  compared to rmb million for the corresponding period in the decline in natural rubber sales was mainly due to the decrease in average natural rubber price from approximately rmb  per ton in to approximately rmb  per ton in  while the sales quantity remained relatively stable in as compared with the corresponding period in the decline in rubber price was primarily the result of the keen competition from overseas suppliers 
as previously discussed  the outbreak of currency crisis in the southeast asia since the second half year of caused a significant currency deflation of most asian currencies against us dollars  including the largest natural rubber producing countries like thailand  indonesia and malaysia  while the exchange rate of renminbi against us dollars remained relatively stable in this currenciy deflation caused a significant decline in the international rubber price by approximately during the weak domestic consumption market together with the influx of imported rubber caused the overall domestic supply of natural rubber to exceed demand 
net sales from procurement of materials and supplies dropped significantly because of the weak consumption market in following the completion of private offshore placements during  the company had expanded into trading of other agricultural products  such as coffee beans which were in high demand in china as a result of the active trading of coffee commodity futures in china in the net sales of such activity amounted to rmb million in with a gross profit margin of approximately 
in  the company has decided to reduce the scope in trading of other agricultural products in view of the weak consumption market and high volatility of the prices of such products 
the company also has determined to reduce the scope of trading of certain production materials and supplies  such as construction materials  machinery and automobiles  because of unsatisfactory historical profit margin contribution 
gross profits decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in the overall gross profit margin also decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in scope of trading of other agricultural products which had high gross margin contribution in the gross profit margin on natural rubber distribution was in compared to in the increase was due to compensation received from customers who defaulted in fulfilling their purchase agreements 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in this was primarily due to the successful implementation of the corporate restructuring and cost control measures in order to reduce administrative overhead  staff costs and related expenses pursuant to the restructuring agreements effective on october  financial expenses  net the net financial expenses changed from a net expense of rmb million in to a net income of rmb  in this significant reduction of financial expenses was primarily attributable to the assignment of bank loans to farming bureau which were effective upon the approval of such banks in march  pursuant to the restructuring agreements effective on october  according to the restructuring agreements  the farming bureau was responsible for the payment of interest incurred on the bank loans after september  other income  net other income increased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in this significant increase was primarily due to the increase in profit from the trading of commodity futures contracts for non hedging purposes 
a profit on the trading of commodity futures of rmb million was recorded for the year  compared to a profit of only rmb million for the year year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales and gross profit total net sales for the year ended december   decreased slightly by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in net sales of natural rubber declined by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in the decline in natural rubber sales has been partially offset by the increase in procurement of materials and supplies 
net sales revenue for the procurement of materials and supplies increased significantly by rmb million or to rmb million  compared to rmb million for the corresponding period in the natural rubber market in was not as favorable as in because of a weakened domestic rubber consumption market and a decline in the domestic natural rubber price caused by the large influx of imported natural rubber 
the quantity of natural rubber sales decreased by approximately  tons or to  tons  compared to  tons for the corresponding period in the unit price of natural rubber decreased from approximately rmb  per ton at the beginning of to approximately rmb  per ton by the end of during the third quarter of the year  the company deliberately stockpiled natural rubber in anticipation of an upward price movement during the fourth quarter  when output is generally lower 
however  the domestic price of natural rubber continued to be low during the fourth quarter because of the large influx of imported rubber during the fourth quarter 
following the completion of the company s private offshore placements on march and july   portions of the net proceeds from the offerings were invested into harc and the operating subsidiaries as working capital to expand the distribution operations 
during the year  the company has expanded into trading of other agricultural products  such as coffee beans which were in high demand in china as a result of the active trading of coffee commodity futures in china 
during the year  a quantity of approximately  tons of coffee beans were sold and a net sales revenue of approximately rmb million was recorded  which carried an average gross profit of approximately 
the corresponding sales revenue was recorded under the procurement of materials and supplies 
if sales of these agricultural products were excluded  net sales revenue from procurement of materials and supplies would drop by approximately rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in the decline was mainly due to the prolonged enforcement of the macroeconomic austerity measures implemented by the central government since mid to rein in the overheated chinese economy  which has hampered the domestic consumption and demand for materials and supplies 
gross profits increased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in the overall gross profit margin also increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to the high gross profit margin earned from the trading of agricultural products 
the gross profit margin on natural rubber distribution was down to in from on due to competition from imported natural rubber 
the company has mitigated the effect of adverse price movement for domestic rubber on the gross profit margin by entering into rubber futures contracts to hedge against the price risk associated with the holding of rubber inventory  rubber purchase commitments and anticipation of rubber purchases 
the purchase discounts received from the farms  as well as the gross profit margin guarantee  also helped to shield the company against the effect of the drop in natural rubber prices on gross profit margins 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in pursuant to the restructuring agreements effective on october   the company strategically consolidated and rationalized its various trading divisions in order to streamline its business operations and improve cost control 
the successful implementation of the corporate restructuring and cost control measures has resulted in reduced administrative overhead  staff costs and related expenses 
this reduction of administrative overhead  staff costs and related welfare expenses more than offset the increased legal and professional fees associated with regulatory compliance and public relations costs incurred as a result of the nasdaq listing status of the company 
financial expenses  net the net financial expenses decreased by rmb or to rmb million in from rmb million in the decrease in net financial expenses was primarily attributable to the reduction in bank interest expenses commencing in the fourth quarter of following the execution of the restructuring agreements effective on october  according to the restructuring agreements  all outstanding bank loans of the operating subsidiaries were deemed assigned to the farming bureau  together with the assignment of certain accounts receivable from the farms and certain affiliates of the farming bureau 
as a result  all bank interest incurred by the operating subsidiaries commencing october   was borne by the farming bureau 
other income  net other income decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in this significant reduction in other income was primarily due to the reduction in profit from the trading of commodity futures contracts for non hedging purposes 
a profit on the trading of commodity futures of rmb million was recorded for the year  compared to a profit of only rmb million for the year in addition  a service fee of rmb million was paid to the farming bureau in accordance with the agreement on service and cooperation entered into between the farming bureau and harc dated november  the agreement stipulates that the farming bureau is entitled to a service fee up to a maximum of rmb million  calculated at a rate of of harc s annual net income before the service fee  as determined in accordance with us gaap  provided that the annual net income of harc exceeds rmb million after deducting such fee 
no service fee was paid to the farming bureau in because the financial criteria for such payment was not met 
liquidity and capital resources the operating subsidiaries primary liquidity needs are to fund accounts receivable  inventories and  to a lesser extent  to expand business operations 
the operating subsidiaries have financed their working capital requirements through the internally generated cash 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was rmb million  rmb million and rmb million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash flows from the operating subsidiaries operating activities are attributable to the operating subsidiaries income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the substantial increase in cash used in operating activities in was mainly due to the increase in purchase deposits paid to hainan state farms and to the increase in inventory held at the year end in anticipation of a higher selling price for natural rubber during the non harvest season in early effective from january   the operating subsidiaries were no longer require to pay deposits on purchases from hainan state farms 
the operating subsidiaries do not have outstanding bank loans as at december  the outstanding short term bank loans as at december  were assumed by the farming bureau upon the approval of such banks on march  and march  according to the restructuring agreements  the farming bureau was responsible for the payment of interest incurred on the bank loans after september  the farming bureau has guaranteed the recoverability of current accounts receivable from the hainan state farms and other related companies controlled and owned by the farming bureau 
the company believes that the internally generated funds will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated working capital needs for at least the next months 
inflation as a measure to control inflation  the prc government has reinstated controls on bank credits  limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending 
this austerity plan  first announced in june  seems to have been relaxing during the first half of there is no assurance that the austerity program will be completed in the proximate future  nor any assurance that if it were terminated it might not be later reinstated 
while inflation has moderated since  with the national retail inflation rate falling to and per annum in  and for the first eight months of  respectively  there can be no assurance that inflation will not increase in the future or that further measures to combat inflation and speculative activities will not be implemented in a manner that may adversely affect the profitability of the operating subsidiaries and harc over time
