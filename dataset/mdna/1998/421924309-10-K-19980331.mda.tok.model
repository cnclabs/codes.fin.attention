the company determines the amortization period of the cost in excess of net asset value of purchased facilities based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual purchase transaction 
the evaluation includes an analysis of historic and projected financial performance  an evaluation of the estimated useful life of the buildings and fixed assets acquired  the indefinite useful life of certificates of need and licenses acquired  the competition within local markets  lease terms where applicable  and the legal terms of partnerships where applicable 
the company utilizes independent appraisers and relies on its own management expertise in evaluating each of the factors noted above 
with respect to the carrying value of the excess of cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets  the company determines on a quarterly basis whether an impairment event has occurred by considering factors such as the market value of the asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action by regulators  a history of operating losses or cash flow losses  or a projection of continuing losses associated with an operating entity 
the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  the company s carrying value of the asset will be reduced by the estimated shortfall of cash flows to the estimated fair market value 
governmental  commercial and private payors have increasingly recognized the need to contain their costs for healthcare services 
these payors  accordingly  are turning to closer monitoring of services  prior authorization requirements  utilization review and increased utilization of outpatient services 
during the periods discussed below  the company has experienced an increased effort by these payors to contain costs through negotiated discount pricing

proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to pay off all amounts under the senior bridge credit facility and reduce outstanding amounts under the credit agreement

the company intends to pursue the acquisition or development of additional healthcare operations  including outpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  ambulatory surgery centers  outpatient diagnostic centers and companies engaged in the provision of rehabilitation related services  and to expand certain of its existing facilities 
while it is not possible to estimate precisely the amounts which will actually be expended in the foregoing areas  the company anticipates that over the next twelve months  it will spend approximately  on maintenance and expansion of its existing facilities and approximately  on development of the integrated service model 
see item  business company strategy 
although the company is continually considering and evaluating acquisitions and opportunities for future growth  the company has not entered into any agreements with respect to material future acquisitions 
the company believes that existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the interim revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the company s estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  and for the reasonably foreseeable future 
in addition  the company expects to explore other opportunities within the capital markets as a result of its reduced leverage and investment grade rating 
inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on the company s business  and is not expected to adversely affect the company in the future unless it increases significantly 
exposures to market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because of its favorable borrowing arrangements and current market conditions  the company currently does not use derivatives  such as swaps or caps  to alter the interest characteristics of its debt instruments and investment securities 
the impact on earnings and value of market risk sensitive financial instruments principally marketable security investments and long term debt is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
the company uses sensitivity analysis models to evaluate these impacts 
the company s investment in marketable securities was  at december   which represents less than of total assets at that date 
these securities are generally short term  highly liquid instruments and  accordingly  their fair value approximates cost 
earnings on investments in marketable securities are not significant to the company s results of operations  and therefore any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on future pre tax earnings 
with respect to the company s interest bearing liabilities  approximately  in long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  is subject to fixed rates of interest see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further description 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt  based on discounted cash flow analyses  approximates its carrying value at december  based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately  the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change 
subsequent to december  the company issued  in principal amount of the debentures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds were used to pay down existing variable rate indebtedness  which will in effect further reduce the company s exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currency  are currently insignificant to the company s results of operations and financial position 
computer technologies and year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
the issue is whether such code exists in the company s mission critical applications and if that code will produce accurate information with relation to date sensitive calculations after the turn of the century 
the company has completed a thorough review of its material computer applications and determined that such applications contain very few date sensitive calculations 
the company s computer applications are divided into two categories  those maintained internally by the company s information technology group and those maintained externally by the applications vendors 
for internally maintained applications  revisions are currently being made and are expected to be implemented by the first quarter of the company expects that the total cost associated with these revisions will be less than  these costs will be primarily incurred during and be charged to expense as incurred 
for externally maintained systems  the company has received written confirmation from the vendors that each system is currently year compliant or will be made year compliant during the cost to be incurred by the company related to externally maintained systems is expected to be minimal 
the company has initiated a program to determine whether the computer applications of its significant payors and suppliers will be upgraded in a timely manner 
the company has not completed this review  however  initial responses indicate that no significant problems are currently expected to arise 
the company has also initiated a program to determine whether embedded applications which control certain medical and other equipment will be affected 
the nature of the company s business is such that any failure of these type applications is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its business 
because of the many uncertainties associated with year compliance issues  and because the company s assessment is necessarily based on information from third party vendors  payors and suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment is correct or as to the materiality or effect of any failure of such assessment to be correct 
forward looking statements statements contained in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
in addition  the company  through its senior management  from time to time makes forward looking public statements concerning its expected future operations and performance and other developments 
such forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the company s best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that other factors will not affect the accuracy of such forward looking statements 
while is impossible to identify all such factors  factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the company include  but are not limited to  changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry at either or both of the federal and state levels  changes in reimbursement for the company s services by governmental or private payors  competitive pressures in the healthcare industry and the company s response thereto  the company s ability to obtain and retain favorable arrangements with third party payors  unanticipated delays in the company s implementation of its integrated service model  general conditions in the economy and capital markets  and other factors which may be identified from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings and other public announcements
