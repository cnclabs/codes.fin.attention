overview the following table in millions of dollars summarizes the contribution to consolidated earnings by each of the company s businesses 
years ended december  business electric natural gas distribution natural gas transmission construction materials and mining oil and natural gas production earnings on common stock earnings per common share basic earnings per common share diluted return on average common equity compared to consolidated earnings for increased million when compared to this increase includes the effect of the one time adjustment in the third quarter of of million or cents per common share  reflecting the write down to market value of natural gas being held under a repurchase commitment and certain reserve adjustments 
the improvement is attributable to increased earnings from the natural gas transmission  electric and oil and natural gas production businesses  partially offset by a decrease in construction materials and mining and natural gas distribution earnings 
compared to consolidated earnings for were up million when compared to including the effect of the million net charge  previously described 
the increase was the result of higher earnings at the oil and natural gas production  natural gas distribution and construction materials and mining businesses 
decreased earnings at the electric and natural gas transmission businesses somewhat offset the earnings improvement

on july   knife river acquired the percent interest in hawaiian cement that it did not previously own  and subsequent to that date financial results are consolidated into knife river s financial statements 
oil and natural gas production operations years ended december  operating revenues oil natural gas operating expenses operation and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes  other than income operating income production s oil barrels    natural gas mcf    average sales price oil per barrel natural gas per mcf amounts presented in the above tables for natural gas operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expenses will not agree with the consolidated statements of income due to the elimination of intercompany transactions between montana dakota s natural gas distribution business and williston basin s natural gas transmission business 
the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for natural gas operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expenses were million  million and million  respectively  for  million  million and million  respectively  for  and million  million and million  respectively  for compared to electric operations operating income at the electric business increased primarily due to increased retail sales and sales for resale revenues 
retail sales revenue increased due to increased rates in wyoming reflecting recovery of costs associated with the new power supply contract with black hills power and light company beginning january  higher average realized rates in the remaining service territory and decreased net refunding due to timing of fuel costs to customers also added to the retail sales revenue improvement 
decreased weather related sales primarily to residential customers in the fourth quarter somewhat offset the increase in retail sales revenue 
sales for resale revenue increased due to higher average realized rates caused by favorable market conditions in the third and fourth quarters 
increases in utility services revenue and related increases in operation and maintenance expense  depreciation  depletion  and amortization and taxes other than income resulted from international line builders  inc and high line equipment  inc  which were acquired on july  exclusive of the above mentioned acquisitions  operation expenses decreased due to lower payroll and benefit related expenses  which also added to the operating income improvement 
increased maintenance expense partially offset the increase in operating income 
power generation maintenance expense increased due to million in costs resulting from a ten week maintenance outage at the coyote station in  this was somewhat offset by costs resulting from maintenance work at both the lewis and clark station and the big stone station 
higher transmission and distribution maintenance expense  due to the repair of damages associated with the april blizzard  also added to the increase in maintenance expense 
increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely resulting from increased purchase power demand charges and changes in generation mix  partially offset the operating income increase 
the increase in demand charges is related to the power supply contract with black hills power and light company 
earnings for the electric business improved due to the operating income increase but were slightly offset by increased interest expense due to higher average short term debt balances 
earnings attributable to the electric services companies acquired on july   were  natural gas distribution operations operating income decreased at the natural gas distribution business as a result of reduced sales of million decatherms  the result of warmer weather 
the pass through of higher average gas costs more than offset the revenue decline that resulted from the reduced sales volumes 
a general rate increase placed into effect in montana in may  which added to the revenue improvement  partially offset the operating income decline 
decreased operations expense due to lower payroll and benefit related costs also partially offset the decrease in operating income 
the effects of higher volumes transported  primarily to large industrial customers  were offset by lower average transportation rates 
natural gas distribution earnings declined largely due to the decrease in operating income 
decreased net interest expense and increased return on gas in storage and prepaid demand balances included in other income net slightly offset the earnings decline 
the decrease in net interest expense resulted from reduced carrying costs on natural gas costs refundable through rate adjustments due to lower refundable balances 
natural gas transmission operations operating income at the natural gas transmission business decreased primarily due to a decline in transportation revenues 
transportation revenues were lower due to the reversal of certain reserves for regulatory contingencies which added million million after tax to revenue in in addition  reduced recovery of deferred natural gas contract buy out buy down and gas supply realignment costs and lower average transportation rates contributed to the decrease in transportation revenue 
transportation revenues also decreased due to additional reserved revenues provided  with a corresponding reduction in depreciation expense  as a result of ferc orders relating to a general rate proceeding 
increased volumes transported to off system markets  due to sales of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment  were partially offset by lower on system transportation  somewhat reducing the transportation revenue decline 
sales of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment were mmdk  primarily volumes sold to off system markets and volumes sold in place 
taxes other than income increased due primarily to increased property and production taxes which also contributed to the operating income decline 
natural gas production revenues for  excluding the effect of intercompany eliminations of million  improved as a result of both higher volumes produced and increased prices which partially offset the decrease in operating income 
the increases in energy marketing revenue  purchased gas sold and the related increase in operation and maintenance expense resulted from prairielands becoming a wholly owned subsidiary effective january  operation expenses  excluding prairielands  decreased due to reduced amortization of deferred natural gas contract buy out buy down and gas supply realignment costs offset in part by higher royalties due to both a royalty settlement with the united states minerals management service and increased production and prices 
earnings for this business increased due to the september million million after tax write down of the natural gas available under the repurchase commitment to the then current market price 
gains realized on the sale of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment and decreased carrying costs on this gas stemming from lower average borrowings also added to the earnings increase 
increased income taxes due to the reversal of certain income tax reserves aggregating million in september and decreased operating income both partially offset the earnings improvement 
construction materials and mining operations construction materials operations construction materials operating income increased million due to higher revenues primarily resulting from the acquisitions of baldwin in april  medford ready mix  inc medford in june  orland asphalt in february  and the interest in hawaiian cement that knife river did not previously own in july revenues at other construction materials operations increased as a result of higher aggregate and ready mixed concrete sales volumes  increased construction revenues  and higher asphalt prices 
the increase in operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses was largely due to expenses associated with such acquisitions 
operation and maintenance expenses also increased at the other construction materials operations due to higher aggregate and ready mixed concrete volumes sold 
coal operations operating income for the coal operations decreased million  largely due to decreased revenues resulting from lower sales of  tons to the coyote station  the result of the ten week maintenance outage 
higher average sales prices at the beulah mine partially offset the reduced coal revenues 
increased operation and maintenance expense due to higher stripping costs at the beulah mine  partially offset by lower volume related costs and decreased taxes other than income  also added to the operating income decline 
consolidated earnings declined due to decreased operating income at the coal business and decreased other income net 
the decrease in other income net was due to the purchase of the interest in hawaiian cement that knife river did not previously own 
prior to august  knife river s original percent ownership interest in hawaiian cement was accounted for under the equity method 
however  on july   knife river acquired the percent interest in hawaiian cement that it did not previously own and knife river in august began consolidating hawaiian cement into its financial statements 
in addition  higher interest expense resulting mainly from increased long term debt due to the aforementioned acquisitions also added to the decrease in earnings 
increased construction materials operating income and gains realized from the sale of equipment  partially offset the earnings decline 
oil and natural gas production operations operating income for the oil and natural gas production business at fidelity oil increased slightly as a result of higher natural gas revenues 
the increase in natural gas revenue resulted from a million improvement due to higher average prices somewhat offset by a million decrease due to lower production 
decreased oil revenue largely offset the natural gas revenue increase 
the decline in oil revenue was due to a million decrease resulting from lower average oil prices and a million decline due to lower production 
decreased depreciation  depletion and amortization  largely the result of lower production  also added to the increase in operating income 
increased taxes other than income partially offset the increase in operating income 
earnings for this business unit increased due to the operating income improvement and decreased interest expense due to lower average long term debt balances 
increased income taxes somewhat offset the earnings improvement 
the increase in income taxes resulted from the reversal of certain tax reserves aggregating million in september somewhat offset by higher tax credits in compared to electric operations operating income at the electric business decreased primarily due to increased fuel and purchased power costs  resulting primarily from both higher purchased power demand charges and increased net sales 
the increase in demand charges  related to a participation power contract  was the result of the pass through of periodic maintenance costs as well as the purchase of an additional five megawatts of capacity beginning in may  which brought the total level of capacity available under this contract to megawatts 
also contributing to the operating income decline were higher operation expenses  primarily resulting from higher transmission and payroll related costs due to establishing certain contingency reserves  and higher depreciation expense  due to an increase in average depreciable plant 
increased revenues  primarily higher retail sales due to increased weather related demand from residential and commercial customers in the first and fourth quarters of  largely offset the operating income decline 
lower sales for resale volumes due to line capacity restrictions within the regional power pool were more than offset by higher average realized rates also partially offsetting the operating revenue increase 
earnings for the electric business decreased due to the operating income decline  and decreased service and repair income and lower investment income  both included in other income net 
natural gas distribution operations operating income at the natural gas distribution business improved largely as a result of increased sales revenue 
the sales revenue improvement resulted primarily from a million decatherm increase in volumes sold due to colder weather and increased sales resulting from the addition of over  customers 
also contributing to the sales revenue improvement were the effects of a general rate increase placed into effect in montana in may however  the pass through of lower average natural gas costs partially offset the sales revenue improvement 
decreased operations expense due to lower payroll related costs also added to the operating income improvement 
lower transportation revenues  primarily decreased volumes transported to large industrial customers  somewhat offset the operating income improvement 
industrial transportation declined due to lower volumes transported to two agricultural processing facilities  one of which closed in september  and one of which experienced lower production  and to a cement manufacturing facility due to its use of an alternate fuel 
natural gas distribution earnings increased due to the operating income improvement  decreased interest expense and higher service and repair income 
the decline in interest expense resulted from lower average long term debt and natural gas costs refundable through rate adjustment balances 
natural gas transmission operations operating income at the natural gas transmission business increased primarily due to an improvement in transportation revenues resulting from increased transportation of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment  increased volumes transported to storage and the reversal of certain reserves for regulatory contingencies of million million after tax 
the benefits derived from a favorable rate change implemented in january  also added to the revenue improvement 
the nonrecurring effect of a favorable ferc order received in april  on a rehearing request relating to a general rate proceeding partially offset the transportation revenue improvement 
the order allowed for the one time billing of customers for approximately million million after tax to recover a portion of the amount previously refunded in july in addition  reduced recovery of deferred natural gas contract buy out buy down and gas supply realignment costs partially offset the increase in transportation revenue 
an increase in natural gas production revenue  due to both higher volumes and prices  also contributed to the operating income improvement 
decreased storage revenues  due primarily to the implementation of lower rates in january  partially offset the increase in operating income 
operation expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll related costs and production royalties but were slightly offset by reduced amortization of deferred natural gas contract buy out buy down costs 
earnings for this business decreased due to the write down to the then current market price of the natural gas available under the repurchase commitment 
the effect of the write down  which was million  or million after tax  was significantly offset by the reversal of certain income tax reserves aggregating million 
decreased interest income  largely related to  after tax of interest on the previously discussed refund recovery combined with higher company production refunds both included in other income net  also added to the earnings decline 
increased net interest expense  after tax  largely resulting from higher average reserved revenue balances partially offset by decreased long term debt expense due to lower average borrowings  further reduced earnings 
the earnings decrease was somewhat offset by the increase in operating income 
construction materials and mining operations construction materials operations construction materials operating income increased million due to higher revenues 
the revenue improvement is largely due to revenues realized as a result of the baldwin and medford acquisitions 
revenues at most other construction materials operations decreased as a result of lower aggregate and asphalt sales due to lower demand  and lower construction sales due to the nature of work being performed this year as compared to last year  offset in part by increased building materials sales and aggregate and ready mixed concrete prices 
operation and maintenance expenses increased due to the above acquisitions but were somewhat offset by a reduction at other construction materials operations resulting from lower volumes sold and less work involving the use of subcontractors 
coal operations operating income for coal operations decreased million primarily due to decreased revenues  largely the result of the expiration of the coal contract with the big stone station in august  and the resulting closure of the gascoyne mine 
higher average sales prices due to price increases at the beulah mine partially offset the decreased coal revenues 
decreased operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation expense and taxes other than income  largely due to the mine closure  partially offset the decline in operating income 
consolidated earnings increased due to the increase in construction materials operating income and income from a percent interest in hawaiian cement acquired in september of million as compared to million in included in other income net 
higher interest expense million after tax  resulting mainly from increased long term debt due to the acquisition of hawaiian cement  baldwin and medford  and the decline in coal operating income somewhat offset the increase in earnings 
oil and natural gas production operations operating income for the oil and natural gas production business increased primarily as a result of higher oil and natural gas revenues 
higher oil revenue resulted from a million increase due to higher average prices and a million increase due to improved production 
the increase in natural gas revenue was due to a million increase arising from higher prices and a million improvement resulting from higher production 
increased operation and maintenance expenses  largely due to higher production  and higher taxes other than income  primarily the result of higher prices  both partially offset the operating income improvement 
also reducing operating income was increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense resulting from increased average rates and higher production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization rates increased in part due to the accrual of estimated future well abandonment costs  after tax 
earnings for this business unit increased due to the operating income improvement and lower income taxes due to the reversal of certain tax reserves aggregating million 
increased interest expense  after tax  resulting mainly from higher average borrowings  and lower tax benefits somewhat offset the earnings improvement
