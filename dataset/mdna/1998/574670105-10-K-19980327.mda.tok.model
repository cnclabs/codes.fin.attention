item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
corporate development recent developments in january  the company completed the acquisition of trimas corporation trimas by purchasing all the outstanding shares of trimas not already owned by the company for approximately million 
trimas is a diversified proprietary products company with leadership product positions in commercial  industrial and consumer markets and had sales in excess of million 
the company previously owned percent of trimas 
the combined companies have sales on a pro forma basis of approximately billion for for some time  mascotech s key strategic objectives have included the expansion of its advanced metalworking capabilities into additional transportation related and other markets  and the creation of more value for its shareholders from its affiliate investments 
the acquisition of trimas by mascotech is consistent with these objectives 
mascotech s advanced metalworking products are sold to transportation related markets  primarily for automotive light vehicle applications 
a substantial portion of trimas diversified industrial products are manufactured with metalworking technologies that are complementary to mascotech s advanced metalworking capabilities 
in addition  approximately percent of trimas products are sold to transportation related markets including off road vehicle  and aerospace  and for towing systems and accessory products  automotive light vehicle non oem  recreational vehicle  and marine markets 
the acquisition of trimas significantly increases mascotech s sales to transportation related markets and to other commercial and industrial markets while at the same time reduces the dependence of mascotech s operating results on the automotive industry  which has historically been more cyclical 
mascotech also believes that the acquisition of trimas provides opportunities to expand sales of certain of its products to trimas customers and to expand sales of certain of trimas products to mascotech s customers 
in addition  the acquisition permits mascotech and trimas to share research  technology and expertise to the benefit of both companies 
mascotech reviews on an ongoing basis its various affiliate investments with the objective of maximizing the value of these investments for its stockholders 
in analyzing its alternatives related to its investment in trimas  mascotech concluded that maintaining its current level of investment in trimas was not an attractive alternative since mascotech s ownership of approximately percent of the trimas shares resulted in the inclusion in mascotech s after tax earnings of percent of trimas after tax earnings  but with additional taxes on those earnings also accrued by mascotech 
in addition  trimas dividend distributions to mascotech represented substantially less than percent of trimas cash flow 
mascotech also considered the alternatives of a third party sale of its shares or the distribution to mascotech s shareholders of its shares to be unattractive since either transaction would have resulted in a tax to mascotech in excess of million valuing mascotech s equity interest in trimas for this purpose at per share which equals the acquisition price per share 
in addition to the expansion of its metalworking capabilities into complementary markets  and the avoidance of a substantial tax that would result from the sale or distribution of trimas holdings  the acquisition of trimas by mascotech adds high margin complementary businesses that provide substantial additional cash flow and human resources 
mascotech believes that the acquisition should enhance its opportunity to create value for its shareholders by diversifying its business mix  by improving its cost efficiencies  and by expanding its growth opportunities 
share repurchase the company s major shareholder  masco corporation  had a long standing stated objective to simplify its corporate structure by reducing its affiliate investments 
more recently  masco corporation had committed to its shareholders that masco corporation would reduce its investment in mascotech to below percent 
given the possible alternatives available to masco corporation to accomplish this objective and the related uncertainty as to what action masco corporation might take  together with the positive long term outlook for mascotech  the mascotech board of directors decided to address this issue by proactively pursuing the purchase of masco corporation s holdings in mascotech 
the mascotech board of directors believed that purchasing and retiring a substantial number of mascotech shares at a reasonable price would help create long term value for the company s shareholders 
as a result  in late  the company purchased from masco corporation million shares of mascotech common stock and warrants to acquire million shares of mascotech common stock  for approximately million 
as part of this transaction  and given his role as chairman of both masco corporation and mascotech  richard manoogian also agreed to sell to mascotech one million shares of mascotech common stock at the then current market price of as a result  his seven percent ownership in mascotech common stock remained approximately the same after the share purchases 
at december   masco corporation owned approximately percent of the mascotech common stock outstanding 
disposition of businesses in late  the company adopted a plan to dispose  by sale or liquidation  a number of businesses  including its architectural products  defense and certain of its transportation related products and services businesses  as part of its long term strategic plan to increase the focus on its proprietary metalworking capabilities 
the disposition of these businesses did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations treatment for accounting purposes  accordingly  the sales and results of operations of these businesses are included in continuing operations until disposition 
the company s carrying value of a number of the businesses disposed exceeded the estimated proceeds expected from such dispositions 
to reflect the estimated loss on the disposition of these businesses  the company recorded a non cash charge in aggregating million pre tax for those businesses for which a loss was anticipated 
in may  the company sold mascotech stamping technologies  inc msti  a wholly owned subsidiary  to tower automotive  inc tower resulting in an after tax loss of approximately million 
per common share 
the company received initial consideration of approximately million  consisting principally of million in cash   shares of tower common stock and warrants to purchase additional tower common stock 
the company applied the cash proceeds including approximately million received from the subsequent sale of  shares of tower common stock to reduce its indebtedness 
the company may receive additional consideration  of which approximately million was earned in  contingent upon the future earnings of msti through may  in early  the company completed the sale of its technical services group tsg  comprised of the company s engineering and technical business services units to msx international  inc also included in this transaction were the net assets of apx international apx which were acquired by the company in november the sale resulted in total proceeds to the company of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  consisting of cash  subordinated debentures  preferred stock and an approximate percent common equity interest in msx international  inc net proceeds to the company approximated million  after taking into account the purchase price for apx and taxes payable in connection with this transaction

businesses sold had sales of  million and million in  and  respectively  and operating income losses before gains charge on disposition of businesses  net of  million and million in  and  respectively 
profit margins operating profit margins  excluding net gains in and  and net charges in  from the disposition of businesses  were approximately ten percent in  eight percent in and six percent in the increase in the operating profit margin in compared with the previous two years is attributable to the disposition of businesses which had margins lower than the company s remaining operations 
cash flows and capital expenditures net cash flows from operating activities decreased to million in from million in in  net cash from operating activities included approximately million in refundable income taxes 
reflecting the favorable long term prospects for mascotech  the company s board of directors authorized in the repurchase of million shares of company common stock and convertible preferred stock converted into common stock in 
pursuant to this authorization  the company has repurchased and retired approximately million shares of company common stock and 
million shares of convertible preferred stock since at a cost of approximately million 
in addition  in october  the company purchased and retired million shares of company common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of company common stock for cash and notes approximating million see corporate development above and shareholders equity note to the financial statements 
the company in increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock to

capital expenditures in were approximately million as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
during  the company made significant expenditures in capital programs to support the company s metalworking and aftermarket businesses 
these expenditures for new advanced manufacturing technologies  product line extensions and capacity for new products were the result of the company s favorable long term outlook for these businesses and to meet increased demand for certain product programs 
inventories the company s investment in inventories for its businesses increased modestly to approximately million at december  as compared with million in the company s continued emphasis on inventory management  utilizing just in time and other inventory management techniques  has contributed to higher inventory turnover rates in recent years 
financial position and liquidity in connection with the trimas acquisition in january  the company entered into a new billion credit facility 
on a pro forma basis at december  including the borrowings for the trimas acquisition  debt as a percent of total debt plus equity would be approximately percent 
the company s new credit facility includes a million term loan and an million revolver  both of which terminate in the interest rates applicable to the new credit facility are principally at alternative floating rates which would have approximated percent at december  the new credit facility requires the maintenance of a specified level of shareholders equity plus subordinated debt  with limitations on the ratios of total debt to cash flow as defined and cash flow less capital expenditures as defined to interest plus scheduled debt payments 
in addition  there are limitations on dividends  share repurchases and subordinated debt repurchases 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  approximately million would have been available at december  for the payment of cash dividends and the acquisition of company capital stock 
in addition  future cash dividends and any acquisition of company common stock could be further accomplished with internal cash flows from operations 
although the company incurred increased debt with the purchase of trimas  the company s interest coverage ratio and debt to cash flow ratio remain strong 
the company expects that its ratio of debt to total debt plus equity will improve from the operating performance of its businesses and from the disposition of certain financial assets 
the company s financial assets include equity ownership positions in two additional publicly traded companies with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million 
this compares with an aggregate quoted market value at december  which may differ from the amounts that could have been realized upon disposition of approximately million 
on september   the company exercised its option and exchanged its equity holdings in emco limited and approximately million in cash to masco corporation to satisfy the indebtedness to masco incurred in in connection with the company s purchase and retirement of certain of its common shares and warrants held by masco 
at december  current assets  which aggregated approximately million  were approximately two times current liabilities 
additional borrowings available under the company s new revolving credit agreement and otherwise  anticipated internal cash flows  and to the extent necessary  future financings in the financial markets are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to fund the company s foreseeable working capital  capital expansion programs and other investment needs 
other matters the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information and other systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  the failure to do so could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company is devoting the resources believed to be necessary to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner
