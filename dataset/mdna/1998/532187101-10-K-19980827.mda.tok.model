growth in the hyaluronate division is unpredictable due to the complex governmental regulatory environment for new medical products and the early stage of certain of these markets 
similarly  expansion of the company s oral restorative division sales is also dependent upon increased revenue from new and existing customers  as well as successfully competing in a more mature market 
with the completion of the facility expansion  the company expects its cash generated from anticipated operations and the availability of the line of credit to satisfy cash flow needs in the near term 
no assurance can be given that the company will attain and maintain positive cash flow before its capital resources are exhausted 
while the company s capital resources appear adequate today  unforeseen events  prior to achieving and maintaining positive cash flow  could require additional financing 
if additional financing is necessary  no assurance can be given that such financing will be available and  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company and its shareholders
