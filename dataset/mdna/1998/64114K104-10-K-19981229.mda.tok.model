the company s products include nvo software which is a no assembly required web site solution that allows internet users to create their own customized  interactive web site  netopia internet routers  which offer a range of high speed  multi user digital and analog internet connectivity solutions  and timbuktu pro real time communication and remote control software for workgroups  remote workers and help desk administrators 
in  the company focused its business strategy to concentrate on the internet and intranet markets through the utilization of its tcp ip and routing expertise 
in fiscal  the company released its timbuktu pro internet intranet collaboration software product tcp ip enabled 
in fiscal  the company introduced its netopia internet router products and services  and  in fiscal  the company introduced its nvo software platform 
during fiscal  the company expanded its internet product offerings by releasing the hosted version of nvo and by offering additional internet routers supporting dsl and k dual analog technologies 
the company also expanded its strategic internet relationships in fiscal by partnering with netscape  france telecom  copper mountain and northpoint communications 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold its lan division which developed and sold lan products primarily for apple macintosh computers 
the company s total revenues from continuing operations are derived from the sale of hardware and software products and include license revenues for its timbuktu pro and nvo software  sales of its netopia internet router products and fees for related services  as well as revenue from licensing the company s patent covering cross platform screen sharing technology 
revenue relating to the sale and licensing of hardware and software products is recognized upon shipment of the products by the company  patent revenue is recognized upon the licensing of the rights to the patent and service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
certain of the company s sales are made to customers under agreements permitting limited rights of return for stock balancing or with protection for future price decreases 
revenue is recorded net of an estimated allowance for returns 
any product returns or price decreases in the future that exceed the company s allowances may materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company has experienced revenue growth over the last five years  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase revenue growth rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
as a result of the sale of the lan division  the company s consolidated statements of operations have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the operations associated with the company s lan division 
the company s limited operating history without its lan division and the dynamic market environment in which the company competes make the prediction of future operating results difficult  if not impossible 
the company sells its products and related maintenance  support and other services through distributors  isps  vars and directly by the company to corporate accounts  higher education institutions and over the internet 
the company s revenues from distributors accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company s three largest distributors  in aggregate  accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  revenue from ingram accounted for  and of the company s total revenues  respectively 
no other customers have accounted for or more of the company s total revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and the distribution of products such as those offered by the company has been characterized by rapid change  including industry consolidations  financial difficulties of distributors and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
there can be no assurance that current distributors will continue to serve as distributors for the company since the company does not currently have a written agreement regarding price or quantity commitments with these or other distributors which operate on a purchase order basis 
the lan division historically sold significant volumes of product through the company s distributors 
due to the sale of the lan division there can be no assurance that the company s current distributors will continue to market the company s products or that the company s channel expense levels will not increase 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenue from any one of the company s distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s distributors generally offer products of several different companies  including products that are competitive with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that future sales by the company s distributors will continue at current levels  that the company will be able to retain its current distributors in the future on terms which are acceptable to the company  that the company s current distributors will choose to or be able to market the company s products effectively  that economic conditions or industry demand will not adversely affect these or other distributors  that these distributors will not devote greater resources to marketing products of other companies or that internal staffing changes or other changes at the company s distributors will not disrupt historical purchasing or payment patterns 
accordingly  the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenue from  one of the company s distributors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company grants to its distributors limited rights to return unsold inventories of the company s products in exchange for new purchases and provides price protection to its distributors 
although the company provides allowances for projected returns and price decreases  any product returns or price decreases in the future that exceed the company s allowances will materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company also provides end users with a ninety day and one year limited warranty on its timbuktu pro and internet connectivity products  respectively  and permits end users to return the product for replacement or its full purchase price if the product does not perform as warranted 
the nvo service is provided on an as is basis  therefore the company does not generally offer a warranty on its nvo service 
end users are offered a free thirty day evaluation period to use and evaluate the service prior to purchase and thereafter can discontinue their subscription at any time 
to date  the company has not encountered material warranty claims 
nevertheless  if future warranty claims exceed the company s reserves  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company attempts to further limit its liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions in its end user warranty 
however  no assurance can be given that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
international revenues accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the following table provides a breakdown of revenue by region expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented fiscal years ended september  europe pacific rim other subtotal international revenues united states total revenues the company s international revenues are currently denominated in united states dollars  and revenues generated by the company s distributors currently are paid to the company in united states dollars 
the results of the company s international operations may fluctuate from period to period based on global economic factors including  but not limited to  the current economic situation in asia and japan and movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in exchange rates have not materially affected the company s total revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that movements in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues in the future 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues 
any significant decline in international demand for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that in order to increase sales opportunities and profitability it will be required to expand its international operations 
the company has committed and continues to commit significant management attention and financial resources to developing international sales and support channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
to the extent that the company is unable to maintain or increase international demand for its products  the company s international sales will be limited  and the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s international operations are subject to inherent risks  including  but not limited to  the impact of current and potential future recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences and political and economic instability 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia such as the people s republic of china  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus may make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase international revenues  or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international revenues and its business  operating results and financial condition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold its lan division through which it had developed and sold lan products primarily for apple macintosh computers 
the lan division s operations  products and the market in which it competed were no longer considered core to the company s business strategy 
as a result  the company sold the lan division s products  accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  intellectual property and other related assets  to farallon communications  inc farallon  formerly known as farallon networking corporation  a delaware corporation and an affiliate of gores technology group gores 
farallon also assumed certain accounts payable and other liabilities of the lan division 
the lan division s products consisted of ethernet  etherwave  fast ethernet and localtalk compatible products which included the phonenet system of network connectivity products the lan products 
in connection with such sale  the company received consideration aggregating million  including i million of cash  ii royalties on farallon s revenues for a period of five years to the extent that farallon achieves revenues from the sale of its lan products of at least million per year  iii a two year million promissory note from farallon  guaranteed by gores  and iv a warrant to purchase up to of the equity of farallon 
there can be no assurance that the business of farallon will be sufficiently successful to allow the company to realize the value of the receivables  note and warrant described in ii  iii and iv above 
the failure of the company to realize the value of the receivables  note and warrant could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
also in connection with the sale of the lan division  the company made certain representations and warranties about the assets and liabilities transferred to farallon 
while the company believes such representations have been accurate  the company could be liable for up to million for any damages to farallon resulting from any breach or breaches of any of such representations and warranties 
as a result  any material breach or breaches of the representations and warranties made in connection with the sale of the lan division could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see other risks associated with the sale of the lan division 
events occurring after september  on december   the company signed a definitive agreement and closed a transaction to purchase serus llc serus  a utah limited liability company 
serus is a developer of java based web site editing software products 
upon completion of the development of such products  netopia intends to market the products both independently and along with its netopia virtual office software platform to allow users more flexibility in customizing their web sites 
as per the serus asset purchase agreement by and among netopia  inc and serus llc the purchase agreement  netopia will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of serus and existing operations which include in process research and development 
the maximum aggregate purchase price of the serus transaction is approximately million including i million of cash due and payable on the closing date of the transaction  ii  shares of the company s common stock issued on the closing date  and iii a million earnout opportunity based upon certain criteria as set forth in the purchase agreement 
the company is in the process of completing the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with its acquisition of serus including the evaluation of in process research and development costs 
the company expects to record a charge to operations during the months ended december  for in process research and development relating to this recently completed acquisition 
the amount of such charge is not presently determinable  but could be material 
the company is aware that the sec is reviewing the assumptions and methodologies heretofore commonly used by companies in calculating such charges 
the company intends to follow recent guidance disseminated by the sec in its valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and  in particular  in the valuation of in process research and development 
in the course of integrating serus into the operations of the company  it is possible that facts or circumstances may be discovered that were not known nor apparent prior to the time that the company executed the serus purchase agreement or during its financial and technical due diligence reviews of serus 
there can be no assurance that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating the operations of serus  or that the specific benefits expected from the integration of serus will be achieved 
the acquisition of serus also involves a number of other risks  including technical risks related to the completion of on going development efforts  assimilation of new operations and personnel  the diversion of resources from netopia s existing business  integration of their respective equipment  product and service offerings  networks and technologies  financial and information systems and brand names  coordination of geographically separated facilities and work forces  management challenges associated with the integration of the companies  coordination of their respective engineering  selling  marketing and service efforts  assimilation of new management personnel  and maintenance of standards  controls  procedures and policies 
the process of integrating the serus operations  including its personnel  could cause interruption of  or loss in momentum in the activities of netopia s business and operations  including those of the business acquired 
further  employees of serus who may be key to the integration effort or netopia s ongoing operations may choose not to continue to work for netopia following the closing of the acquisition 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented fiscal years ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of taxes loss on sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss fiscal years ended september   and revenues 
total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of the windows version of timbuktu pro collaboration software  particularly volume site licenses  increased sales of the netopia isdn internet router internationally primarily as a result of the company s relationship with the france telecom wanadoo service wanadoo and increased sales of the netopia frame relay internet router in north america which was not available during the entire fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of the macos version of timbuktu pro collaboration software and price competition related to the netopia isdn internet router in north america 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of the netopia isdn internet router internationally  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fiscal first quarter introduction of the pots enabled isdn internet router in north america  a greater number of regional isps selling netopia internet routers and increased sales of the windows version of timbuktu pro 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of the macos version of timbuktu pro  decreased revenue from patent licenses and price competition related to netopia isdn internet routers in north america 
during fiscal years and  revenues from the macos version of timbuktu pro have been adversely affected by declining sales of macos computers  apple computer s loss of market share and the reduction in sales of macintosh clone computers due to the elimination of a number of cloning licenses issued by apple computer 
also during fiscal years and  the company s internet router products  particularly its netopia isdn internet router  have experienced increasing price competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers of similar products as well as competition from newer technologies such as dsl and cable internet router products 
in fiscal  the company expects revenue from the macos version of timbuktu pro to continue to decline in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue and expects continued price competition related to its internet router products 
international revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased sales of the company s netopia internet routers  particularly the netopia isdn internet router as a result of the wanadoo service 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of the netopia isdn internet router  which was introduced internationally in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin 
the company s total gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which decreased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the write down of the company s single user isdn modem inventory which totaled approximately  the write down of the company s single user isdn modem inventory reflects a shift in the company s strategic focus to providing multi user internet connectivity products rather than single user internet connectivity products 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of the company s netopia internet router products which have a lower gross margin than the company s software products and decreased revenue from patent licenses 
the company s gross margin has varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future depending primarily on the mix of products sold by the company  pricing strategies  royalties paid to third parties  standard cost changes  new versions of existing products and external market factors including but not limited to price competition 
the company s timbuktu pro and nvo collaboration software products have a higher average gross margin than the balance of the company s products 
accordingly  to the extent the product mix for any particular quarter includes a substantial proportion of lower margin products  there will be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  which decreased from million in fiscal although research and development expenses remained unchanged between fiscal and fiscal  third party contractor expenses increased but were offset by reduced product localization expenses 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreased product design  prototyping and regulatory compliance related expenses as well as reduced incentives  recruiting  travel and contractor expenses partially offset by increased product localization expenses 
research and development expenses represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company believes that it will continue to devote substantial resources to product and technological development and that research and development costs may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal historically  the company has believed its process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and no internal software costs have been capitalized to date 
during the fiscal year ended september    of product development costs incurred subsequent to the delivery of a working model  under a development agreement with third parties  were capitalized 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased headcount and increased advertising  promotional and channel development expenses related to the introduction of new products including the hosted version of nvo and the netopia dual analog and sdsl routers 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses 
selling and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company believes that selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of increased advertising and promotion campaigns as well as expansion of its telesales staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the accrual of additional bad debt expense reserves and increased facility related costs  partially offset by decreased use of information systems contractors 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased legal  accounting and insurance fees related to being a public company partially offset by reduced consulting and employee related expenses 
general and administrative expenses represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
other income  net 
other income  net  primarily represents interest earned by the company on its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the company moving its short term investments to non tax advantaged investments from tax advantaged investments 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the interest earned on cash raised from the company s june initial public offering ipo which was invested during the entire fiscal year of provision for income taxes 
income tax expense related to continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to income tax benefits of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
tax expense in fiscal was primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets as of the beginning of the year and an additional valuation allowance of million primarily against net operating losses generated in the current year 
the tax benefit recorded in fiscal was primarily related to the company s net operating loss in such year and the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily related to the company s net operating loss in such year and the reversal of a previously recognized valuation allowance 
excluding the impact of changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research tax credits and tax exempt interest income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   the company believed that based upon available objective evidence  there was sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of its tax assets to warrant a full valuation allowance 
the factors considered included the relative shorter life cycles in the high technology industry and the uncertainty of longer term taxable income estimates related thereto and as a result of the sale of the historically profitable lan division 
at september   the company believed that based upon the then available objective evidence  there was sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of certain of its tax assets to warrant a partial valuation allowance  primarily related to the expected realizability of its research credit carryforwards 
the factors considered included the relative shorter product life cycles in the high technology industry and the uncertainty of longer term taxable income estimates related thereto and limits on the carryback potential for realizing deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  the company reversed a full valuation allowance that it had previously provided against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately million 
during fiscal  the company believed that due to the demonstrated market acceptance of its new internet intranet products  the uncertainty regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets had diminished to the point where it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
discontinued operations 
on august   the company sold its lan division for consideration aggregating million  including i million of cash  ii royalties on farallon s revenues for a period of five years to the extent that farallon achieves revenues from the sale of its lan products of at least million per year  iii a two year million promissory note from farallon  guaranteed by gores  and iv a warrant to purchase up to of the equity of farallon 
the sale of the lan division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the lan division 
income from discontinued operations of  million and million in fiscal years ended september   and  respectively  represents the operating income  net of taxes of the discontinued operations 
the net book value of the lan division approximated the fair value of the consideration received  accordingly  the loss on sale of discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year ended september   primarily represents costs and transaction expenses incurred and accrued as a result of the sale of the lan division 
such expenses are directly attributable to the sale transaction and are primarily related to projected costs of abandoned facilities  investment advisory  legal and accounting fees and certain expenses related to employees of the lan division 
other factors that may affect future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report  and the risks discussed in the company s other united states securities and exchange commission filings 
fluctuations in quarterly results  future operating results uncertain 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
historically  the company had been dependent upon the sales of its lan products 
as a result of the sale of the lan division  the company s future operating results are dependent upon the market acceptance of its internet intranet products and enhancements thereto 
to the extent that the loss of revenue from the sale of the lan division and its products is not offset by increases in revenue from the sale of the company s internet intranet products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
historically  the company s continuing operations have not achieved profitability and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability in the future 
the company s operating results depend on factors such as changes in networking and communications technologies  price and product competition  usage of the internet and developments and changes in the internet market  the demand for the company s products  retention and growth of the company s nvo subscriber base  product enhancements and new product announcements by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products of the company or its competitors  the size and timing of customer orders and purchasing cycles  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements to the company s or competitors products  customer order deferrals for budgetary or other reasons  manufacturing delays  disruptions in sources of supply  product life cycles  product quality problems  changes in the level of operating expenses  the timing of research and development expenditures and the level of the company s international revenues 
the company s results also depend on the demand for vendor products related to the company s products such as windows or apple macintosh personal computers and operating systems  among others  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product offerings by these vendors 
the company s gross margins and operating results depend on factors such as raw material costs  write offs of obsolete inventory  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  including the grant of price protection terms and discounts by the company  changes in the mix of products sold by the company and the resulting change in total gross margin  changes in the mix of channels through which the company s products are offered as well as the structure of planned nvo partnerships which may be reported as either higher margin royalty arrangements or lower margin operations subject to royalty  amortization or other costs 
additionally  the company s operating results depend on general factors such as personnel changes  changes in the company s strategy  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  general economic conditions  both in the united states and abroad  and economic conditions specific to the industries in which the company competes  among others 
the company s limited internet intranet operating history and the dynamic market environment in which the company competes make the prediction of future operating results difficult  if not impossible 
sales orders are typically shipped shortly after receipt and  consequently  order backlog at the beginning of any quarter has in the past represented only a small portion of that quarter s revenues 
accordingly  the company s net revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
historically  the company has often shipped and recognized a significant portion of its revenues in the last weeks  or even days  of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or after the close of a particular quarter 
the company typically experiences significant volumes of shipments at the end of the quarter which may be exposed to delays caused by shipping halts or other factors beyond the company s control 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue on products sold through distributors  isps and vars upon shipment to the distributor  isp and var 
although the company maintains reserves for projected returns and price decreases  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate 
the company s business also has experienced seasonality in the past  largely due to customer buying patterns  such as budgeting cycles of educational institutions that purchase the company s products and the summer slowdown in most european markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s operating results will not be affected by seasonality in the future or that such seasonality will occur in a manner consistent with prior periods 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on expectations as to future revenues and  as a result  are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  net income or loss is likely to be disproportionately affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and other factors discussed herein  revenues and net income or loss for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company s business strategies will be successful or that the company will be able to return to or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with potential acquisitions or divestitures 
the company may acquire or invest in companies  technologies or products that complement the company s business or its product offerings 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate the performance of all its products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current technologies  products or product lines 
any acquisitions or divestitures may result in the use of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the write off of software development costs or other assets  incurrance of severance liabilities  the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or the incurrance of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
acquisitions or divestitures would involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in the assimilation or separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of the company s business  the entry into markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience  the potential loss of key employees and the potential loss of key distributor or supplier relationships 
in addition  potential acquisition candidates targeted by the company may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information or any degree of internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to any successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including with respect to revenues  expenses  liabilities  contingent or otherwise  and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of changing business 
managing the company s business following the sale of the lan division represents a significant challenge for the company and its administrative  operational and financial resources and places increased demands on its systems and controls 
the company s ability to manage the continuing development of its internet intranet business will require the company to continue to change  expand and improve its operational  management and financial systems and controls and to modify its manufacturing capabilities 
this transition has resulted in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company anticipates that any growth in its internet intranet business will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  sales and marketing  customer service  administrative and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining these personnel  if needed 
in addition  certain aspects of the company s internet intranet business require volume sales to achieve profitability 
if the company is unable to achieve such volumes  offset the loss of revenue or to manage the transition effectively  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
other risks associated with the sale of the lan division 
in connection with the sale of the lan division  the company received consideration aggregating million  including i million of cash  ii royalties on farallon s revenues for a period of five years to the extent that farallon achieves revenues from the sale of its lan products of at least million per year  iii a two year million promissory note from farallon  guaranteed by gores  and iv a warrant to purchase up to of the equity of farallon 
pursuant to the agreement of purchase and sale of assets  dated august  the purchase agreement  by and between the registrant and farallon communications  inc  formerly known as farallon networking corporation  the purchase price of the lan division is subject to a purchase price adjustment 
such adjustment is based upon the difference between the unaudited balance sheet of the lan division as of the effective date of sale the draft balance sheet and the estimated book value of the lan division at march  on the effective date of sale  the company estimated that this difference was approximately  and accordingly recorded that amount as a liability on the company s balance sheet as of september  any adjustment to the purchase price of the lan in excess of the amount accrued for could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s successful realization of assets related to the sale of the lan division  such as the royalty and note receivable  is dependent upon the successful operation of farallon by its management team and by gores 
for example  if farallon is unable to achieve revenues from lan products of at least million per year  the company will lose its right to a portion of farallon s revenue which could have a material adverse affect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
farallon s use of its bank credit facility or incurrance of other debt related financing may require netopia to take a subordinate position to such debt 
such subordinate position  if required  could potentially decrease the likelihood of netopia receiving payments on its future receivables from farallon which would allow farallon s other debt holders to be repaid on their loans before farallon would make any payments to netopia on netopia s farallon related receivables 
failure to receive such payments would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the company made customary representations and warranties about the assets and liabilities transferred to farallon in the purchase agreement which the company believes were materially accurate but which could become the topic of future negotiation or dispute 
while the company believes such representations have been accurate  the company could be liable for up to million for any damages to farallon resulting from any breach or breaches of any such representation and warranties 
these or other aspects of the transaction would have a material adverse affect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
tariff and regulatory matters 
the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally 
however  rates for telecommunications services are governed by tariffs of licensed carriers that are subject to regulatory approval 
future changes in these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if tariffs for public switched digital services increase in the future relative to tariffs for private leased services  then the cost effectiveness of the company s products would be reduced and its business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company s telecommunications products must meet standards and receive certification for connection to public telecommunications networks prior to their sale 
in the united states  such products must comply with part a industrial equipment  part b residential equipment and part analog and isdn lines of the federal communications commission regulations 
the company s telecommunications products also must be certified by certain domestic telecommunications carriers 
in many foreign countries  such products are subject to a wide variety of governmental review and certification requirements 
while the european economic community and certain other foreign countries regulate the importation and certification of the company s products  most foreign customers typically require that the company s products receive certification from their country s primary telecommunication carriers 
any future inability to retain  or obtain on a timely basis  domestic or foreign regulatory approvals and certifications  including safety and telecommunications  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations  and it is possible that a number of laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to such issues as user privacy  user screening to prevent inappropriate uses of the internet by  for example  minors or convicted criminals  taxation  infringement  pricing  content regulation  quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth in the use of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s products  increase the company s cost of doing business  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and developing 
any new legislation or regulation  or application or interpretation of existing laws  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  although it was held unconstitutional  the telecommunications act of prohibited the transmission over the internet of certain types of information and content 
other nations  including germany and china  have taken actions to restrict the free flow of material on the web deemed to be objectionable 
in addition  although substantial portions of the communications decency act the cda were held to be unconstitutional  there can be no assurance that similar legislation will not be enacted in the future  and it is possible that such legislation could expose the company to substantial liability 
legislation like the cda could also dampen the growth in use of the web generally and decrease the acceptance of the web as a communications and commercial medium  and could  thereby  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
it is also possible that the use of cookies to track demographic information and users may become subject to laws limiting or prohibiting their use 
a cookie is a bit of information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge 
a user is generally able to remove cookies 
germany  for example  has imposed laws limiting the use of cookies  and a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
limitations on the company s potential use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of the company s tracking user data  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  a number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet and certain states have taken measures to tax internet related activities 
moreover  it is likely that  once such moratorium is lifted  some type of federal and or state taxes will be imposed upon internet commerce  and there can be no assurance that such legislation or other attempts at regulating commerce over the internet will not substantially impair the growth of commerce on the internet and  as a result  adversely affect the company s opportunity to derive financial benefit from such activities 
in addition to the foregoing areas of recent legislative activities  several telecommunications carriers are currently seeking to have telecommunications over the web regulated by the federal communications commission the fcc in the same manner as other telecommunications services 
for example  america s carriers telecommunications association has filed a petition with the fcc for this purpose 
in addition  because the growing popularity and use of the web have burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and many areas with high web use have begun to experience interruptions in phone service  local telephone carriers have petitioned the fcc to regulate isps in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on the isps 
if either of these petitions is granted  or the relief sought therein is otherwise granted  the costs of communicating on the web could increase substantially  potentially slowing growth in use of the web  which could in turn decrease demand for the company s services or increase the company s cost of doing business 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that  although transmissions by the company over the internet originate primarily in the state of california  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or prosecute the company for violations of their laws 
there can be no assurance that violations of local laws will not be alleged or charged by state or foreign governments  that the company might not unintentionally violate such laws or that such laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  as the company s services are available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  such jurisdictions may claim that the company is required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such state or foreign country 
the failure by the company to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject the company to taxes and penalties and could result in the inability of the company to enforce contracts in such jurisdictions 
any such new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to the company s business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
liability for information retrieved from the web 
because materials may be downloaded by subscribers and other users of the company s nvo web sites and subsequently distributed to others  there is a potential that claims will be made against the company for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury or other theories based on the nature  content  publication and distribution of such materials 
such claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  in the past 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the overall growth of internet use 
the company could also be exposed to liability with respect to the offering of third party content that may be accessible through content and materials that may be posted by subscribers on their personal web sites or chat sessions 
such claims might include  among others  that by directly or indirectly hosting the personal web sites of third parties  the company is liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through such web sites 
the company also offers e mail services  which expose the company to potential risk  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail spamming  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of e mail or interruptions or delays in e mail service 
even to the extent that such claims do not result in liability to the company  the company could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against such claims 
the imposition on the company of potential liability for information carried on or disseminated through its systems could require the company to implement measures to reduce its exposure to such liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of the company s services to its subscribers which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year readiness disclosure 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the application year 
any of the company s programs or products that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year in addition  the year is a leap year  which may also lead to incorrect calculations  functions or systems failure 
as a result  within approximately one year  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
in october  the company began a millennium project to determine if any actions needed to be taken regarding date related effects to i the company s software or hardware products  ii the company s internal operating and desktop computer systems and non information technology systems  and iii the readiness of the company s third party vendors and business partners 
through testing  the company has determined that its netopia internet router products  netopia virtual office software and the versions later than of the company s windows  macos and enterprise versions of timbuktu pro  are year compliant 
although the company s products are year compliant  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  even if the company s products are year compliant  other systems or software used by the company s customers may not be year compliant 
the failure of such non compliant third party software or systems could affect the perceived performance of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s internal systems include information technology systems such as financial  order entry  inventory  shipping and customer database computer systems  desktop computer systems and non information technology systems such as telephones and facilities 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its internal information technology systems such as financial  order entry  inventory  shipping and customer database computer systems to determine if any actions need to be taken regarding year date related effects 
these underlying systems are based on a relational database language which identifies dates based on four digit numbers rather than two digit numbers and therefore the company has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for these computer systems 
the company is in the process of initiating a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of all desktop systems and expects to complete this process and upgrade such non compliant desktop systems to year compliant systems by june the additional costs of remediation are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  if implementation of replacement systems is delayed or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company is in the process of identifying and prioritizing critical third party vendors  strategic partners and suppliers of non information related products and services concerning their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
the company is also working with key suppliers of products and services to determine that their operations and products are year compliant or to monitor their progress toward year compliance  as appropriate 
to date  the company has not incurred material expenses related to its year compliance effort other than the investment of employee time and resources 
the company has currently identified certain facilities related items that the company estimates will cost approximately  to upgrade to year compliance 
while the company has dedicated and will continue to dedicate a substantial amount of time and internal resources towards attaining year compliance  there can be no assurance that the company s year compliance program will be completed on a timely basis 
in addition  there can be no assurance that there will not be an interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve the company s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  even if the company s products are year compliant  other systems or software used by the company s customers may not be year compliant 
the failure of such non compliant third party software or systems could affect the perceived performance of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the most likely worst case scenarios would include hardware failure and the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  electricity  telephone service  water transport  internet services  etc in such worst case scenario the company would lose customers and revenue which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is in the process of completing its contingency planning for high risk areas at this time and is scheduled to commence contingency planning for medium to low risk areas by june the company expects its contingency plans to include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
dependence on apple 
the company believes that approximately to of its revenues are derived from customers purchasing products for the apple macos environment 
accordingly  the company is dependent on the market for macos computers and the development and sale of new apple computers  particularly sales of such computers into business environments 
there can be no assurance that competitive personal computers will not displace the macos products or reduce sales of macos products 
sales of the company s products in the past have been adversely affected by the announcement by apple of new products with the potential to replace existing products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new macos product offerings and the elimination of a number of macintosh cloning licenses issued by apple and potential limitations on the retail distribution of apple products 
the inability of apple to successfully develop  manufacture  market or sell new products  and any decrease in the sales or market acceptance of the macos family of computers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  during fiscal and  the company believes revenues were adversely affected by declining sales of macos computers and apple s loss of market share 
in addition  sales of the company s products are dependent upon the international demand for apple products 
to the extent that the company is unable to maintain or increase international demand for its products  or that international demand for apple products does not meet the company s expectations  the company s international sales would be limited  and the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
litigation 
from time to time  the company has received claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
although the company believes that all such claims received to date are without merit or are immaterial  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or activities 
the company expects that it will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into additional royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against the company and failure or inability of the company to license the infringed or similar technology  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  the company may be involved in litigation or administrative claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business 
in the event of a successful claim against the company  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through the private sale of equity securities  the ipo of the company s common stock and  in fiscal  cash flow from operations 
since inception  the company has raised million from the private sale of equity securities and approximately million  net of offering expenses  from the company s ipo completed in june as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments representing of total assets 
included in the company s cash balances at september  was  of accounts receivable collections related to the lan division s operations which had not yet been remitted to farallon 
the company s operating activities used  of cash in fiscal  generated million of cash in fiscal and used million of cash in fiscal the cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily due to expenses related to the sale of the lan division and increased advertising and promotional expenses related to the introduction of new products 
the cash generated by operations in fiscal was primarily due to collection of accounts receivable and decreased inventory  partially offset by reductions of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable related to volume license sales of the company s software products  that occurred in the last weeks of the fourth quarter ended september   increases in operating expenses related to the introduction of netopia internet router products  reduction in accounts payable and increases in inventory related to the company s netopia internet router products and the lan division s fast ethernet products 
the company s investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments and capital equipment 
the cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was primarily from proceeds from the sale of short term investments partially offset by purchases of such investments  proceeds from the sale of the lan division  less the acquisition of a trademark license related to the netscape internet portal for nvo  which the company expects to amortize over a period not to exceed years  and expenditures for capital equipment  representing acquisitions of computer equipment used predominantly in product development 
the company expects that its capital expenditures will increase in future periods to support new product development and production 
the cash used in investing activities in fiscal years and was primarily related to the purchase of short term investments and capital equipment 
the company s financing activities in fiscal  and represent the exercise of stock options  activities related to the company s employee stock purchase plan and the ipo 
the company s principal commitments consist primarily of leases on its headquarters facilities and certain operating equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although the company believes that its existing cash balance will decrease moderately during fiscal as a result of increased operating expenses and acquisition related activities  the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to meet its cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of the company s cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  to obtain the right to use complementary technologies  to obtain additional presence on the internet or to support additional advertising and promotional campaigns
