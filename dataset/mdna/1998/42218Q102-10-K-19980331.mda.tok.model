in connection with the specialists orthopaedic medical corporation affiliation transactions  the company agreed to make a  loan to specialist scn llc  a california limited liability company the llc company 
the llc company was organized on november  pursuant to an operating agreement by and among the llc company  the company and four physicians 
the company has a membership interest in the llc company 
the physicians who own membership interests in the llc company have severally guaranteed up to  of any loan obligations of the llc company to the company

pursuant to the service agreements with the affiliated practices  the company purchases  subject to adjustment  the accounts receivable of the affiliated practices monthly and anticipates that it will have a similar obligation under service agreements entered into in the future 
the purchase price for such accounts receivable generally equals the gross amounts of the accounts receivable recorded each month  less adjustments for contractual allowances  allowances for doubtful accounts and other potentially uncollectible amounts based on the practice s historical collection experience  as determined by the company 
however  the company and certain affiliated practices are currently making periodic adjustments so that amounts paid by the company for the accounts receivable are adjusted upwards or downwards based on the company s actual collection experience 
while the company believes  based on its discussions with the other affiliated practices  that this arrangement is acceptable to them  the company cannot assure that this arrangement will be effected in all cases 
the company generally bears the collection risk with respect to outstanding receivables acquired in connection with an affiliation 
the company expects to use working capital to fund its obligation to purchase  subject to adjustment  the accounts receivable on an ongoing basis 
no adjustments will be made to reflect financing costs related to the carrying of such receivables by the company 
in connection with its affiliation transactions  the company recorded deferred income taxes associated with book and tax temporary differences in accordance with statement on financial accounting standards no 
these liabilities are principally attributable to the temporary differences associated with identifiable intangible assets and the assumption by the company of certain cash basis net assets of the predecessor practices 
at december   the deferred taxes related to these items were approximately million and million  respectively 
the deferred taxes associated with identifiable intangible assets are payable over the amortizable life of the intangible asset while those related to the cash basis net assets are payable over a four year period commencing in the year of affiliation 
based on current levels of operation  it is anticipated that cash payments to taxing authorities will exceed income tax expense reflected on the company s statement of operations by approximately million 
additional acquisitions of practice assets will most likely increase the estimate significantly 
management believes that funds available under the company s line of credit and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations at its current level for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company anticipates that it will require additional funds to finance capital expenditures relating to expansion of its business 
the company expects that capital expenditures during will relate primarily to i affiliations with additional practices  if any  ii the development of ancillary facilities  iii expansion and replacement of medical and office equipment for the affiliated practices and iv the purchase of equipment for expansion of its corporate offices 
the company anticipates that  in order to fund expansion of its business  it may incur from time to time additional short and long term bank indebtedness and may issue equity or debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if funds are unavailable when needed  the company may be compelled to modify its expansion plans 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using the as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has initiated an internally managed year program designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and transactions with customers  suppliers and financial institutions 
the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace some portions of the practice management systems at its affiliated practices so that the systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the cost of these year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
however  the company seeks to expand its business through additional affiliations  and there can be no assurance that systems at practices that affiliate with the company in the future will be year compliant or  if not year compliant  will be converted on a timely basis 
the company also has initiated discussions with its significant suppliers to determine whether those parties will be subject to the year issue where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise have an impact on company operations 
the company is assessing the extent of which its operations are vulnerable should its suppliers fail to remediate properly their computer systems 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns with respect to its internal systems and those of its affiliated practices  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis 
the failure of such other entities to remediate any year issue on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company
