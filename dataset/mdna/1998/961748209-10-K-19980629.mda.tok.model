mobile power systems sales  from may   the date of the mcii electric acquisition to march   were  sales for this product group were relatively low due to several factors that affected production and normal sales and margins 
one of the company s major contracts  the tqg contract has a development phase that was only partially complete when the company was acquired 
to complete the required development work  the company focused considerable time and resources  and no sales revenues or margins were recorded during this phase 
at year end  the company has provided for additional estimates to complete this development  and expects to begin production and develop sales revenues on this contract beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal on another major contract  the air force mep program  it was necessary to fulfill past contract requirements before the company could begin recognizing full sales and margins on shipments 
this phase of the contract was completed in march  and the company began making shipments under this contract recognizing normal sales and margins beginning in april 
engineered automation and control systems sales  from may   the date of the tano acquisition to march   were  the us coast guard wlb wlm buoy tender program was a major contract contributing to sales revenues during the period 
marine electrical switchgear sales for the fiscal year ended march  declined to  compared to  for the prior year 
a declining backlog of major long term switchgear contracts as a result of the down turn in navy shipbuilding was the primary reason for the substantial decrease in sales revenues for this product line 
marine electrical hardware sales for the fiscal year were  a decrease compared to the previous year 
a factor in the lower sales for the fiscal year was the negative impact on production output during the first quarter when certain manufacturing operations were relocated from massachusetts to tulsa 
twelve months ended march  and net income for the fiscal year ended march  was  a increase compared to  for the previous year 
earnings per share were  compared to 
for the previous year 
total consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended march  were  a increase compared to  for the prior year 
a breakdown of sales by product lines shows marine hardware sales of  an increase of over the previous year  mainly as a result of the roflan peter gray acquisition in may  sales of safety sealing products by roxcorp were  an increase of over the prior year  and primarily due to increased penetration into the telecommunication industry 
sales of engineered switchgear products by nmp corp 
declined to  compared to  for the previous fiscal year 
lower production on the ddg program due to the winding down of that contract was the major reason for the decline 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales  improved to compared to for the prior year 
the increase in sales of higher margin safety sealing systems  as well as cost reductions in certain switchgear products  accounted for most of the improvement in gross margin 
operating income increased to  a increase over the previous year 
interest expense increased to  as a result of increased borrowing 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  resulted in net cash used of  during this period  cash was provided by major cash adjustments and sources of depreciation and amortization of  and impairment loss of  reductions in accounts receivable of  and inventories of  and increases in accounts payable of  and accrued liabilities of  major uses of cash were the net loss of  the gain on sale of subsidiary of  increases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of  and reductions in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of  and income taxes payable receivable of lower production activity and progress billings on major switchgear contracts  as well as heavy expenditures related to uncompleted mcii contracts that were only partially funded by progress billings  accounted for most of the activity related to contracts in process 
the acquisitions of tano and mcii in the first quarter  and the sale of roxcorp 
in the second quarter were the significant investing activities affecting cash flow for the fiscal year ending march  to facilitate these acquisitions  the company utilized available cash funds of  and borrowed a total of  of which  was under an amendment to the existing revolving credit agreement  and  under a short term bank loan 
in connection with the sale of roxcorp  the company received  and utilized  of the amount received to pay down its revolver loan balance with the balance used as working capital funds 
on september   the company executed a new  credit agreement with nationsbank providing a  one year revolving line of credit  and a  year term loan 
on february   the credit agreement was amended to provide an additional  term loan to mature september  the revolving line of credit has a borrowing base of acceptable receivables and inventories 
the company s cash flow and working capital was impacted during the latter half of the fiscal year  both as a result of the loss for the period  but also due to the completion requirements of certain mcii contracts 
completion of those contracts required the expenditure of substantial funds which the company could only partially recover through progress billings 
the company anticipates it will request an increase in the current line of credit  but that as a result of progress on the mcii contracts  and the expected return to profitability for the fiscal year ending march   future funding requirements should be substantially lessened
