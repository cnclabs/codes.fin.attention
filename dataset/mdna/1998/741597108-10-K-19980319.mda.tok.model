item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers the company s year ended december  as well as periods prior to when the company operated as the ordnance and aerospace divisions of olin  but has been prepared as if the company were a separate entity for all periods discussed 
results of operations years ended december  in thousands sales    gross margin    selling and administration    other charges   net income loss    year ended december  compared to sales increased in compared to sales primarily due to higher shipments of medium caliber ammunition  artillery propelling charges  ball powder r propellant  steel pipe joints  and space and electronics products 
these increases offset lower sales of international tank ammunition  solid propellant products  and electromagnetic systems 
increases in medium caliber ammunition sales reflect the correction of production problems that delayed shipments in the increases in artillery propelling charge sales reflect activity on a contract received in early  for which there was no comparable activity in ball powder r propellant sales increased over the depressed levels  principally due to improved commercial sales 
space products sales increases reflect higher shipments associated with the commercial satellite market 
electronics sales increases resulted from the introduction of the company s empower tm airline passenger seat power supply 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the gross margin percentage on medium caliber ammunition increased by approximately and reflects the improved delivery and cost performance for those products 
margin improvements also benefited from a product mix which included sales of artillery propelling charges and higher space  electronics  and ball powder r propellant sales 
these higher margin sales offset unfavorable performance that resulted in cost overruns during on ammunition de militarization and high pulsed energy contracts 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the increase reflects the combination of higher bid and proposal costs  which increased over the level  additional costs associated with the company s start up and status as a new independent public company and management incentive expense associated with improvements in the company s operating performance 
interest expense decreased from the level 
this reduction reflects the application of the company s cash flow to debt reduction and lower interest rates on outstanding debt 
the financial statements reflected million of debt outstanding for the entire year with an average interest rate of 
the average debt outstanding during was million with an average interest rate of 
income tax expense of million and million was recorded in and  respectively  on pre tax income of million in and a pre tax loss of million in the company s effective tax rate of is higher than statutory rates due principally to goodwill amortization  which is non deductible 
year ended december  compared to sales declined in compared to sales attributable principally to lower shipments of combined effects munitions  ball powder r propellant  and electromagnetic systems  which more than offset higher tank ammunition sales 
the lower sales levels of combined effects munitions and electromagnetic systems reflect the completion of major programs during the us government contract for combined effects munitions is not expected to be renewed 
sales of commercial ball powder r propellant declined in the period as sporting ammunition customers drastically reduced their purchases 
in  heavy consumer buying patterns for sporting ammunition were driven by a concern over the threat of restrictive legislation and taxation  which increased the demand for ball powder r propellant 
restrictive legislation in the form of the brady bill and the assault weapons ban was passed in and  respectively  while a proposed prohibitive tax on ammunition was not adopted 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in due primarily to the decline in sales of ball powder r propellant 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in due to lower sales and a higher level of expenses primarily associated with the distribution 
other charges in represented the provision for the settlement of claims related to a government investigation of certain testing irregularities at the company s marion  illinois facility million and the charge for the contract dispute with the belgian ministry of defense related to a sale of artillery ammunition million 
income tax expense of million and million was recorded in and  respectively  on pre tax losses of million in and pre tax income of million in the impact of the marion legal settlement  which is non deductible  and other higher non deductible expenses on a lower level of profits in were the main contributors to the higher effective tax rate for us government sales us government sales amounted to million in  million in and million in see item business us government contracts and regulations 
approximately  and  respectively  of total   and us government sales were to the united states department of defense dod or agencies thereof 
changes in the strategic direction of defense spending  the timing of defense procurements and specific defense program appropriation decisions may adversely affect the performance of the company in future years  including its income  liquidity  capital resources  and financial condition 
the precise impact of these decisions will depend upon their timing and the size of changes and the company s ability to mitigate their impact with new business  business consolidations or cost reductions 
in view of the continuing uncertainty regarding the size  content and priorities of the annual dod budget  the historical financial information of the company may not be indicative of future performance and the viability of certain facilities and equipment may also be impacted 
dod sales activities are historically stronger in the latter part of the year because the timing of the recognition of the dod ammunition sales tends to reflect the procurement cycle utilized by the us army 
since the us government usually awards and funds ordnance contracts on a year by year basis and the company s business is dependent upon periodic awards of new contracts and the exercise of options contained in existing contracts  there can be no assurance that the us government will continue to purchase the company s products and services over the long term 
the termination of any of the company s significant contracts or the failure to obtain either renewals of certain existing contracts or additional contracts with the us government would have a material adverse effect on its results of future operations and financial condition 
environmental the company is a party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with waste disposal  manufacturing and test sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former manufacturing and test facilities and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
historically  the company has funded its environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expects to do so in the future 
the company s consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million and million at december  and  respectively  which are classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
those amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between million and million annually over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the time periods sometimes lengthy over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against the company 
service costs from the time of the distribution to december   the company obtained certain services from olin  such as payroll and benefits administration  mainframe computing services  and telecommunications support 
olin was reimbursed by the company at rates comparable to the pre distribution inter company charges 
the cost of these services for was approximately million 
during  the company has developed or obtained these services on its own  at costs which approximate the rates charged by olin

however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have an adverse impact on operations of the company 
the company is in the process of evaluating whether its vendors  customers including the us government and other third party service providers are making adequate efforts to achieve year compliance 
the company cannot presently conclude whether year non compliance by such third parties is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations
