overview the company is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of computer equipment and related products  as well as the financing of the purchase thereof  in the federal republic of brazil 
based on continuing efforts by management to maximize long term profit margins and increase penetration into the marketplace directly to end users  the company has evolved from a miami based distributor of computer products to a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of personal computers and related products which are marketed and sold directly to end users in brazil 
this evolution commenced in when the company organized bahia as a wholly owned subsidiary to act as the company s manufacturing and distribution entity in brazil 
the creation of bahia marked the transformation of the company from a low margin us based distributor to a higher margin vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer using the model of other direct distribution computer companies 
the company s products  which include personal computers and multimedia systems and related peripheral products  networking and system integration equipment  and consumer electronics  are marketed under brand names owned by the company and other brand names for distribution through a variety of channels in the brazilian marketplace 
in furtherance of its business strategy  the company  in july  acquired of the outstanding capital stock of microtec 
microtec  based in cotia  sao paulo  brazil  is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of personal computers and servers in brazil 
microtec sells directly to corporate and government clients and through a nationwide network of over channel partners 
microtec participates heavily in all levels of bids and public solicitations in brazil 
since  microtec has established a brand name recognition for quality products and services in the brazilian market 
microtec has an installed base of approximately  personal computers in brazil 
microtec has extensive experience in the engineering and design of personal computers and has been granted an iso certification 
with a nationwide network of technical assistance and service centers  microtec has one of the most extensive post sale support systems in brazil 
in order to enhance its market penetration and its direct relationship with end users in brazil  the company  in november  acquired a majority interest in techshop  located in belo horizonte  brazil  and in rectech  located in recife  brazil 
the operations of techshop and rectech include regional distribution and sales of computers and related equipment in the corporate and retail markets in brazil 
the companies are well suited to the company s business strategy of selling directly to individual consumers  corporate clients and governmental entities  and they add strength to the company s direct marketing and support services in the central and northeastern regions of brazil 
the evolution of the company from a miami based distributor to a vertically integrated manufacturer and integrator of complete computer systems has resulted in the current business model which management believes will maximize the long term profit margin of the company 
this business model consists of a us operation  vitech america  inc  which serves as the a distributor of computer components to its subsidiaries in brazil 
vitech america  inc purchases components worldwide for consolidation and processing at its miami operation to be sold and shipped to its subsidiaries in brazil 
the subsidiaries serve as the company s manufacturing and sales operations in brazil 
this model results in substantially all of the consolidated earnings of the company to be attributable to the company s subsidiary operations 
for the foreseeable future  the company will continue with this model in order to maximize the earnings in brazil which will be reinvested for the continued growth of the company s brazilian operations

starting in the fourth quarter of  the company vertically integrated into manufacturing 
as a result of this transformation  the company has been able to achieve higher margins through the vertical integration 
the decrease was also attributable to the company s migration from peripheral products and related products to a full line of branded computer systems and network solutions with greater aggregated value and greater control over pricing to the customer 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or approximately  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  such increase was primarily related to the increased costs associated with the creation of bahia and its manufacturing facility being brought on line as well as the increased selling activity in brazil associated with marketing directly to end users

shareholders should carefully consider the information set forth in such disclosure and the following risk factors which constitutes cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
fluctuation of quarterly results 
the company s quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of  among other things  historical seasonal purchasing patterns in brazil  the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter  variations in sales mix  and delays in production schedules 
accordingly  the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in general  management expects that the company s financial results may vary materially from period to period

as the company has expanded the production and sales of personal computers  it has elected to phase out the contract manufacturing of consumer electronics 
while the company believes that its expansion efforts in the areas of personal computers and related products will be sufficient to replace the loss of revenues associated with the phasing out of the contract manufacturing of consumer electronics  there can be no assurance that such expansion efforts will be successful

during the year ended december   other than casas bahia and vitoria tecnologia sa  an affiliate through common ownership  no one customer of the company accounted for more than of the company s sales during such period 
political and economic uncertainty 
notwithstanding the recent stability of the brazilian economy and brazil s unrestricted foreign exchange market  the brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and occasionally substantial intervention by the brazilian government 
the brazilian government has  in the past  substantially influenced monetary  credit  tariff  and other policies  including exchange rates  and has utilized price and wage controls  the restriction of bank accounts  capital controls  and restrictions on exports to influence the economy  including to reduce extremely high levels of inflation 
future changes in  or the implementation of  such policies  and increased brazilian political uncertainty  could also have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial results 
foreign exchange risk

translation losses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
possible need for additional financing 
to maintain historical levels of growth  the company may need to seek additional funding through public or private financing and may  when attractive sources of capital become available  elect to obtain capital in anticipation of such needs 
adequate funds for growth through internal expansion and through acquisitions may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to the company 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities or related instruments with conversion or warrant features  dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if funding is insufficient  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of its expansion programs 
in addition  the company has in the past sought funding through third parties related to the company s management and there can be no assurance that these sources can be relied upon in the future 
based on the company s operating plan  the company believes that the projected cash flows from continuing operations and existing and contemplated sources of credit will be sufficient to satisfy its capital requirements and finance its plans for expansion for the next months 
such belief is based on certain assumptions  and there can be no assurance that such assumptions are correct 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements for such period 
also  there can be no assurance that such contemplated sources will be available at the time they are needed 
in any of such events  the company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion 
expiration of tax exempt status

the company is exempted from the payment of brazilian federal income tax through and including the year provided the company meets certain budgeted production goals 
accordingly  upon the expiration of the company s tax exempt status  or the inability of the company and the federal government of brazil to renegotiate such budgeted production goals  the company s after tax earnings may be expected to decline substantially 
while the company and the federal government of brazil have agreed to budgeted production goals in the past  there can be no assurance that they will successfully do so in future periods 
the company is not exempted from the payment of a federal social contribution tax of of income 
assets outside the us  enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons 
while the company is a us corporation with executive offices in florida  its principal operations are conducted by its subsidiaries  which are domiciled in brazil 
for the foreseeable future  a substantial portion of the company s assets will be held or used outside the us in brazil 
enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the federal securities laws may also be affected by the fact that while the company is located in the us  its principal subsidiary and operations are located in brazil 
although the company s executive officers and directors are residents of the us  all or a substantial portion of the assets of the company are located outside the us acquisitions  integration of microtec into the company s operations 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of microtec and in november   the company completed the acquisitions of rectech and techshop 
additionally  the company s business strategy includes other potential acquisitions as they are targeted and consummated 
acquisitions  including that of microtec  involve a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including i the diversion of management s attention  ii the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  iii the amortization of acquired intangible assets  iv the assumption of potential liabilities  disclosed or undisclosed  associated with the business acquired  which liabilities may exceed the amount of indemnification available from the seller  v the possibility that the financial and accounting systems utilized by the business acquired will not meet the company s standards  vi the possibility that the business acquired will not maintain the quality of services that the company has historically provided  vii the dilutive effect of the use of the company s common stock as consideration for transactions  and viii the possibility that the company will be unable to attract and retain qualified local management for both acquirees operations and the ensuing consolidated operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any future acquisitions on satisfactory terms  that adequate financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or that any acquired operations will be successfully integrated or that such operations will ultimately have a positive impact on the company  its financial condition or results of operations 
the effect of volatility on the repatriation of excess retained earnings through the floating rate market 
for the foreseeable future  bahia does not intend to distribute any excess retained earnings to its us parent  but intends to reinvest such earnings  if any  in the development and expansion of its business 
substantially all of the retained earnings of the company on a consolidated basis are attributable to bahia 
bahia is exempt from the payment of brazilian federal income tax through and including the year tax exemption benefits cannot be distributed as dividends to the company in us dollars and are segregated for capital reserves and offsetting accumulated losses in accordance with brazilian law 
for the years ended december  and  the tax exemption benefits amounted to  and  respectively 
in the future  should bahia wish to remit retained earnings in excess of the tax exemption benefits  it may do so only in reais convertible into us dollars in the floating rate exchange market the floating market 
there are two legal foreign exchange markets in brazil the commercial rate exchange market the commercial market and the floating market 
the commercial market rate is the commercial selling rate for brazilian currency into us dollars  as reported by the central bank 
the floating market rate generally applies to transactions to which the commercial market rate does not apply 
prior to the implementation of the real plan  the commercial market rate and the floating market rate differed significantly at times 
since the introduction of the real  the two rates have not differed significantly 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be significant differences between the two rates in the future 
both the commercial market rate and the floating market rate are reported by the central bank on a daily basis 
in order for a company to remit retained earnings abroad at the commercial market rate  brazilian law first requires the registration of the foreign capital upon which those retained earnings were made 
bahia has applied with the central bank of brazil to register its original foreign capital investment in order to allow it to remit excess retained earnings at the commercial market rate
