the company is aware of the potential issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the primary issue is whether or not computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause the system to fail 
management does not anticipate that the company will incur either significant operating expenses or significant capital expenditures to be year compliant with respect to both its internal systems and the software tools that it markets 
in fact  the company s software tools and services could be utilized by hie s customers and prospects to enable their systems to become year compliant 
the company expects the following external factors to affect the market for integration software tools and integration services in future years the continued consolidation of enterprises within various industries to achieve economies of scale  the growing importance of information for the survival and prosperity of various enterprises  the increasing complexity of information technology  and the year issue referred to above

the costs of individual software tools are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight line basis over not more than five years  whichever method results in a higher level of annual amortization 
the excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired goodwill is being amortized over a period of fifteen years 
at each balance sheet date  the company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation

the company reported steadily improving revenue during each quarter of for both software and services revenue 
management believes that the decrease in revenue between and was neither a general marketplace nor a company software or service issue  but was primarily due to a company distribution problem that management sought to address throughout the year by increasing the size of the direct sales force and the number of distributors 
hie more than doubled its sales force and added new distributors during the latter part of cost of revenue 
the cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in cost of revenue from to of revenue between and is primarily attributable to the company sub licensing more third party imaging  workflow and internet software tools in than it did during  as well as a relatively low level of service personnel productivity at the beginning of third party software tools typically have a higher relative cost than the company s proprietary software tools  such as the cloverleaf integration engine and the emerge enterprise master person index software tool

the mix of revenue shifted to more service revenue than software revenue between and even though software revenue declined as a percent of total revenue in  it still increased between and due primarily to the continued growth of integration engine license fee revenue supplemented by software license fee revenue from the cass and the emerge software tools  both of which were released for general availability to the market during the second half of services revenue grew in due to the continued growth in software maintenance  implementation and education services related to the integration engine software tool and  more significantly  the demand by enterprises for system design  implementation and integration services of the imaging  workflow  internet  emerge and cass software tools
