promark also faces significant competition from other gas marketers  some of whom are significantly larger in size and have greater financial resources than promark  canadian forest or the company 
regulation united states 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
all of the jurisdictions in which the company owns producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas  including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells and maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
the company s operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
some states  such as texas and oklahoma  have  in recent years  reviewed and substantially revised methods previously used to make monthly determinations of allowable rates of production from fields and individual wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  and to limit the number of wells or the location at which the company can drill 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
deregulation of wellhead sales in the natural gas industry began with the enactment of the ngpa in in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act 
the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate the company s activities  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
it is unclear what impact  if any  increased competition within the natural gas industry under order no 
will have on the company s activities 
although order no 
could provide the company with additional market access and more fairly applied transportation service rates  order no 
could also subject the company to more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation of those tolerances 
order and subsequent ferc orders issued in individual pipeline restructuring proceedings have been the subject of appeals  the results of which have generally supported the ferc s open access policy 
in  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit largely upheld order no 
because further review of certain of these orders is still possible  other appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the orders on the company and its production efforts 
the ferc has announced several important transportation related policy statements and proposed rule changes  including the appropriate manner in which interstate pipelines release capacity under order no 
and  more recently  the price which shippers can charge for their released capacity 
in addition  in  ferc issued a policy statement on how interstate natural gas pipelines can recover the costs of new pipeline facilities 
in january  the ferc issued a policy statement and a request for comments concerning alternatives to its traditional cost of service ratemaking methodology 
a number of pipelines have obtained ferc authorization to charge negotiated rates as one such alternative 
in february  the ferc announced a broad inquiry into issues facing the natural gas industry to assist the ferc in establishing regulatory goals and priorities in the post order no 
environment 
in november  the ferc issued a proposed rulemaking to further standardize pipeline transportation tariffs that  if implemented as proposed  could adversely affect the reliability of scheduled interruptible transportation service 
in december  the ferc requested comments on the financial outlook of the natural gas pipeline industry  including among other matters  whether the ferc s current rate making policies are suitable in the current industry environment 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect the company only indirectly  these policy statements and proposed rule changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
the company cannot predict what action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can it predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets 
however  the company does not believe that it will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which it competes 
commencing in october  the ferc issued a series of rules order nos 
and a establishing an indexing system under which oil pipelines are able to change their transportation rates  subject to prescribed ceiling levels 
the indexing system  which allows or may require pipelines to make rate changes to track changes in the producer price index for finished goods  minus one percent  became effective january  in certain circumstances  these rules permit oil pipelines to establish rates using traditional cost of service or other methods of rate making 
the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of order nos 
and a  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from the company s oil producing operations 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
although the ferc has opted not to impose the regulations of order no 
 in which the ferc implemented the ocsla  on gatherers and other non jurisdictional entities  the ferc has retained the authority to exercise jurisdiction over those entities if necessary to permit non discriminatory access to service or the ocs 
certain operations the company conducts are on federal oil and gas leases  which the minerals management service mms administers 
the mms issues such leases through competitive bidding 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the ocs to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms proposed additional safety related regulations concerning the design and operating procedures for ocs production platforms and pipelines 
these proposed regulations were withdrawn pending further discussions among interested federal agencies 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas and has recently proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that the company can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require any company operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition and operations 
in addition  the mms is conducting an inquiry into certain contract agreements from which producers on mms leases have received settlement proceeds that are royalty bearing and the extent to which producers have paid the appropriate royalties on those proceeds 
the company believes that this inquiry will not have a material impact on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in april  after two years of study  the mms withdrew proposed changes to the way it values natural gas for royalty payments 
these proposed changes would have established an alternative market based method to calculate royalties on certain natural gas sold to affiliates or pursuant to non arm s length sales contracts 
the mms has also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposes to amend its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
this proposed rule would modify the valuation procedures for both arm s length and non arm s length crude oil transactions to decrease reliance on oil posted prices and assign a value to crude oil that better reflects market value  establish a new mms form for collecting value differential data  and amend the valuation procedure for the sale of federal royalty oil 
the company cannot predict what action the mms will take on this matter  nor can it predict at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding how the company might be affected by this amendment to the mms regulations 
recently  the mms has issued a final rule to clarify the types of costs that are deductible transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation of production sold off the lease 
in particular  under the rule  the mms will not allow deduction of costs associated with marketer fees  cash out and other pipeline imbalance penalties  or long term storage fees 
the company cannot predict what  if any  effect the new rule will have on its operations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress  states  the ferc and the courts 
the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company does not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
oil spill financial responsibility requirements united states 
as originally enacted  the oil pollution act of opa would have required the company to establish million in financial responsibility to cover oil spill related liabilities 
under recent amendments to the opa  the responsible person for an offshore facility located seaward of state waters  including ocs facilities  will be required to provide evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of million 
although the financial responsibility requirement for offshore facilities located landward of the seaward boundary of state waters including certain facilities in coastal inland waters is a lesser amount million  the company currently has a number of offshore facilities located beyond state waters and  thus  is subject to the million financial responsibility requirement 
the amount of financial responsibility may be increased  to a maximum of million  if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations 
the company expects that financial responsibility could be established through insurance  guaranty  indemnity  surety bond  letter of credit  qualification as a self insurer or a combination thereof 
the company cannot predict the final form of any financial responsibility rule that may be adopted by the mms under opa  but in any event  the impact of the rule is not expected to be any more burdensome to the company than it will be to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
the company currently satisfies similar requirements for its ocs leases under ocsla 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect the operations of the company in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
in canada  producers of oil negotiate sales contracts directly with oil purchasers  with the result that the market determines the price of oil 
the price depends in part on oil quality  prices of competing fuels  distance to market and the value of refined products 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any such export has been obtained from the national energy board neb 
any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration up to a maximum of years requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb and the issue of such a license requires the approval of the canadian federal government 
in canada  the price of natural gas sold in interprovincial and international trade is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers 
natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the neb and the government of canada 
producers and exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb and the government of canada 
as is the case with oil  natural gas exports for a term of less than two years must be made pursuant to an neb order  or  in the case of exports for a longer duration  pursuant to an export license from the neb with canadian federal government approval 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use based upon the proportion prevailing in the most recent month period  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  and iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
in alberta  a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the artc program is based on a price sensitive formula  and the artc rate varies between  at prices for oil below cdn per cubic meter  and  at prices above cdn per cubic meter 
the artc rate is applied to a maximum of  cdn of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
crown royalties on production from producing properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible for artc 
the rate is established quarterly based on the average par price  as determined by the alberta department of energy for the previous quarterly period 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control 
on december  the government of alberta gave notice that they intended to review the artc program 
any changes to the program will not take effect prior to oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by the company to the provincial governments 
the artc program provides a rebate on crown royalties paid in respect of eligible producing properties in alberta 
environmental matters 
extensive federal  state  provincial and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of the company 
compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of forest and its subsidiaries 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
nevertheless  changes in environmental law have the potential to adversely affect the company s operations 
for instance  a few courts have ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act commonly called superfund and thus the company could become subject to the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the federal superfund program if significant concentrations of such wastes were determined to be present at the company s properties or to have been produced as a result of the company s operations 
alternately  pending amendments to superfund presently under consideration by the us congress could relax many of the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the statute 
the us oil pollution act opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages 
opa also requires operators of offshore facilities to demonstrate to the minerals management service mms that they possess at least million in financial resources that are available to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
the us water pollution control act commonly called the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes in navigable waters 
many state discharge regulations and the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system generally prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into coastal waters 
although the costs to comply with these recently enacted zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant  the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs and the company believes that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operations 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
in alberta  environmental compliance has been governed by the alberta environmental protection and enhancement act aepea since september  in addition to replacing a variety of older statutes which related to environmental matters  aepea also imposes certain new environmental responsibilities on oil and natural gas operators in alberta and in certain instances also imposes greater penalties for violations 
british columbia s environmental assessment act became effective june  this legislation rolls the previous processes for the review of major energy projects into a single environmental assessment process which contemplates public participation in the environmental review 
although the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
the company has established guidelines to be followed to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
the company has designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on the company and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
the company also employs an environmental manager whose responsibilities include causing forest s operations to be carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and implementing adequate safety precautions 
although the company maintains pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
forward looking statements certain of the statements set forth under item business and item properties and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  regarding planned capital expenditures  the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves  the number of anticipated wells to be drilled  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revisions  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are disclosed under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors relating to the company should be carefully considered when evaluating the company 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports and overall economic conditions 
from time to time  oil and gas prices have been depressed by excess domestic and imported supplies 
there can be no assurance that current price levels will be sustained 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
declines in oil and natural gas prices will adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations and may reduce the amount of the company s oil and natural gas that can be produced economically 
the company is impacted more by natural gas prices than by oil prices  because the majority of its production and reserves are natural gas 
at december   of the company s estimated proved reserves consisted of natural gas on an mcfe basis and  during  of the company s total production consisted of natural gas 
the average spot price received by the company for natural gas produced in the gulf coast decreased from per mcf at december  to approximately per mcf at december  and is expected to average approximately per mcf for the month of march during the same periods  the west texas intermediate price for crude oil decreased from per barrel to per barrel and was per barrel at march  in order to attempt to minimize the product price volatility to which the company is subject  the company  from time to time  enters into energy swap agreements and other financial arrangements with third parties to attempt to reduce the company s short term exposure to fluctuations in future oil and natural gas prices 
there can be no assurance  however  that such hedging transactions will reduce risk or mitigate the effect of any substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices 
any substantial or extended decline in the prices of oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operation 
for further information concerning market conditions  long term contracts  production payments and energy swap agreements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
uncertainty of estimates of oil and gas reserves 
this form k contains estimates of the company s proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues therefrom that rely upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission the commission as to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  such estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those estimated 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
in addition  the company s proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history  results of future exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
actual production  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from the estimates used  and such variances may be material 
approximately of the company s total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped  and thus are by their nature less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that substantial capital expenditures by the company will be required to develop such reserves 
although costs and reserves estimates attributable to the company s oil and gas reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards  no assurance can be given that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the present value of future net revenues referred to in this form k should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the company s properties 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the commission  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
the recent significant declines in oil and gas prices would have the effect of reducing the company s present value of future net revenues 
see volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value  will be affected by the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with development and production of oil and gas properties 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company or the oil and gas industry in general 
effects of leverage 
as of december   the company s long term debt was  including  outstanding under its bank credit facility the global credit facility 
in connection with the consummation of the louisiana acquisition  the company increased its aggregate borrowing capacity under the global credit facility from  to  as of february   the company had outstanding aggregate borrowings of  under the global credit facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s level of indebtedness will have several important effects on its operations  including i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the covenants contained in the global credit facility and notes indenture limit its ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of such assets and may affect the company s flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  iii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and iv the terms of certain of the company s indebtedness permit its creditors to accelerate payments upon certain events of default or a change of control of the company 
moreover  future acquisition or development activities may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter the leverage of the company 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company s future performance will not be adversely affected by such economic conditions and financial  business and other factors or that the company will be able to meet its debt service obligations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
furthermore  to the extent that the company is unable to repay its indebtedness at maturity out of cash on hand  it could attempt to refinance such indebtedness  or repay such indebtedness with the proceeds of an equity offering  at or prior to their maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its interest payment obligations under its indebtedness or that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of the company s indebtedness 
to the extent that the company is not successful in negotiating renewals of its borrowings or in arranging new financing  it may have to sell significant assets which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
among the factors that will affect the company s ability to effect an offering of its capital stock or refinance its indebtedness are financial market conditions and the value and performance of the company at the time of such offering or refinancing 
there can be no assurance that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
any failure by the company to satisfy its obligations with respect to any of its indebtedness at maturity or prior thereto would constitute a default under agreements governing other indebtedness  if any  of the company 
such defaults could result in a default on the notes and could delay or preclude payment of interest or principal thereon 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
ceiling limitation writedowns 
the company reports its operations using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
the company capitalizes the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  the company is subject to a ceiling limitation writedown to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation writedown is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such writedowns impact the amount of the company s shareholders equity 
the risk that the company will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if the company has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves or if purchasers abrogate long term contracts for its natural gas production 
the recent significant declines in oil and gas prices increase the risk that the company may be required to record a ceiling limitation writedown 
see volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
no assurance can be given that the company will not experience ceiling limitation writedowns in the future 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
availability of financing 
the company has historically addressed its long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  and through the use of credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities 
the company continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings or the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of the company  the issuance of nonrecourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  prospects and technical information  or joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  the company s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  including general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices and the value and performance of the company  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
replacement of reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics and vary from the steep declines characteristic of gulf of mexico reservoirs  where the company has a significant portion of its production  to the relatively slow declines characteristic of long lived fields in other regions 
except to the extent the company acquires properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful development and exploration activities  or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced 
the company s future natural gas and oil production is  therefore  highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable  the company s ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand its asset base of oil and gas reserves would be impaired 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future development  acquisition and exploration activities will result in additional proved reserves or that the company will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
industry risks 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these risks include the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered  that operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled and that title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  mechanical difficulties or shortages or delays in the delivery of drilling rigs  work boats and other equipment may limit the company s ability to develop  produce and market its reserves 
the company has encountered particular difficulties in securing drilling equipment in certain of its core areas in the past months 
there can be no assurance that new wells drilled by the company will be productive or that the company will recover all or any portion of its investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling  operating and other costs 
in addition  the company s properties may be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
industry operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures or discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
additionally  a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are located in the gulf of mexico  an area that is subject to tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practice  the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
there can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
the company cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
concentration of assets 
at march   the company had four offshore gulf of mexico wells  the combined production from which represented approximately of the company s daily deliverability 
the company s production  revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected if production from these properties decreases to a significant degree 
gas marketing trading and credit risk 
the company s operations include gas marketing through its subsidiary  promark 
promark s gas marketing operations consist of the marketing of canadian forest s gas production  the purchase and direct sale of third parties natural gas  the handling of transportation and operations of third party gas and spot purchasing and selling of natural gas 
the profitability of such natural gas marketing operations depends in large part on the ability of the company to assess and respond to changing market conditions  including credit risk 
profitability of such natural gas marketing operations also depends in large part on the ability of the company to maximize the volume of third party natural gas which the company purchases and resells and on the ability of the company to obtain a satisfactory margin between the purchase price and the sales price for such volumes 
the inability of the company to respond appropriately to changing conditions in the gas marketing business could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  a significant portion of the volumes sold by promark are sold at fixed prices under long term contracts 
the loss of one or more such long term buyers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
promark buys and sells gas in its trading operations for terms as short as one day and as long as one to two years 
profits generated by trading are derived from the spread between the prices of gas purchased and sold 
promark endeavors to offset its gas purchase or sales commitments with other gas purchase or sales contracts  thereby limiting its exposure to price risk 
the company is  however  exposed to credit risk in that there exists the possibility that the counterparties to agreements will fail to perform their contractual obligations 
international operations 
a substantial portion of the company s operations is located in canada 
the expenses of such operations are payable in canadian dollars and most of the revenue derived from natural gas and oil sales is based upon us dollar price indices 
as a result  the company s canadian operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian and us dollar 
the company is also required to recognize foreign currency translation gains or losses related to its notes issued by canadian forest because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of canadian forest is the canadian dollar 
as a result of the decline in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the fourth quarter of  the company reported a noncash translation loss of approximately  the company s canadian operations may also be adversely affected by canadian local political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other canadian laws or policies  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in canada 
to the extent that the company pursues opportunities in other countries  similar risks will apply 
competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
the company also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas to marketers and end users 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those of the company 
drilling risks 
drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often unpredictable  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions and shortages or delays in delivery of equipment 
there can be no assurance as to the success of the company s future drilling activities 
the company s current inventory of d and d seismic surveys will not necessarily increase the likelihood that the company will drill or complete commercially productive wells or that the volumes of reserves discovered  if any  would necessarily be greater than the company would have discovered without its current inventory of seismic surveys 
acquisition risks 
the company s recent growth has been attributable in part to acquisitions of producing properties 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond the company s control 
such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
in connection with such an assessment  the company performs a review of the subject properties that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices 
such a review  however  will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
the company is generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  and generally acquires interests in the properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of the company s competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to the company 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to acquire producing oil and gas properties which contain economically recoverable reserves or that it will make such acquisitions at acceptable prices 
uncertainties of consummation of the anschutz transaction 
the company has an agreement in principle with anschutz to acquire certain oil and gas assets from anschutz 
the consummation of the anschutz transaction is subject to the completion of a definitive agreement and the approval of the company s shareholders  other than anschutz at the company s annual shareholders meeting in may  there can be no assurance that conditions to the anschutz transaction will be met or that the transactions will be completed according to the terms currently contemplated  if at all 
marketability of oil and gas production 
the marketability of the company s production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
us federal and state regulation and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand all could adversely affect the company s ability to produce and market its oil and natural gas 
if market factors were to change dramatically  the financial impact on the company could be substantial 
the availability of markets is beyond the control of the company and thus represents a significant risk 
government regulation 
the company s oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling and abandonment bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa requires operators of offshore facilities to establish evidence of financial responsibility to address potential oil spills 
opa  together with other federal and state environmental statutes  also imposes strict liability on owners and operators of certain defined facilities for such spills  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
the production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations primarily relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
to date  expenditures related to complying with these laws and for remediation of existing environmental contamination have not been significant in relation to the results of operations of the company 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
see item regulation 
ownership position of anschutz 
based on the number of shares outstanding on february   anschutz owned approximately of the outstanding shares of forest s common stock 
the company has agreed in principle to issue  shares of common stock to anschutz in the anschutz transaction  which would increase anschutz s ownership position to approximately 
pursuant to a shareholders agreement between anschutz and the company the anschutz agreement  anschutz may designate three of the company s directors 
therefore  anschutz has the ability to exert substantial influence with respect to matters considered by the company s board of directors 
the anschutz agreement prohibits anschutz from acquiring in excess of of the outstanding shares of common stock 
the anschutz agreement terminates on july  under certain circumstances anschutz could have a veto power over proposed transactions between the company and third parties such as a merger  which  under applicable law  requires the approval of the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock 
it is unlikely that control of the company could be transferred to a third party without anschutz s consent and agreement 
it is also unlikely that a third party would offer to pay a premium to acquire the company without the prior agreement of anschutz  even if the board of directors should choose to attempt to sell the company in the future

the company continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of the company  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  or joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  the company s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  the prices the company receives for its future oil and natural gas production and the level of the company s production will significantly impact future operating cash flows

hedging program 
in addition to the volumes of natural gas and oil sold under long term sales contracts  the company also uses energy swaps and other financial agreements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas produced 
in a typical swap agreement  the company receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  the company pays the difference 
the company s current swaps are settled on a monthly basis 
at december  the company had natural gas swaps for an aggregate of approximately bbtu billion british thermal units per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from per mmbtu million british thermal units on an alberta energy company c aeco c basis to per mmbtu on a new york mercantile exchange nymex basis and an aggregate of approximately bbtu per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from to per mmbtu nymex basis 
the weighted average hedged price for natural gas under such agreements is and per mmbtu in and  respectively 
at december  the company had oil swaps for an aggregate of  barrels per day of oil during at fixed prices ranging from to per barrel nymex basis 
the weighted average hedged price for oil under such agreements is per barrel 
subsequent to december  the company entered into eight additional natural gas swaps 
the swaps are for  mmbtu of natural gas per day from march to november at fixed prices ranging from per mmbtu aeco c  us basis to per mmbtu nymex basis  with a weighted average price of per mmbtu
