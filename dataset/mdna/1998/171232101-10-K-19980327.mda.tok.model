item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents our past results and our expectations for the near term future 
the supplementary financial information and the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of our results and our financial position  are incorporated by reference from the corporation s annual report to shareholders  pages  and through certain statements in this document  as well as certain statements incorporated by reference herein  may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  such as statements that include the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by any such statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed or identified from time to time in the corporation s public filings with the securities exchange commission and specifically to risks or uncertainties associated with the corporation s expectations with respect to its activity value analysis program  year liabilities  its market risk evaluations or with respect to announced real estate plans or premium growth and investment income or cash flow projections and  more generally  to general economic conditions including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets  changes in domestic and foreign laws  regulations and taxes  changes in competition and pricing environments  regional or general changes in asset valuations  the occurrence of significant natural disasters  the inability to reinsure certain risks economically  the adequacy of loss reserves  as well as general market conditions  competition  pricing and restructurings 
operating income from continuing operations  which excludes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in operating income in reflects a fourth quarter charge of million after taxes related to the write down of the carrying value of certain real estate assets 
income from continuing operations  which includes realized investment gains and losses related to such operations  was million in compared with million in and million in decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year 
in may  the corporation completed the sale of its life and health insurance operations to jefferson pilot corporation for million in cash  subject to closing adjustments  none of which were material 
the life and health insurance operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
net income  which includes the results of the discontinued operations  amounted to million in compared with million in and million in property and casualty insurance property and casualty earnings were substantially higher in than in and property and casualty income after taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in earnings in was due to highly profitable underwriting results as well as strong growth in investment income compared with earnings in were adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses  resulting primarily from the winter storms in the eastern part of the united states in the first quarter 
investment income increased in compared with the prior year 
earnings in benefited from highly profitable underwriting results 
catastrophe losses were million in  million in and million in our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance coverage during the past three years since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
reported net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of compared with reported net premiums written increased in compared with personal coverages accounted for billion or of premiums written and commercial coverages for billion or 
a portion of the increase in premiums written in both and was due to changes in certain reinsurance agreements  which are discussed below 
for many years  a portion of the us insurance business written by the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries was reinsured on a quota share basis with a subsidiary of the sun alliance group plc 
similarly  a subsidiary of the corporation assumed a portion of sun alliance s property and casualty business on a quota share basis 
effective january   the agreements pertaining to the exchange of reinsurance were amended to reduce the portion of each company s business reinsured with the other 
consequently  during  the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries retained a greater portion of the business they wrote directly and assumed less reinsurance from sun alliance 
as a result of the merger of sun alliance with royal insurance holdings plc  these agreements were terminated effective january  therefore  in  the property and casualty subsidiaries retained an even greater portion of the business they wrote directly and assumed no reinsurance from sun alliance 
there was an additional impact on net premiums written in the first quarter of and due to the effect of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums as of january of each year resulting from the changes in retention 
a comparison of reported net premiums written with net premiums written adjusted to reflect the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance follows in millions reported net premiums written    premiums assumed from sun alliance net premiums written  excluding premiums assumed from sun alliance    portfolio transfers of unearned premiums increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with similarly  net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with after a review of the costs and benefits of our casualty excess of loss reinsurance program  effective january   we modified the program  principally for the excess liability and executive protection classes 
the changes included an increase in the initial retention for each loss from million to million and an increase in the initial aggregate amount of losses retained for each year before reinsurance becomes available 
these changes in our casualty reinsurance program increased net premiums written in by approximately million compared with the prior year 
during  we continued to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of the program 
as a result  effective january   we again modified the program  increasing the initial retention for each loss from million to million 
this change in our casualty reinsurance program increased net premiums written in by approximately million compared with these changes have had a positive impact on the cash flows and resulting investment income of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
premium growth in and was also due to the selective writing of new business  exposure growth on existing business and the purchase of additional coverages by current customers 
the worldwide marketplace continued to be competitive  particularly in the commercial classes in the united states 
competitors continued to place significant pressure on pricing as they attempted to maintain or increase market share 
as a result  price increases continued to be difficult to achieve 
in this environment  we have focused on our specialty lines where we emphasize the added value we provide to our customers 
substantial premium growth in both years was achieved outside the united states from our international branch network 
underwriting results were profitable in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in the loss ratio was in compared with in and in the loss ratios continue to reflect the favorable experience resulting from the consistent application of our disciplined underwriting standards 
losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our expense ratio was in compared with in both and reported premium growth in the first quarter of will be distorted when compared with due to the sun alliance related transactions in the first quarter of as a result  reported net premiums written are expected to show a decline in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the corporation began an activity value analysis process to identify and then eliminate low value activities and to improve operational efficiency so that we can reduce expenses and redirect resources to those current activities and new initiatives that have the greatest potential to contribute to the future results of the corporation 
implementation will commence in the second quarter of the cost control initiative will result in job reductions in both the home office and the branch network 
while we have not yet fully quantified the impact of the initiative  we hope to achieve annual pre tax savings in the to million range  beginning in such savings are based on the elimination of certain payroll and payroll related costs  lease costs and other operating costs 
the corporation expects to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of related to the implementation of the cost control initiative 
the amount of the charge has not yet been quantified 
personal insurance reported premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with a increase in the effect on net premiums written of the changes to the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was as follows in millions reported net premiums written   portfolio transfers of unearned premiums increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with and in compared with we continued to grow our homeowners and other non automobile business in non catastrophe prone areas while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection 
personal automobile premiums increased as a result of an increase in the number of in force policies for high value automobiles 
our personal insurance business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the profitability of our homeowners business each year is affected substantially by the amount of catastrophe losses we incur 
homeowners results were highly profitable in  benefiting from modest catastrophe losses and reduced loss frequency 
results for this class were unprofitable in as catastrophe losses  particularly those caused by the winter storms  adversely affected results 
homeowners results were profitable in due to lower loss frequency 
catastrophe losses represented only percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our automobile business produced substantial profits in each of the last three years 
results in each year benefited from stable loss frequency and severity 
automobile results were adversely affected each year by losses from the mandated business that we are required by law to accept for those individuals who cannot obtain coverage in the voluntary market 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
personal excess liability profitability increased in and again in due to favorable loss experience 
commercial insurance reported premiums from commercial insurance increased in compared with in the effect on net premiums written of the changes to the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was as follows in millions reported net premiums written    portfolio transfers of unearned premiums increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with and in compared with premium growth in and for the excess liability component of our casualty coverages and for our executive protection coverages benefited from the changes to our casualty excess of loss reinsurance program 
premium growth in both years was also due to the selective writing of new accounts  exposure growth on existing business and the purchase of additional coverages by current customers 
premium growth was stronger outside the united states 
growth in the united states continues to be hindered by intense competition which has resulted in declining prices for several classes of business 
our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to differentiate our products have enabled us to renew a large percentage of our business 
our commercial insurance business produced near breakeven underwriting results in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in multiple peril results were unprofitable in each of the past three years due  in large part  to inadequate prices 
results for this class were also adversely affected in each of the past three years  but more so in  by increases in loss reserves for asbestos related and toxic waste claims 
multiple peril results were similar in and as an improvement in in the property component  due in part to an absence of catastrophe losses  was offset by higher losses in the liability component resulting from an increase in the frequency of large losses 
results for this class benefited in from an absence of catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage point in results for our casualty business were similarly unprofitable in each of the past three years 
in each year  casualty results were adversely affected by increases in loss reserves for asbestos related and toxic waste claims 
the amount of such reserve strengthening in the casualty classes decreased in and again in the excess liability component of our casualty coverages has remained profitable due to favorable loss experience in this class 
results for the primary liability component were extremely unprofitable in and due to an increased frequency of losses 
results in the automobile component were unprofitable in compared with breakeven results in and profitable results in the deterioration in was due to an increase in the frequency of large losses 
workers compensation results were unprofitable in and compared with profitable results in results deteriorated in and again in due in large part to the cumulative effect of price reductions over the past several years 
results continued to benefit  however  from the reform of benefit provisions of workers compensation laws in many states  and the impact of medical cost containment and disability management activities 
results from our share of the involuntary pools and mandatory business in which we must participate by law have also benefited from these positive factors 
property and marine results were unprofitable in compared with profitable results in and results in were adversely affected by an increase in the frequency of large losses  including several large overseas losses 
results in and were adversely affected by catastrophe losses which were insignificant in catastrophe losses for this class represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and of a percentage point in our executive protection results were highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
our financial institutions business was also profitable during the same period 
results in our other commercial classes were profitable in compared with the near breakeven results in and unprofitable results in this improvement was primarily attributable to our surety business  which produced increasingly profitable results in and compared with unprofitable results in due to several large losses 
reinsurance assumed reinsurance assumed is treaty reinsurance that was assumed from sun alliance 
the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was terminated effective january  however  due to the lag in our reporting of such business  net premiums written in the first quarter of included million related to business we assumed from sun alliance for the second half of net premiums written for this segment were reduced by million and million in the first quarter of and  respectively  due to the effect of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums back to sun alliance as of january of each year 
net premiums written in were substantially lower than in due to the changes in the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance whereby we assumed less reinsurance from them 
underwriting results for this segment in  which represent our share of the sun alliance business for the last six months of  were near breakeven 
underwriting results were also near breakeven in and loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
at the end of  gross loss reserves totaled billion compared with billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was billion at year end compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
as a result of the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  there were portfolio transfers of gross loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable as of january  and the effect of these portfolio transfers was a decrease in gross loss reserves of million and million and a decrease in reinsurance recoverable of million and million in and  respectively 
loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million in compared with million in the increase would have been greater except that loss reserves were reduced as the result of significant payments during the year related to the settlement of asbestos related claims against fibreboard corporation  which is discussed below 
loss reserves included million  million and million at year end  and  respectively  related to the fibreboard settlement 
loss and expense payments related to the settlement aggregated million in and million in there were no such payments in excluding the fibreboard reserves and the effect of the portfolio transfers  loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in compared with million or in substantial reserve growth has occurred each year in those liability classes  primarily excess liability and executive protection  that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such favorable development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
results in each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim severity trends for certain liability classes  this was offset each year in varying degrees by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the process of establishing loss reserves is an imprecise science and reflects significant judgmental factors 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss 
in fact  approximately of our net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have increased significantly  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in other cases have expanded theories of liability 
the industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
our most costly asbestos exposure relates to an insurance policy issued to fibreboard corporation by pacific indemnity company in in  pacific indemnity company  a subsidiary of the corporation  entered into a global settlement agreement with continental casualty company a subsidiary of cna financial corporation  fibreboard corporation  and attorneys representing claimants against fibreboard for all future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
this agreement is subject to final appellate court approval 
pursuant to the global settlement agreement  a billion trust fund will be established to pay future claims  which are claims that were not filed in court before august  pacific indemnity will contribute approximately million to the trust fund and continental casualty will contribute the remaining amount 
in december  upon execution of the global settlement agreement  pacific indemnity and continental casualty paid their respective shares into an escrow account 
upon final court approval of the settlement  the amount in the escrow account  including interest earned thereon  will be transferred to the trust fund 
all of the parties have agreed to use their best efforts to seek final court approval of the global settlement agreement 
pacific indemnity and continental casualty reached a separate agreement for the handling of all asbestos related bodily injury claims pending on august  against fibreboard 
pacific indemnity s obligation under this agreement with respect to such pending claims is approximately million  all of which has been paid 
the agreement further provides that the total responsibility of both insurers with respect to pending and future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard will be shared between pacific indemnity and continental casualty on an approximate and basis  respectively 
pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard entered into a trilateral agreement to settle all present and future asbestos related bodily injury claims resulting from insurance policies that were  or may have been  issued to fibreboard by the two insurers 
the trilateral agreement will be triggered if the global settlement agreement is ultimately disapproved 
pacific indemnity s obligation under the trilateral agreement is therefore similar to  and not duplicative of  that under those agreements described above 
the trilateral agreement reaffirms portions of an agreement reached in march between pacific indemnity and fibreboard 
among other matters  that agreement eliminates any pacific indemnity liability to fibreboard for asbestos related property damage claims 
in july  the united states district court of the eastern district of texas approved the global settlement agreement and the trilateral agreement 
the judgments approving these agreements were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
in july  the fifth circuit court affirmed the judgments of the district court 
the objectors to the global agreement appealed to the united states supreme court 
in june  the united states supreme court set aside the ruling by the fifth circuit court that had approved the global agreement and ordered the fifth circuit court to reconsider its approval in light of a june ruling by the supreme court rejecting an unrelated settlement that included several former asbestos manufacturers 
in january  the fifth circuit court again affirmed the global settlement agreement  ruling that it was legally distinct from the other settlement 
it is expected that objectors to the settlement will petition the supreme court to review the decision 
the supreme court would then have to decide whether to take the appeal 
the trilateral agreement  however  was never appealed to the united states supreme court and is final 
as a result  management continues to believe that the uncertainty of pacific indemnity s exposure with respect to asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard has been eliminated 
since  a california court of appeal has agreed  in response to a request by pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard  to delay its decisions regarding asbestos related insurance coverage issues that are currently before it and involve the three parties exclusively  while the approval of the global settlement is pending in court 
continental casualty and pacific indemnity have dismissed disputes against each other which involved fibreboard and were in litigation 
we have additional potential asbestos exposure  primarily on insureds for which we wrote excess liability coverages 
such exposure has increased due to the erosion of much of the underlying limits 
the number of claims against such insureds and the value of such claims have increased in recent years due in part to the non viability of other defendants 
our remaining asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers and distributors of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
we continue to receive notices of new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims as more peripheral parties are drawn into litigation to replace the now defunct mines and bankrupt manufacturers 
legal guidelines regarding coverage for asbestos claims have begun to articulate more consistent standards regarding the extent of the insurers coverage obligation and the method of allocation of costs among insurers 
however  we still do not know the universe of potential claims 
therefore  uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability for asbestos related claims 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
the prps  with proper government authorization in many instances  disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up have become substantial  prps and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities relating to these claims 
first  the underlying liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given clean up site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself  which has generated far more litigation than it has provided cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution which would reform the liability provisions of the law  congress has not yet addressed the issue 
it is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
the superfund law does not address non superfund sites 
for that reason  it does not cover all existing hazardous waste exposures  such as those involving sites that are subject to state law only 
there remains significant uncertainty as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
litigation costs remain substantial  particularly for hazardous waste claims 
a substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs 
this sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs in multiples of the policy limits 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
these reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were million in  million in and million in further increases in loss reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning asbestos and toxic waste claims are clarified  although the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses which had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  as well as the uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean up  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge that would adversely affect results in future periods 
the amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time 
other uncertainties the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries have an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
the corporation continually assesses its concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas and develops strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  the corporation has invested in modeling technologies that allow us to better monitor catastrophe exposures 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
the year issue relates to computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such programs may recognize the date as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities or other unforeseen problems 
in  we initiated a project to ensure year compliance of the corporation s computer systems and applications 
management believes that all key systems that are not already year compliant will be modified or replaced by the end of and that the costs to modify or replace such systems will not have a significant impact on the corporation s operating results or financial position 
we are also coordinating with entities with which we interact to address potential year issues to minimize the potential adverse consequences  if any  that could result from the failure of such entities to address this issue 
an additional concern to the corporation is the potential future impact of the year issue on insurance coverages written by our property and casualty subsidiaries 
the year issue is a risk for some of our insureds and needs to be considered during the underwriting process similar to any other risk to which our customers may be exposed 
we have established a dedicated team to identify year issues across all product lines 
it is possible that year related losses may emerge that would adversely affect operating results in future periods 
the amount cannot be estimated at the present time 
investments and liquidity investment income after taxes increased in compared with in growth was primarily due to increases in invested assets  which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period  partially offset by lower average yields on new investments 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased in as the percentage of our investment income subject to tax increased 
generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately  million in compared with  million in and million in new cash in and included approximately million and million  respectively  received as the net result of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums and loss reserves as of january of each year related to the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance 
new cash in also included million received in january as a result of the commutation of a stop loss reinsurance agreement related to medical malpractice unpaid claims arising from business written prior to the substantially lower amount in was due to the designation of million of new cash as funds held for asbestos related settlement 
income on these assets accrued for the benefit of participants in the class settlement of asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
in  new cash was invested primarily in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  million of foreign bonds were sold in the first quarter  due to the reduction in foreign liabilities resulting from the termination of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  with the proceeds invested in us dollar denominated securities 
in  we invested new cash primarily in mortgage backed securities and tax exempt bonds 
in  we invested new cash primarily in tax exempt bonds 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid  short term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs and the corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands 
corporate investment income earned on corporate invested assets and interest and other expenses not allocable to the operating subsidiaries are reflected in the corporate segment 
corporate income after taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in corporate income in was due primarily to a reduction in interest expense 
market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to financial instruments of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the corporation to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we view these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the table below provides information about the corporation s fixed maturity investments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
fixed maturities expected cash flows of principal amounts total estimated amortized market thereafter cost value in millions tax exempt    average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities    average interest rate mortgage backed securities   average interest rate total    the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that the corporation has minimal credit quality risk 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of taxable bonds are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or are rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  approximately are rated aa or better with more than half rated aaa 
less than of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
both taxable and tax exempt bonds have an average maturity of approximately years 
our taxable bond portfolio includes mortgage backed securities  which comprised and of this portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities are invested in call protected aaa rated commercial securities 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
we invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which we transact business 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of billion supporting their international operations 
such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the corporation are the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
the table on the following page provides information about the corporation s fixed maturity investments denominated in these two currencies at december  the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollars by expected maturity dates 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
foreign currency denominated fixed maturities expected cash flows of principal amounts total estimated amortized market thereafter cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our equity securities are high quality and readily marketable 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
real estate in october  the corporation announced that it was exploring the possible sale of all or a significant portion of its real estate assets 
in march  the corporation entered into an agreement with a prospective purchaser to perform due diligence in anticipation of executing a contract for the sale of substantially all of its commercial properties 
because the plan to pursue the sales of these assets in the near term represented a significant change in circumstances relating to the manner in which these assets would be used  we reassessed the recoverability of their carrying value as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million  or million after tax  in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
in june  a definitive agreement was reached with the purchaser 
in november  the sale of almost all of the properties covered by the agreement reached in june was closed for million  which included million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
the buyer is a joint venture formed by paine webber real estate securities inc  morgan stanley real estate fund ii  lp and gale wentworth  lp closing on the few remaining properties under the agreement is expected to occur in in addition to the november sale to the joint venture  we sold several other commercial properties as well as residential properties in we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
we plan to retain approximately million of undeveloped land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we plan to retain certain properties and land parcels under lease 
real estate operations resulted in a loss after taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in and income of million in the loss in reflects the million after tax impairment charge 
results in benefited from the sale of several rental properties and a decrease in interest expense caused by lower average interest rates 
results in benefited from a land sale 
results in both and also benefited from increases in earnings from residential sales 
in each of the last three years  results were adversely affected by a high proportion of interest costs charged directly to expense rather than being capitalized 
revenues were million in  million in and million in revenues in include million from the november sale of real estate properties 
proceeds received from that sale which related to mortgages receivable are not classified as revenues 
revenues in and included higher levels of revenues from residential development

the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in the first quarter of sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets 
sfas no 
requires that we analyze our individual buildings  leased land and development sites on a continuing basis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
estimates are made of the revenues and operating costs  plus any additional costs to be incurred to complete development  of the property in the future through an assumed holding period based on our intended use of the property 
the time value of money is not considered in assessing whether an impairment has occurred 
if it is determined that impairment has occurred  measurement of such impairment is based on the fair value of the assets 
the million write down of real estate assets in was made in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
loans receivable  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
our valuation approach is similar to that utilized under sfas no 
 except that cash flows are discounted at the receivable interest rates 
the reserve for possible uncollectible receivables was increased by charges against income of million in  including million from the initial application of sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which established new criteria for measuring impairment of a loan 
such charges were not significant in and management believes the reserve of million at december  adequately reflects the current condition of the portfolio 
the carrying value of the real estate assets we plan to dispose of in the near term is based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
the recoverability of the carrying value of the remaining real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the process by which sfas no 
is applied and necessary write downs are calculated assumes these properties will be developed and disposed of over a period of time 
the assumptions reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized 
real estate activities have been funded with short term credit instruments  primarily commercial paper  and debt issued by chubb capital corporation as well as with term loans and mortgages 
the weighted average interest cost on short term credit instruments approximated in  in and in in  interest rates on term loans approximated and for mortgages the range of interest rates was to

in february  the remaining million of intercompany borrowings from chubb capital was converted into preferred stock of the real estate subsidiary 
as a result of the november sale  real estate revenues will be significantly reduced in the future 
the reduction in revenues will be substantially offset by significant reductions in interest expense due to the decrease in debt outstanding and in payroll costs and other operating expenses
