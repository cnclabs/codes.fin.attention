the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period

operating results could also be adversely affected by general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for commercial mid range servers  and order cancelations or rescheduling 
in addition  the computer distribution industry experiences both seasonal trends and  within each quarter  tends to sell a substantial amount of its products at the end of the quarter 
for example  the company s largest vendor  ibm  sells approximately of its products in the last calendar quarter 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s net sales has been made in the last few days of a quarter 
accordingly  the company s quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly net sales to fall substantially short of anticipated levels and  to a greater degree  adversely affect profitability 
thus  the company believes that period to period comparisons of the company s operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company s future operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the company has required substantial capital to finance accounts receivable  inventories  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and has financed these requirements primarily through borrowings under credit facilities  cash generated from operations and recently  the issuance and sale of series a preferred stock and subordinated notes 
in september  the company negotiated with ibmcc to increase the ibmcc credit facility line from million to million 
the line was subsequently increased on a temporary basis to million through january  product purchases from ibm and cash advances from ibmcc are directly charged to the credit line and are paid by the company based on payment terms outlined in the ibmcc credit facility 
borrowings under the ibmcc credit facility are based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
the ibmcc credit facility is renewable in september and contains restrictive covenants which include the maintenance of minimum current  tangible net worth and times interest earned ratios  as defined 
as of december  and  the company had outstanding borrowings under the ibmcc credit facility of million and million  respectively 
of the total outstanding borrowings  million and million represented cash advances at december  and  respectively 
cash advances bear interest at the prime rate plus at december  
based on eligible assets  as of december   the company had additional borrowings available under the ibmcc credit facility of approximately million 
on september   the company entered into the note purchase agreement  pursuant to which the company sold million of subordinated notes to the purchasers  granted to the purchasers warrants the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the common stock and granted to the purchasers shares of series b preferred stock 
the subordinated notes  which are subordinated to the company s primary lender  ibmcc  bear interest at annually  include an original issue discount  fully earned upon funding  of  and are due september  the company may prepay the subordinated notes at of the principal balance subsequent to september   subsequent to september  and subsequent to september  on or after march   the purchasers may request redemption of up to of the subordinated notes issued at of the principal amount

the note purchase agreement contains restrictive covenants which include minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum income  minimum consolidated net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
the company used the proceeds from the issuance of the subordinated notes to consummate the sms acquisition 
on september   the company executed an amendment to its ibmcc credit facility  pursuant to which the company obtained the ibmcc credit advance to consummate the sms acquisition 
the ibmcc credit advance bears interest at the rate of prime plus at december  and is due in four installments through september  as part of the amendment  the company granted ibmcc warrants to purchase  shares of the common stock 
the warrants issued to ibmcc are the same  in all respects  to the warrants issued to the purchasers 
operating activities for provided cash in the amount of million 
for this period  cash was provided primarily as a result of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and a million increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories 
favorable accounts payable terms with ibmcc and increased leasing of product purchases by customers through ibmcc and third party leasing vendors  which decreased the average days to collect customer receivables  resulted in the generation of cash in for  net cash in the amount of million was used in operating activities  primarily as a result of higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories  increased sales volume and acquisitions  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable

cash provided by financing activities for was million  consisting primarily of borrowings under the note purchase agreement and the ibmcc credit advance totaling million and the issuance of series a preferred stock totaling million  partially offset by the company s reduction in short term borrowings by million 
for  cash provided by financing activities was million  resulting primarily from an increase in short term borrowings to fund working capital requirements 
the company believes it has sufficient funds  or alternate sources of funds  to carry on its business as presently conducted through see risk factors future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing 
year compliance the company believes that its business systems  including its computer systems  are not subject to the year problem  however  the company has begun to query its vendors and customers as to their progress in identifying and addressing problems that their computer systems may face in correctly processing date information as the year approaches 
see risk factors risks associated with potential year problems of third parties 
backlog although the company receives purchase orders for products to be delivered to customers over a specified time period  there can be no assurance that such orders will result in sales  as most orders are subject to revision or cancellation without penalty 
consequently  the company does not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales for future periods
