towards the end of and continuing into  the company has taken and is continuing to take actions to address the decline in product revenue including an increase in its domestic and international sales personnel and marketing activities  in addition to seeking to increase its strategic alliance relationships 
however  no assurance can be given that these actions will result in stabilizing or increasing product revenue 
net revenues increased million  or  in as compared to the acquisition of cybernetics and pulse accounted for an increase of million of the income in net revenues in product and software sales in declined million or 
the decrease in product and software sales is primarily a result of an increase in the company s allowance for sales returns million and the company s decision to take back a call processing system relating to a customer dispute million

cost of revenues and gross margins cost of revenues consists of product costs  amortization of computer software costs  installation costs  and maintenance and customer support costs 
the overall gross margin was million in  million in  and million in gross margin on product and software sales was million in  million in  and million in the increase in gross margin on product and software sold as a percentage of product and software sales revenue during compared to is primarily due to four factors 
first  the percentage of product and software sold associated with hardware declined by during  as compared to  as a result of customers purchasing the company s software to be installed on existing hardware 
second  during  the company recorded a million provision for costs associated with the completion and installation of products and the resolution of cybernetics contract obligations  a million inventory write down  and increased hardware costs associated with a cybernetics installation of million 
third  the cost of product and software sold as a percentage of product and software sales revenue in was negatively affected by the lower revenue base used in the calculation as a result of the sales returns and allowance explained above under net revenues 
fourth  staffing expenses included in the cost of product and software sold during decreased from the staffing expenses during the decrease in product gross margin from to reflects an increase in product costs as a percentage of product revenue from in to in primarily due to provision for costs associated with the cybernetics contract obligations and inventory write down discussed above  increased hardware costs associated with a cybernetics installation discussed above  and increased staffing and third party installation costs of million 
eis international  inc and subsidiaries gross margin on service and other revenue was million in  million in  and million in service and other costs were of service and other revenues during compared to in the decrease in costs of service and other as a percentage of service and other revenues during is due primarily to expenditures incurred during the periods for building the infrastructure of the service organizations in advance of generating additional service revenue 
the improvement in also resulted from a decline in the cost of supplying parts under customer maintenance agreements as a result of management s efforts to improve this operation 
service and other costs as a percentage of service and other revenue increased from in to in due to the addition of service costs associated with building the infrastructure of the service organizations in advance of generating revenues from these units during  as discussed above 
the company s gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including changes in sales volume  product mix  costs of product support and competitive pressures on pricing 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to sustain gross margins at previous levels 
research and development costs research and development costs as a percentage of total revenues were in  in  and in research and development costs decreased million to million during from million during this decrease was primarily due to a decline in such costs incurred by cybernetics and a decline in the use of subcontract software engineers see disclosures regarding year issues below regarding use of external resources during 
research and development costs increased by million or in over the addition of cybernetics during increased software development costs by million in additional cost increases during and reflect the continued expansion of the company s research and development staff and use of external consultants to support its ongoing product development

the company has a commitment to technological innovation 
it believes that additional research and development costs will be required to maintain the company s market position and that these costs may increase in absolute amounts in sales  general and administrative expense sales  general and administrative expense decreased million to million during from million during this decrease was primarily due to the fact that during the first quarter of  in connection with the restructuring as discussed above  eis consolidated several of its administrative functions and facilities and downsized its cybernetics and pulse subsidiaries 
selling expenses also decreased along with the decrease in net revenues 
sales  general and administrative expense increased million during as compared to this expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the principal reasons for the increase of this expense in over were the addition of cybernetics million  additional bad debt reserves of million  increased payroll and benefits of million and merger costs of  acquired technology in progress the acquired technology in progress costs of million incurred in reflect the fair value of the software products under development at cybernetics and pulse that had not achieved technological feasibility at the date of acquisition  had no alternative future uses  and were therefore charged against operations at the time of the acquisitions 
eis international  inc and subsidiaries write down of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of management performed a discounted cash flow analysis of cybernetics operations 
as a result of this analysis  management concluded that a write down of the intangible assets of cybernetics from million to zero was warranted 
other income  net other income  net is primarily interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents  along with interest generated from the company s lease portfolio 
other income  net was million in and  and million in interest income included in other income  net decreased from to primarily due to the sale of a major portion of the company s lease portfolio and lower average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances 
discontinued operations on february   at the recommendation of company management  the board of directors of the company resolved to discontinue the operations of surefind 
the decision to discontinue the operations of surefind was made after it became apparent that a higher than anticipated level of cash funding was needed to exploit surefind s product and such level was considered excessive given the cash requirements necessary to focus properly on the core business of the company 
surefind incurred a net loss of approximately million in and million in in connection with the decision to discontinue the operations of surefind  the company recorded a million estimated loss  net of tax benefits  on the disposal of surefind which includes a provision for anticipated operating losses prior to disposal 
income taxes the company s effective income tax expense benefit rate was   and for   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily attributable to the losses incurred by the company offset by the non deductible charges related to the acquired technology in process and the write down of intangible assets in the decrease in the tax rate from to is primarily attributable to the results discussed in the preceding sentence 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company established a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a level which  more likely than not  would be realized  when necessary 
the valuation allowance was increased in by million for the net operating loss carryforwards of cybernetics and surefind that were generated prior to eis ownership 
year issues background 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue affects nearly all companies and organizations 
impact on eis 
all eis products will be affected in some manner by year issues  except for empsx and wfm  which are already year compliant 
eis has developed and expects to implement in a plan the year product plan that makes necessary modifications to its products 
the current estimated cost to update eis products is approximately million 
eis expects to supplement its internal resources with external resources to complete the year product plan 
eis will seek to manage its research and develop costs and year product plan costs  so that eis total research and development costs are not materially different from eis research and development costs in and  but there can be no assurance it will be able to do so 
in addition to incurring research and development costs  eis may incur additional costs in other areas of its operation  including program management and installation services 
eis is planning to provide updated software to customers under eis maintenance contracts  and to eis international  inc and subsidiaries charge fees for on site visits  when necessary  and for certain other services to upgrade customer software 
eis products affected by the year issue will not be saleable during or after year  unless the year product plan is completed before that date 
failure to successfully implement the year product plan could have a material adverse impact on eis operations and financial condition 
eis expects to be successful in completing the year product plan changes to all of its products  however  upgrading all customers products that require such upgrades prior to year cannot be assured since a substantial part of the upgrade process will be dependent on the customer 
additionally  the estimated research and development costs discussed above could change materially as development of the year product plan proceeds 
eis is in the process of estimating the cost of bringing its internal software and hardware systems to be year compliant 
although this process may involve additional costs  eis believes that those costs will not have a material adverse affect on its operation and financial condition 
if that update is not completed in a timely manner  or if eis costs exceed the current estimates  the cost of year compliance for eis internal computer software and hardware systems could have at material adverse impact on its operations and financial condition 
eis also intends to determine the extent of any adverse impact resulting from failures by its major vendors and distributors to be year compliant  however  it is currently unable to estimate any such potential adverse impact  and such adverse impact could be material 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments primarily resulted from the million of net cash provided by operating activities in  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash of million used in investing activities during primarily related to additions to property and equipment of million for leasehold improvements incurred during the consolidation of facilities  and ongoing upgrades of internal computer hardware and software 
during  cash and cash equivalents were used for the purchase of businesses net of cash acquired of million  additions to property and equipment of million  discontinued operations of million  purchases of short term investments of million  and expenditures of million of software development costs capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
offsetting these uses of cash were cash provided in by the net sale of million of a portion of the company s lease portfolio as discussed further below  proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants and stock options  and net cash provided by continuing operations of million 
the company believes that its collection practices and terms of sale are consistent with practices in its industry 
the company generally receives a deposit upon order  a further payment upon installation and a payment of the invoice balance generally within to days after shipment 
the company has  from time to time  offered extended payment terms and lease financing to its customers  and it intends to continue these practices 
current and long term installment and lease receivables were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million is primarily due to payments of lease principal 
the company did not underwrite any significant new leases during on march   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a purchase agreement whereby a portion of its lease portfolio was sold to a financial institution for million in cash 
in july  an additional portion of the company s lease portfolio was sold under this agreement for million in cash 
all leases sold under this agreement are subject to certain recourse provisions and the company is a guarantor to the purchase agreement 
the company has also entered into an agreement with another leasing company under which the leasing company will provide favorable lease financing for eis customers  and in exchange  eis is subject to certain limited recourse provisions for certain leases 
the company provides for potential losses on recourse in its allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
at december   approximately million of leases subject to recourse are outstanding 
eis international  inc and subsidiaries on september   the company entered into a loan document modification agreement the new loan agreement which amended the terms and conditions under the previous line of credit 
under the new loan agreement  the company may borrow up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limitations  and amounts outstanding accrue interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
the new loan agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the company and expires on september  there were no amounts outstanding under the new loan agreement as of december  prior to the new loan agreement  the company had an unsecured line of credit of million with the same commercial bank under a commitment that expired in january the company expects that its current cash balances and short term investments  together with cash anticipated to be provided by operating activities  and amounts available under the new loan agreement  will be sufficient to fund its working capital requirements including research and development and year compliance costs for the foreseeable future 
however  the company s ability to achieve that result will be affected by the amount of cash generated from operations and the pace that its available resources are utilized 
accordingly  the company may in the future be required to seek additional sources of financing  including borrowing and or the sale of equity 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity  further dilution to shareholders may result 
no assurance can be given that any such additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
eis is party to various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business 
at this time  in the opinion of management  there are no pending claims  the outcome of which are expected to result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company  except for the shareholder lawsuit discussed above under item legal proceedings 
the company is currently not able to estimate the costs or a range of costs which may arise out of such shareholder lawsuit 
the company has  from time to time  received notices of potential intellectual property infringement claims against it 
based on the knowledge and the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes the resolution of the existing claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company
