any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities

further  the company has initiated a formal year compliance document whereby the company s software suppliers will certify their plans and action steps for modification or replacement of existing company software to ensure timely year compliance 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company will also initiate formal communications with its major customers and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to the failure of those third parties to address their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies upon which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
currently  the company does not expect that the costs associated with becoming year compliant will be material 
the company expects to complete its year assessments  modifications and conversions by the end of
