item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in order to make the comparisons more meaningful  the results of operations of the partnership for the year ended december  are compared to the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  are compared to the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  results of operations selected financial data for this discussion of the results of operations follows  in thousands 
years ended december  pro forma unaudited revenues gathering marketing    pipeline    gross margin gathering marketing    pipeline    general and administrative expenses    depreciation and amortization    operating income    interest income expense net  the profitability of genesis and the entities from which genesis was formed depends to a significant extent upon their ability to maximize gross margin 
the gross margin from gathering and marketing operations is generated by the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
in addition to purchasing crude oil at the wellhead  genesis purchases crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and enters into exchange transactions with third parties 
these bulk and exchange transactions are characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchase and sales transactions  and the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to gross margin  although such price levels significantly impact revenues and cost of sales 
because period to period variations in revenues and cost of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross margin for gathering and marketing operations  such changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
pipeline revenues and gross margins are primarily a function of the level of throughput and storage activity and are generated by the difference between the regulated published tariff and the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
changes in revenues  volumes and pipeline operating costs  therefore  are relevant to the analysis of financial results of genesis pipeline operations and are addressed in the following discussion of pipeline operations of genesis 
gross margin from gathering  marketing and pipeline operations varies from period to period  depending to a significant extent upon changes in the supply and demand of crude oil and the resulting changes in us crude oil inventory levels 
in general  gathering and marketing gross margin increases when crude oil inventories decline  resulting in crude oil for prompt generally the next month delivery being priced at an increased premium over crude oil for future delivery 
year ended december  compared with pro forma year ended december  the following analysis compares the results of operations for the partnership for the year ended december  to the pro forma results of the partnership for the year ended december  the pro forma consolidated financial statements of the partnership reflect the historical operating results of the crude oil gathering and marketing operations of basis and the crude oil gathering  marketing and pipeline transportation operations of howell 
because the partnership has no long term debt  the pro forma consolidated results reflect the elimination of interest expense 
income taxes were also eliminated from the pro forma consolidated results as the partnership is not subject to federal income taxes 
gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  field operating expenses decreased million  primarily due to a reduction in the number of tractor trailers 
the reduction in the fleet size resulted from efficiencies from the combination of the howell and basis fleets 
in  crude oil inventories were at low levels and demand for crude oil by refiners was strong 
gathering and marketing margins expanded as sale prices increased faster than prices paid to producers for crude oil and the wellhead 
in  crude oil supply exceeded refiner demand and gathering and marketing margins declined as sale prices decreased much quicker than prices paid to producers to acquire the crude oil 
margins in the period were also adversely impacted by increases in the cost to exchange sweet and sour grades of crude oil at midland  texas  for west texas intermediate at cushing  oklahoma 
pipeline gross margin increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  daily pipeline throughput volumes increased  increasing pipeline revenues by million 
in  the partnership began transporting crude from a new area in texas  increasing its revenues 
costs associated with transporting this crude are generally higher than the costs associated with the other crude the partnership transports 
general and administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million 
efficiencies from the combination of the howell and basis staffs contributed to this decline 
in addition  the partnership benefited from the sharing of certain services during the period in which basis provided services to the partnership under the terms of a corporate services agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction resulted partly from the full amortization of some assets contributed to the partnership by basis 
pro forma year ended december  compared with pro forma year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  field operating expenses increased by million  primarily due to higher fuel costs to operate genesis fleet of tractors trailers 
in the first half of  us crude oil inventories were at historically low levels and refiner demand for prompt delivery of crude oil was strong  leading to substantial backwardation in crude oil prices 
this backwardated market caused the sales prices received by the partnership to increase faster than prices paid to producers at the wellhead  which resulted in increasing gross margins for the six months ended june  as compared to the six months ended june  in the second half of  due to increasing crude oil inventories and reduced refiner demand for prompt delivery of crude oil  the sales prices received by the partnership decreased faster than the prices paid to producers  particularly as other gathering companies continued to pay higher producer bonuses in an effort to increase market share 
as a result of the expiration of a favorable provision in a large crude oil purchase contract with one of the partnership s principal customers that reduced gross margins by approximately million and the third and fourth quarters unfavorable pricing situation  pro forma gathering and marketing gross margin declined from the first half of to the second half of pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  although increased demand for crude oil resulted in increased gross margin in the gathering and marketing operations during the first half of  pipeline operations experienced a countercyclical decline in gross margin during the same period 
pipeline volumes per day increased slightly in the second half of low us crude oil inventories resulted in reduced pipeline utilization  which resulted in a decline of in pipeline throughput during compared to pipeline revenues for include nine months of tank rental fees totaling million charged to a third party for usage of storage tanks that the partnership owns in northwest houston whereas the period includes three months of tank rental fees totaling million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  of the reduction  million resulted from the full amortization in of costs capitalized from the jm petroleum corporation acquisition by basis in liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the one month ended december  the decrease in cash flow from the formation of the partnership to december  was due primarily to increases in inventories 
net cash used in operating activities of the predecessor was million for the eleven months ended november   and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease during was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable of million  only partially offset by an increase of million in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily for pipeline property additions 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the one month ended december  this amount primarily relates to the cash expended to acquire the howell operations 
for the eleven months ended november   net cash used in investing activities for the predecessor was primarily from the purchase of new tractors and nymex seats contributed to genesis 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million  primarily as a result of the sale of nonstrategic assets 
net cash utilized in financing activities was million in the year ended december   related to the payment of distributions to common unitholders and the general partner 
net cash provided by financing activities for the one month ended december   was million  consisting of the net public offering proceeds and general partner contribution at formation of the partnership totaling million  offset by the distribution to basis at formation of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the eleven months ended november  and net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted from advances between basis and the predecessor 
capital expenditures in  the partnership made a one time expenditure of million for furnishings for new offices 
additionally  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures relating to its existing operations and million for project additions 
the principal project addition related to expenditures needed to enable the partnership to transport in its pipelines the crude from a new area in texas 
capital expenditures for the one month ended december  and eleven months ended november  were million and million  respectively 
in each period  these expenditures were maintenance capital expenditures 
in the year ended december   capital expenditures by the predecessor were less than million 
maintenance capital expenditures on a pro forma basis for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the partnership estimates future maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately million per year 
these expenditures are expected to be primarily for improvements related to the three principal pipeline systems and for the periodic replacement of tractors and trailers in the partnership s fleet 
the partnership expects to fund its maintenance capital expenditure requirements from internally generated cash 
working capital and credit resources pursuant to the master credit support agreement  salomon will provide transitional credit support in the form of a guaranty facility over a period of approximately three years in connection with the purchase  sale or exchange of crude oil in the ordinary course of the partnership s business with third parties 
the aggregate amount of the guaranty facility will be limited to million for the year ending december  and million for the year ending december  to be reduced in each case by the amount utilized at any one time pursuant to the working capital facility and by the amount of any obligation to a third party to the extent that such party has a prior security interest in the collateral under the master credit support agreement 
the partnership is required to pay a guaranty fee to salomon which will increase over the three year period  thereby increasing the cost of the credit support provided to the partnership under the guaranty facility  from a below market rate to a rate that may be higher than rates paid to independent financial institutions for similar credit 
salomon has agreed to provide to the partnership  through march   a working capital facility of up to million  which amount includes direct cash advances not to exceed million outstanding at any one time and letters of credit that may be required in the ordinary course of the partnership s business 
the total amounts outstanding at any one time under this working capital facility will correspondingly reduce the amounts available under the guaranty facility 
the interest rate for the working capital facility is the federal funds rate plus 
the partnership expects to arrange for a working capital facility through one or more third party lenders or an extension of the working capital facility with salomon prior to the expiration of the availability of the working capital facility 
at december   the aggregate amount of obligations covered by guarantees was million  including million in payable obligations and million in estimated crude oil purchase obligations for january no direct cash advances or letters of credit were outstanding at year end 
salomon received a security interest in all the partnership s receivables  inventories  general intangibles and cash to secure obligations under the master credit support agreement 
there can be no assurance of the availability or the terms of credit for the partnership
