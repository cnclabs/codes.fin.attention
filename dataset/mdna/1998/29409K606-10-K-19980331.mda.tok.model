ims revenues increased million or over most steel industry customer sites reported strong production 
alexander mill services  inc  acquired in may  contributed million to revenues in as compared with million in the prior year 
however  revenue increases were largely offset by a revenue reduction resulting from a strike settled in mid august by a major steel customer s employees and the mid loss of a steel industry customer that accounted for million of revenues in technologies revenues increased significantly in as compared to due to a sharp increase in the volume of eaf dust a hazardous waste produced by steel mini mills processed at the company s ohio and idaho treatment facilities 
ims gross profit decreased due to the effects of the strike and the loss of a significant customer as outlined above and because a ownership change disrupted production at another customer s steel mill throughout technologies gross profit increased due to the increase in eaf dust disposal volume 
selling  general and administative expenses increased million as compared to cost savings realized as a result of the reorganization were more than offset by an increase in legal fees and expenses attributable to litigation between the company and its largest competitor in the eaf dust processing market  severance and other costs 
unusual items  net 
the unusual charges of million were recorded for costs to satisfy regulatory requirements at disposal sites that have been inactive since before the company s acquisition of iu international corporation iu international and to vacate an additional office as part of the company s further consolidation of its operations 
after related income tax benefits  the unusual charges reduced net income by approximately 
million or 
per share 
in unusual items included million of charges for the company s reorganization  million to settle the last disputed matter from the company s restructuring and 
million of closure costs for inactive disposal sites 
partially offsetting these charges was a 
million credit from reducing estimated liabilities remaining from the company s acquisition of iu international 
after related income tax benefits  the unusual items increased the loss from continuing operations by approximately million or 
per share 
even though debt levels were lower in the company paid down million of debt in the first quarter with proceeds from the sale of its imsamet subsidiary  interest expense of continuing operations increased million primarily because million of consolidated interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations in the prior year and also because the company s average effective interest rate was slightly higher in in the company recorded a million deferred tax credit as discussed below  without which the loss from continuing operations would have been more than million as compared with the loss from continuing operations of million after a negligible deferred tax credit 
in a million gain from selling imsamet and a 
million charge for the cumulative effect of a mandatory accounting change together with the loss from continuing operations resulted in net income of 
million 
deferred income taxes the company has determined that it is more likely than not that it will earn enough taxable income over the next several years to realize the million of deferred tax assets recognized in its balance sheet 
realization of this amount will require cumulative taxable earnings of approximately million 
when the consolidated results of continuing operations for the four most recent fiscal years are adjusted by excluding unusual items  and adding back goodwill amortization which is not deductible for tax purposes  the pre tax earnings  as adjusted  total over million and average million annually 
on this basis  the company would realize the million of deferred tax assets within approximately six years 
on the other hand  because its net operating loss carryforwards expire well into the future  the company would also realize million of deferred tax assets if  counting only profitable years  it earns million of taxable income during the fifteen year period ending in  so long as the cumulative amount of such earnings reaches at least million by  million by  million by  million by and million by in making its determination that it is more likely than not that it will earn enough taxable income to realize million of net deferred tax assets  the company considered its cumulative consolidated results of operations for the four most recent fiscal years  the reduction in interest expense obtained by applying the imsamet net proceeds to reduce debt  ongoing cost savings achieved with its reorganization  and profit improvements from treating increased volumes of eaf dust with its proprietary super detox r technology 
factors which could negatively affect this determination would include loss of a major customer or customers  prolonged work stoppages at major customers  a major decline in united states steel industry production  and a material decrease in the level of eaf dust currently treated with the company s proprietary super detox r technology 
in the company recognized million of net deferred income tax assets in its balance sheet 
the million of income tax benefits were credited as follows million reduced the loss from continuing operations  million reduced goodwill in the balance sheet because the related deferred tax assets arose from iu international acquisition obligations  and million increased capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet because the related deferred tax asset arose from net operating loss carryforwards that originated prior to the company s reorganization 
as described further in note c  the company has additional income tax net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets that are available to further reduce any future federal income tax payments 
versus year ended better worse december  than amount dollars in thousands revenues ims    technologies    gross profit ims    technologies   operating income loss ims    technologies    corporate headquarters    unusual items  net    although conditions in the steel industry remained generally favorable throughout  ims revenues decreased slightly 
the company s may acquisition of alexander mill services  inc contributed million to revenues in the year  but the increase was largely offset by the mid loss of a steel industry customer that accounted for million of revenues in at the beginning of the fourth quarter  a major steel industry customer s employees commenced a strike that continued in that customer contributed million of revenues in the fourth quarter 
also in our largest steel industry customer experienced an explosion and a day outage at its largest blast furnace 
technologies revenues decreased primarily because revenues included over million from the last major phase of a scrubber sludge stabilization system contract 
revenues also declined because treatment and disposal tonnage was lower during the first six months of due to overall depressed market conditions 
however  a year to year tonnage increase was realized during the second half of as the company obtained additional contracts to stabilize eaf dust 
ims gross profit decreased due to the strike and blast furnace outage discussed above together with somewhat lower profit margins at a number of other steel industry customer sites 
technologies gross profit declined primarily due to decreases in treatment and disposal volumes and margins and the lack of new stabilization system contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million due primarily to the effects of the reorganization discussed in the next paragraph 
unusual items  net 
in unusual items included million of charges for the company s reorganization  which was initiated to improve productivity and reduce costs 
the reorganization consisted principally of consolidating the company s headquarters functions in a single location 
the company s corporate headquarters in stamford  connecticut and the technologies segment s headquarters in horsham  pennsylvania were closed and their activities moved to the ims headquarters building  also in horsham 
as a result of the reorganization  approximately positions were eliminated  mostly in the technologies segment 
cost savings of million were realized during the year and ongoing annual savings were expected to approximate million 
in unusual items also included charges of million to settle the last disputed matter from the company s restructuring and 
million of additional closure costs for waste disposal sites that have been inactive since before the company s acquisition of iu international 
partially offsetting these charges is a 
million credit from reducing estimated liabilities remaining from the company s acquisition of iu international 
after related income tax benefits  the unusual items increased the net loss from continuing operations by approximately million or 
per share 
during the company favorably resolved a number of liabilities resulting from its iu international acquisition  primarily liabilities for insurance matters 
the benefit of these developments was partially offset by additional charges for other matters arising from the same acquisition 
the net credit to income in amounted to million 
the company also increased its estimate of costs to complete its restructuring by 
million and incurred million of termination costs for additional headcount reductions during after related income tax expense of million  these items reduced net income by approximately million or 
per share 
interest expense increased million for the year due to higher average debt levels  primarily to finance the retirement of class g preferred stock and also due to the alexander acquisition 
due to the factors described above and including the income of the discontinued operations  the company incurred a net loss of million in as compared with income of million before an extraordinary debt extinguishment loss in there was a minimal class g preferred stock dividend requirement in because most of the class g stock was retired at a 
million gain in the first quarter and all of the remaining class g stock was redeemed by july  liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of its capital expenditures  its technologies segment s trust fund payments  working capital needs and debt service obligations 
historically  the company has met such requirements with cash flows generated by operations and with additional debt financing 
the company expects capital expenditures of to million  primarily for equipment replacements  new services  development of additional landfill capacity and improvements to waste treatment facilities 
scheduled debt repayments amount to million in excluding million of revolving credit borrowings repaid in january 
technologies landfill permits require it to fund closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance obligations by making essentially non refundable trust fund payments 
these payments totaled million in based on current regulations  planned improvements to waste treatment facilities and permitted capacity  such payments are expected to amount to approximately million  including the reinvestment of idaho trust fund earnings that the company includes in interest income 
thereafter  such payments are not expected to exceed the reinvestment of trust fund earnings  based on current requirements 
the consolidated balance sheet reflects negative working capital of 
million at december   due to including in current liabilities million of revolving credit borrowings because they were repaid in january upon the sale of imsamet  the company applied the net proceeds to pay down bank borrowings and reduced the amount of its bank credit facility to million of revolving credit borrowing and letter of credit capacity 
in september  the company issued million of senior notes due  series b  having substantially the same terms as the company s existing million of senior notes due most of the net proceeds were used to pay off the outstanding balance on the company s bank credit facility that had been incurred to finance capital expenditures 
in conjunction with this transaction  the borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility was reduced to million  declining in each of january and the facility terminates in january as of december   million of revolving credit borrowings repaid in january and million of standby letters of credit were outstanding 
cash on hand  funds from operations and borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility are expected to satisfy the company s normal operating and debt service requirements through the term of the credit facility 
because its businesses are environmentally oriented  and therefore highly regulated  the company is subject to violations alleged by environmental regulators and  occasionally  fines 
such violations and fines have not had  and are not expected to have  a material impact on the company s business 
it is possible that the future imposition of additional environmental compliance requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  but the company is unable to predict any such future requirements 
see note o  in which environmental compliance is discussed 
year within the last two years  the company has purchased new software packages for most of its computer systems and is currently purchasing and implementing new software for the rest 
by early  all the company s software will either be designed to accommodate the year transition or upgraded through routine software releases from reliable software suppliers 
related costs are not expected to be significant
