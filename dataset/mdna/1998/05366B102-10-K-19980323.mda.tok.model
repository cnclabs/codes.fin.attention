based on the sale of businesses see notes and and the company s assessment  these amounts have been written off due to the uncertainty of recoverability in arbitration 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
financial resources and liquidity 
the company s working capital and operating needs are met through a combination of cash flow from operations and availability under revolving lines of credit 
the improved financial condition of the company resulting from the disposal of its nonstrategic business units enabled it to replace its existing senior secured credit facilities in september the company s current senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities consist of a million five year amortizing secured term loan due through the term loan  and a million five year secured revolving loan due in the revolver with availability determined by reference to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company 
the credit facilities provide significantly lower interest expense when compared with the previous amended senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain various covenants  including financial covenants  and limitations on debt  dividends and capital expenditures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during  the company repaid the credit facilities with proceeds received from the sale of businesses and borrowings under the credit facilities 
the credit facilities had been amended in march to provide for a maturity date of april   which resulted in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs in in january  a million subordinated note received in connection with the asset sale of the business aviation engine repair operation was repaid 
the company applied the proceeds as a permanent reduction of the term loan 
the subordinated note bore interest at per annum payable semiannually  and accrued interest of million was received by the company at the time of the note repayment 
because of the uncertainty regarding the collection of the note when it was received in march  the company carried the note at a discounted value of million 
the company believes that its expected cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving lines of credit are sufficient to meet its current working capital and operating needs as well as implement the share repurchase program that was announced in january improvements in earnings will further enhance the company s access to capital and will enable the company to finance future investment opportunities

environmental matters 
the company s parts distribution business  which includes parts repair operations  requires the use  storage and disposition of certain chemicals in small quantities which are regulated under various federal and state environmental protection laws 
these laws required the company to eliminate or mitigate the impact of these substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  the company has upgraded facilities and implemented programs to detect and minimize contamination 
due to the small quantities of chemicals used and the current programs in place  the company does not anticipate any material environmental liabilities or significant capital expenditures will be incurred in the future related to these operations to comply or remain in compliance with existing environmental regulations 
certain of the company s previously owned businesses see notes and to the consolidated financial statements required the use of certain chemicals classified by various state and federal agencies as hazardous substances 
the company retains environmental liabilities related to these businesses for the period during which they were operated by the company 
the company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup to comply with state and federal regulations at these locations 
the primary locations are burbank  california  dallas forest park  texas and commercial engine services properties ces properties which include three locations in texas love field  carter field and mcallen and one location in prestwick  scotland 
the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act at five third party disposal sites to which wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in the company s former engine services operations 
the company did not use these identified disposal sites 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although the company could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  it does not anticipate nonperformance 
based on this information  the company has not accrued any costs associated with third party sites 
the company has also received notices or inquiries from certain state agencies and other private parties with respect to certain other environmental matters 
one property owner adjacent to the previously owned forest park location has filed suit against the company related to environmental contamination 
these matters are in the preliminary stage of investigation  and the ultimate cost cannot presently be estimated 
in addition  the company s former burbank  california engine overhaul facility is located within the boundaries of the burbank unit of the san fernando valley superfund sites 
the epa has selected an interim remedial action for the burbank unit  including multiyear operation and maintenance of a ground water treatment system 
lockheed and certain other parties entered into a consent decree with the epa under which lockheed agreed to implement and finance a portion of the interim remedial action for a limited period 
in may  the company was notified by the epa that it had been named a prp with respect to the burbank unit 
in june  the company and certain other defendants entered into an agreement with lockheed to settle a lawsuit filed by lockheed in april against the company and more than other parties seeking recovery of or contribution to lockheed s response costs to comply with the consent decree 
pursuant to the agreement  in exchange for a million cash payment made in june  the company will be released from and protected against certain environmental response costs for the burbank unit through expiration of the interim remedy period established by the epa  certain claims by the epa for costs of oversight of the burbank unit and certain other matters 
the agreement does not cover certain matters including environmental response costs for any final remedy which may be established by the epa  certain epa oversight costs and costs of any changes mandated by the epa to the present interim remedy for the burbank unit 
the agreement with lockheed is subject to court approval of a new consent decree relating to the interim remedy for the burbank unit 
although the company presently believes that this condition will be satisfied  there can be no assurance of this event 
the company presently has determined additional reserves related to the burbank unit are not required due to the uncertainty of the additional costs  if any  associated with any changes to the interim remedy or any final remedy 
the company  together with approximately other parties  are defendants in eight separate lawsuits alleging personal injury and or property damage arising out of the alleged release of toxic substances into the air  soil and or groundwater in the city of burbank  california 
the damages for personal injuries claimed are broad and varied  and include cancer  fear of cancer  fear of injury  birth defects  reproductive harm  injuries to immune systems  future medical monitoring  emotional distress and loss of consortium 
in addition to aviall  the named defendants in these suits include lockheed and certain other parties who were named prps with respect to the burbank unit 
these cases  which were filed in the superior court of california for the county of los angeles and involve over  plaintiffs  have been consolidated for pretrial purposes 
the total damages claimed by the plaintiffs is not known although the jurisdictional allegations in the lawsuits seek damages in excess of  per plaintiff 
the company  which was served with these lawsuits in first quarter  intends to vigorously defend these suits 
since the suits are in the preliminary stage of investigation  no reserves for damages have been established 
the company is presently implementing a state agency approved cleanup for its former forest park facility 
the company believes existing financial reserves for the environmental remediation of this location are sufficient 
there are various stages of discussions underway with state agencies regarding the appropriate remediation for ground water and soil contamination at the ces properties located in texas 
the company has completed the state agency required remediation on soil and ground water issues for the carter field and mcallen locations 
during  investigations were completed at love field  texas and prestwick  scotland 
the company received notification of an approved plan from the scotland environmental protection agency on soil and ground water issues for the prestwick  scotland site 
work on determining exposure and corrective measures is continuing at the love field site 
based on current information  the company believes existing financial reserves for environmental corrective measures at the ces properties are sufficient 
in addition  the company is in litigation with a previous owner and former insurers of various of these locations as to their potential shared liability associated with the cleanup of these sites 
due to the uncertainty of recoverability of the various claims the company has made against these third parties and insurers  a receivable has not been recorded 
at december  and  accrued environmental liabilities amounted to million and million  respectively 
the company incurred million in for environmental expense 
no environmental expense was recorded in or the ultimate cost of the company s environmental liabilities has been estimated  including exit costs related to both commercial engine services and other previously owned businesses 
the company s estimates will change in the future as more information becomes available with respect to the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at the individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
the expected cash funding requirements for related to environmental liabilities are million 
the estimated environmental remediation expense to be recorded with respect to the ongoing business is not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future based on the nature of the activities presently conducted 
based on information presently available and company programs to detect and minimize contamination  management believes that the ultimate disposition of environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition although certain environmental matters could be material to cash flows in any one year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook 
aviall s focus is on the distribution of aviation parts and providing inventory information services 
the company completed the sales of nonstrategic business units and used the net proceeds to pay down debt 
management believes the company has made significant progress in streamlining corporate functions to reduce costs and improve efficiency 
the company intends to seek further opportunities for cost reductions and efficiency improvements in all areas of its operation 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program to buyback up to of the company s outstanding common stock over the next two years in open market transactions  depending on market  economic and other factors 
the company intends to use existing cash balances and future cash flows to fund this program 
management does not expect the share repurchase program to restrict the company from pursuing other opportunities for growth 
the company is in the process of replacing its financial and parts distribution operating software with planned implementation dates of second and fourth quarter of  respectively 
these implementations along with the new parts distribution warehouse and inventory management systems implemented in reflect management s commitment to improve the company s technology capabilities 
these new systems are year compliant 
also  ils internally developed software is being updated to be year compliant with a scheduled completion date of the second quarter the company has retained a consultant to conduct a year hardware review in the second quarter with recommendations to be implemented by year end based on the planned implementation and assessment dates  management believes implementation will be completed in a timely manner and there will be no material effect from year on its future financial results 
the company s financial and parts distribution operating systems are critical to aviall s success 
implementation of complex new software systems carries certain risks which may affect normal operations for a period of time 
management believes their implementation process and strategy combined with appropriate training throughout the organization will minimize these risks 
aviall primarily participates in the global aviation aftermarket through its core aviation parts distribution and inventory information services businesses 
the company can be affected by the general economic cycle  particularly as it influences flight activity in commercial  business and general aviation 
recent favorable economic conditions have led to a recovery of the aviation market  and provided the company with opportunities for growth 
the company serves a significant number of customers in the asia pacific and latin american regions 
recently  countries in these regions have experienced financial market volatility and the currencies of certain countries have fallen in value relative to the us dollar 
these factors may reduce demand for air travel in these regions  and as a result may affect customers need for aircraft parts and their ability to pay in a timely manner 
the company s ability to manage its inventory is affected by the relative efficiency of its suppliers 
also  changes in the company s portfolio of products and suppliers can result in periodic noncash charges to revalue inventory of discontinued products 
information and communication technology is evolving rapidly  and developments such as the internet could threaten proprietary database service companies such as ils and traditional distribution companies 
management believes that the active employment by the company of these new technologies  such as the internet  will enable it to maintain its technological leadership and minimize the risk of obsolescence
