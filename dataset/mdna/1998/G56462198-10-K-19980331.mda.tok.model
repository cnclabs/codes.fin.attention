and its subsidiaries 
as such  the following discussion compares these results of operations with the unaudited nine months ended december  old loral operated under a march year end 
the results of operations for the periods through march   include allocations and estimates of certain expenses of loral based upon estimates of actual services performed by old loral on behalf of loral 
the amount of corporate office expenses for such periods has been estimated based primarily on the allocation methodology prescribed by government regulations pertaining to government contractors  which management of loral believes is a reasonable allocation method 
for the periods through march   interest was allocated to loral based upon old loral s historical weighted average debt cost applied to the average investment in affiliates  which management of loral believes to be a reasonable allocation method 
interest related to old loral s investment in globalstar has been capitalized because globalstar has not commenced its principal operations 
the results of operations reflect net income of million for the nine months ended december  as compared with a loss of million for the same period in the prior year 
this change is primarily attributable to interest earned during on the investment of available cash balances as compared with interest expense allocated from old loral during total interest income  net for the nine months ended december  was million 
management fees earned from ss l of million for the nine months ended december  represent an increase of million over the nine months ended december  the management fees are based on ss l sales which increased million  or  to billion 
costs and expenses increased to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the nine months ended december  the primary reason for this increase is that expenses reflect the company s operation of its satellite and telecommunications businesses on a stand alone basis 
equity in net loss of affiliates decreased to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the comparable period in the prior year 
this improvement is primarily due to increased net income of ss l  partially offset by the loss of tax benefit for globalstar losses following loral s formation in bermuda 
the company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended december  was compared with for the prior period 
the current period effective rate is lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate because  as a bermuda company  a substantial portion of the company s income is foreign source income not subject to federal taxation 
summary results of operations of affiliates globalstar globalstar is a development stage partnership and has not commenced commercial service operations 
the net loss applicable to ordinary partnership interests for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the nine months ended december  the increase in the net loss is a result of increased marketing  general and administrative expenses of million and an increase in development costs of million as a result of increased activity in the development of globalstar s user terminals  offset by an increase in interest income of million as a result of higher average cash balances outstanding 
globalstar is expending significant funds for the construction  testing and deployment of the globalstar system and expects such losses to continue through commencement of revenue generating service operations 
satmex for the period november  to december   satmex had revenues  ebitda  operating income and a net loss of million  million  million and million  respectively unaudited 
the net loss is primarily attributed to interest expense of million on debt issued to finance the acquisition  which includes a charge for million of fees associated with a bridge loan 
satmex expects such losses to continue through until funds from operations reduce outstanding debt 
liquidity and capital resources loral intends to capitalize on its innovative capabilities  market position and advanced technologies to offer value added satellite based services as part of the evolving worldwide communications networks and  where appropriate  to form strategic alliances with major telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers to enhance and expand its satellite based communications service opportunities 
in order to pursue such opportunities  loral may seek funds from strategic partners and other investors  through incurrence of debt or the issuance of additional equity 
at december   loral had million of cash and cash equivalents 
loral intends to utilize its existing capital base and access to the capital markets to construct and operate additional satellites  make additional investments in globalstar and globalstar service provider opportunities and invest in additional satellite communications service opportunities 
on november   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary loral spacecom corporation  entered into a million credit facility with a group of banks see note to loral s consolidated financial statements 
the facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million letter of credit facility

the facility is secured by the stock of loral spacecom corporation and ss l and contains various covenants including an interest coverage ratio  debt to capitalization ratios and restrictions on cash transfers to its parent 
at december   there was million outstanding under this agreement and other similar credit agreements with ss l 
skynet skynet currently has two high powered satellites operating in orbit 
loral intends to expand skynet s business to become a worldwide satellite service provider through the construction of additional satellites and has four satellites under construction by ss l 
loral anticipates that a portion of the funds required for construction of these additional satellites will be provided through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional equity 
globalstar on february   globalstar launched its first four satellites 
globalstar expects to begin commercial service in early following the launch of satellites during the remaining satellites  including eight in orbit spares  will be launched in the first half of globalstar s current budgeted expenditures for the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system  including working capital  cash interest on borrowings and operating expenses is approximately billion 
as of december   globalstar had raised or received commitments for approximately billion 
in addition  globalstar has agreed to purchase from ss l eight additional spare satellites at a cost estimated at million 
further  in order to accelerate the deployment of gateways around the world globalstar has agreed to finance approximately million of the cost of up to of the initial gateways 
globalstar expects to recover this financing upon resale of such gateways to its partners and service providers 
ss l is the prime contractor for the design and construction of globalstar s satellites 
in connection therewith  ss l and its subcontractors have committed million of vendor financing to globalstar  of which million of such vendor financing is effectively borne by the subcontractors 
commitments and contingencies in connection with the merger between old loral and lockheed martin  lockheed martin assumed approximately million of the guarantee under the globalstar credit agreement 
the balance of million of the guarantee was assumed by various globalstar partners  including million by ss l 
loral has agreed to indemnify lockheed martin for its liability  if any  in excess of million under its guarantee of the globalstar credit agreement 
globalstar is currently financed without recourse to loral other than the indemnification described above 
in  two in orbit satellites built by ss l experienced solar array circuit failures 
one of the customers has asserted that  in light of the failures and uncertainty as to further failures  it has not accepted the satellite 
loral believes that the customer was contractually required to accept the satellite at completion of in orbit testing and that risk of loss has passed to the customer 
in addition  another customer has requested that ss l structure an arrangement whereby a satellite under construction would be sold to another customer 
management believes that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of loral
