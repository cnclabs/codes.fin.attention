refer to note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company s gross profit decreased to million or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the continued price erosion on the company s products partially offset by cost reductions resulting from improvements in manufacturing processes and inventory management

factors included in this cost reduction are reduced promotion and advertising expenditures  and cost savings related to restructurings in december and june during  selling  marketing  and distribution expenses increased to million from million in the prior year 
much of the increase was attributable to higher advertising and promotional expenses

risk factors and future trends forward looking statements statements which are not historical facts in this report are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements  including statements about product filings and approvals  raw material supply  net sales  price erosion  gross profit  research and development expenses  selling  marketing and distribution expenses  general and administrative expenses  recall related and litigation expenses  restructuring and other expenses  and interest expense  involve risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties detailed below  and actual results may differ significantly from those in any forward looking statements 
the company s future results of operations depend on its ability to obtain fda approval of andas for its new products  to procure a continuous supply of raw materials  to validate its manufacturing processes used to produce consistent test batches for fda approval and to receive continued customer acceptance of its products 
raw materials are generally available from several sources although this may not always be the case 
since the anda process requires specification of raw material suppliers  if raw materials from specified suppliers become unavailable  the company would be required to file a supplement to its product filing and revalidate the manufacturing process using a new supplier s materials 
this could cause a delay of several months in the manufacture of the drug involved and the consequent loss of potential revenue and market share 
additionally  there is often a time lag  sometimes significant  between the receipt of anda approval and the actual marketing of the approved product due to this validation process 
in the past year  there have been an increasing number of attempts to use federal legislation to extend the patent life of various drugs beyond the term permitted under current statutes 
although the generic drug industry thus far has been mostly successful in defeating these attempts at extending the monopoly of brand name drugs  the company could be adversely impacted if future legislation is enacted which extends the patent exclusivity of a number of drugs that are expected to come off patent in the coming years 
the company s future results of operations also may be affected by a variety of additional factors consistent with the nature of its business  including  but not limited to  changes in the intensity of competition affecting the company s products and customers 
generic products with limited competition are generally sold at higher prices  resulting in relatively high gross margins 
as multi source competition increases  selling prices and gross margins can decline dramatically and impair overall profitability 
brand name competitors are bundling the sale of generic and patented products as well as introducing generic versions of their own branded products prior to the expiration of the patents for such drugs  which is resulting in an increasing market share for these brand name competitors 
the company also has witnessed a consolidation of its customers  as chain drug stores and wholesalers merge or consolidate 
additionally  a number of the company s customers have instituted source programs which limit the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products 
management expects these trends and the resultant price erosion to continue 
the company will need to provide a continuous stream of new products and maintain its strong customer relations to offset these competitive pressures 
the company s gross margin continues to be depressed by the underutilization of its manufacturing facility 
the company  through its restructuring of operations begun in the fourth quarter of and continuing in  consolidated some of its facilities in an attempt to streamline its operations and took additional steps to reduce its overhead 
it is anticipated that the company s gross margin will continue to be depressed by the underutilization of its manufacturing facility during and until such time as the volume of manufactured products increases significantly 
continuing compliance with fda cgmp standards and applicable environmental regulations will also affect the company s future results of operations 
significant investments which increase the company s overhead need to be made from time to time to maintain the required infrastructure to comply with the fda cgmp standards 
the company has announced that it retained oppenheimer co 
to evaluate strategic alternatives including possible business alliances 
pursuing these strategic alternatives could divert management s attention and could result in significant costs to the company 
the governance agreement will expire on october  see expiration of the governance agreement below 
kenneth n 
larsen resigned as president of the company in january since that time  the board of directors has evaluated candidates for president of the company 
the albuterol related litigation and various other legal matters remain unresolved in part or in whole 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
although the company has established reserves it believes appropriate for these matters  the final outcome may exceed the estimates used in establishing those reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
year issues many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year and  therefore  computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional  this is the so called year problem 
the company s primary applications systems used to manage the manufacturing  shipment of product  control of inventory and performance of the accounting function have been vendor certified as year compliant and the company does not anticipate any material year issues with respect to these primary systems 
however  the company utilizes third party vendor network equipment  telecommunications products  manufacturing and testing equipment and other third party hardware and software products which may or may not be year compliant 
in addition  the company s customers and suppliers may or may not face serious year issues 
the company is formulating a plan to evaluate the impact of  and if necessary to remediate the impact of  the year issue on the company 
the company expects that its plan will be in place in the next several months and that its evaluation and remediation  if any  will be completed before the end of the company is not currently able to estimate the expenses it may incur in evaluating and remediating any year problems  but does not currently expect those expenses to be material 
costs and expenses of evaluating and remediating year issues will be expensed as they are incurred 
any failures of the company s internal systems or any significant interruptions of the business of its major suppliers or customers because of the year problem could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition  as well as result in significant expenses 
expiration of governance agreement in connection with hc s acquisition of a majority of the company s outstanding common stock in  the company and hc entered into a corporate governance and standstill agreement as amended  the governance agreement 
the purpose of the governance agreement was to provide limited protections to the minority shareholders by restricting certain actions hc would otherwise be legally able to take as the holder of the majority of the company s stock 
on october   the governance agreement will expire by its terms  with the exception of certain limited protections that will continue in force as described below 
some of the more significant protections in the governance agreement that will expire are a the requirement that the board of directors consist of nine members  three being company directors  three being hc directors and three being independent directors meaning jointly selected by the company directors and hc directors  and that committees of the board of directors be similarly constituted  b the prohibition against hc and its affiliates acquiring additional shares other than as necessary to maintain its pre existing percentage ownership or otherwise seeking to increase their control of ownership of the company without the company s consent including the consent of at least one company director  c the prohibition against amendments of the company s charter and by laws without the consent of at least one company director  d the requirement that hc vote its shares in accordance with all recommendations of the board of directors and not vote in opposition to any recommendation of the board of directors  e the requirement that all transactions between the company  on the one hand  and hc and its affiliates  on the other hand  and each transaction in which there is a potential conflict of interest between the company and its shareholders other than hc and its affiliates on the one hand  and hc or its affiliates on the other hand  must be approved by a majority of the independent directors  and f the requirement that hc not sell its shares to any person whom hc knows would own or more of the outstanding shares unless such person agrees in writing to be bound by the restrictions of the governance agreement and to forego certain benefits under the governance agreement 
the restrictions that continue in effect after october   are a the prohibition against hc or its affiliates acquiring shares of the company without the approval of a majority of the independent directors  except in certain privately negotiated  unsolicited transactions which do not reduce the liquidity of the shares below the level expected to be necessary to maintain a viable market for the shares and liquidity for the company s shareholders  and b the requirement that  so long as the company is a public company  the board of directors include at least three independent directors 
for these purposes  an independent director is a person who i is in fact independent  ii does not have any direct financial interest or any material indirect financial interest in hc or the company or any of their respective affiliates  and iii is not connected with hc or the company or any of their respective affiliates as an officer  employee  consultant  agent advisor  representative  trustee  partner  director other than of the company or person performing similar functions 
other than these limited restrictions and subject only to such fiduciary duties as a majority shareholder may have to minority shareholders under delaware law  hc  as a majority shareholder  will be able to exercise substantial control of the company  including the right to decide in its discretion most matters requiring shareholder approval  such as the election of future members of the board of directors and approval of any proposed merger or acquisition of the company 
the company is unable to predict what effect  if any  the expiration of the governance agreement will have on the company 
the expiration of the governance agreement could have an effect on the company s board of directors  management  business plan or consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the expiration of the governance agreement may make it easier for the company to be acquired by a third party or for hc and its affiliates to acquire the shares held by the minority shareholders 
the company is unable to predict the effect  if any  that the expiration of the governance agreement will have on the liquidity of the company s stock and its price 
capital resources and liquidity december  december  in millions cash and short term investments working capital long term debt shareholders equity working capital the company s combined cash and short term investments were million as of december  compared to million a year earlier 
the million increase primarily reflects million of cash generated from operations during offset by million of capital expenditures 
working capital increased million primarily from the reclassification of million of recall related and litigation expenses to long term liabilities refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the net income from operations adjusted for noncash expenditures 
during  the company spent million for machinery and equipment and facility enhancements as compared to million for the acquisitions primarily related to the development and manufacturing of new products 
during the year ended december   the company spent million for capital expenditures which included the million buy out of substantially all of its leased manufacturing and research and development equipment and the acquisition of parcels of land adjacent to the canton  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
these additions in all years were made from the cash generated from operations without incurring additional borrowing 
the company anticipates spending less than million for machinery and equipment acquisitions and facility enhancements during the year ending december  liquidity on august   the company amended its working capital line of credit agreement to replace one of its financial covenants related to profitability with a working capital covenant effective june  on july   the company amended its working capital line of credit agreement to increase its maximum borrowing capacity from million to million 
from time to time the company has been granted amendments and waivers to its credit agreements 
at december  the company had million in stand by letters of credit related to the albuterol settlement trust fund outstanding under this working capital line of credit agreement 
these stand by letters of credit were obtained by the company pursuant to the requirements of the albuterol settlement trust fund to cover its uninsured obligation 
recourse to the letters of credit are contingent upon the number of claims filed within certain categories and will not occur until all claims are processed and settlement amounts are recommended by the special master 
in february  the company s stand by letters of credit were reduced by million to reflect its additional cash deposits made pursuant to the august court order 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the settlement agreement 
the company continues to make annual payments of  on its outstanding industrial development revenue bonds the bonds  which are due in these bonds are secured by a letter of credit agreement 
effective december   the company received from its lender waivers to its credit agreements with respect to one of its financial covenants related to profitability 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain future waivers  if needed  the company s debt would be reclassified as short term debt and the company could lose its availability to cash under its line of credit 
the company believes that its current cash resources  cash generated from operations and the amount available under its amended working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating needs for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available at terms favorable or acceptable to the company  if at all
