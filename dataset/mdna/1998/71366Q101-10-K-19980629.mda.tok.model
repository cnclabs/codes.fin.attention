item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in  or incorporated by reference into  this report 
overview the company develops  markets  and supports an integrated suite of applications that automates the management of complex  enterprise wide information and infrastructure assets 
in  the company commenced sales of servicecenter  the company s enterprise service desk product suite 
during fiscal the company expanded the strategic concept of its product line implementing its infrastructure management strategy and executing on that strategy with its acquisition in september of united software  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiary apsylog sa apsylog acquisition 
as a result of the apsylog acquisition  the company acquired its assetcenter asset management product suite 
servicecenter and assetcenter are currently available for the windows nt and unix platforms  and servicecenter continue to be available for the mvs platform 
since the release of servicecenter in july  and until the apsylog acquisition  servicecenter accounted for substantially all of the company s license revenues 
since the apsylog acquisition  servicecenter and assetcenter together have accounted for substantially all of the company s license revenues 
in addition  for the year ended march   over of the company s license sales of servicecenter and assetcenter have been attributable to unix and windows nt platforms 
in the latter half of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal  the company implemented an internal restructuring to capitalize on the market opportunity for products addressing the requirements of the enterprise service desk 
this restructuring included rebuilding the company s senior management team  redefining the product development strategy  initiating a comprehensive marketing strategy and strengthening the company s financial and budgeting processes 
in addition  in april  the company substantially reorganized its sales force and instituted new sales management procedures 
during fiscal  the company determined that customer needs required a more comprehensive solution for control and management of their infrastructure assets  including availability of assets  minimizing investments and expense  consolidating data  and interfacing to enterprise applications 
accordingly  the company refocused its marketing strategy and product positioning to focus on this infrastructure management strategy 
the company s focus on the infrastructure management strategy  the company s rapid growth  and the apsylog acquisition have resulted in continuing efforts to rebuild the company s senior management team  redefine the product development strategy  establish a comprehensive marketing strategy  and strengthen the company s financial and budgeting processes 
the company s revenues are derived from product licensing  maintenance and services 
license fees are generally due upon the granting of the license and typically include a one year maintenance period as part of the license agreement 
the company also provides ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee based upon the current price of the product 
in fiscal   and  maintenance and services revenues represented   and of total revenues  respectively 
the company has sold its original pnms software to a sizable installed base of customers  many of whom have recently transitioned to servicecenter 
the company s installed customer base has generated a consistent level of maintenance revenues 
in fiscal   and  more than of the company s customers renewed their maintenance agreements 
revenues from license agreements are recognized currently  provided that all of the following conditions are met a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable  and no other significant vendor obligations exist 
revenues from post contract support services are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  generally one year 
maintenance revenues which are bundled with license agreements are unbundled using vendor specific objective evidence 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services most often performed on a time and material basis under separate service agreements for the installation of the company s products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the respective services are performed 
the company currently derives substantially all of its license revenues from the sale of servicecenter and assetcenter and expects them to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company s future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of the servicecenter and assetcenter product suites  including future enhancements 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of the servicecenter and assetcenter product suites  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company conducts business overseas in a number of foreign currencies  principally the british pound  the deutsche mark and the french franc 
these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or results of operations 
although the company currently derives no revenues from highly inflationary economies  the company is expanding its presence in international markets outside europe  including the pacific rim and latin america  whose currencies have tended to fluctuate more relative to the us dollar 
there can be no assurance that european currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has implemented a foreign currency forward hedging program 
the hedging program consists primarily of using day forward rate currency contracts 
currency contracts are in accordance with sfas no 
and receive hedge accounting treatment 
accordingly  to the extent properly hedged by obligations denominated in local currencies  the company s foreign operations remain subject to the risks of future foreign currency fluctuations  and there can be no assurances that the company s hedging activities will adequately protect the company against such risk 
to date the company s pacific rim sales activity has not been material 
accordingly  the company s operations and financial conditions have not been materially impacted by the recent asian financial crisis 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
march  statement of operations data revenues licenses maintenance and services total revenues costs and expenses cost of licenses cost of maintenance and services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income expense and other  net 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations 
loss from discontinued operations loss from operations loss on disposal loss from discontinued operations net income loss fiscal years ended march    and revenues total revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing year to year increases of between and and between and licenses 
license revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increases in license revenues are attributable to increased demand for new licenses of servicecenter and following the apsylog acquisition  licenses for assetcenter  additional seats purchased by existing servicecenter customers  higher average transaction sizes  more effective corporate marketing programs  improved sales force productivity  expansion of the company s domestic and international sales forces  and the effect of combining apsylog s operations since the apsylog acquisition in september maintenance and services 
maintenance and services revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases are attributable to renewals of maintenance agreements from the company s expanded installed base of customers and maintenance revenues included as part of new licenses and an increased number of consulting engagements related to implementation of software from initial license agreements 
costs and expenses cost of licenses 
cost of licenses revenues was   and  for fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total license revenues in the respective periods 
cost of maintenance and services 
cost of maintenance and services revenues was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total maintenance and services revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar and percentage increases in are attributable to an increase in customer support personnel and professional services personnel in connection with the corresponding increase in professional services revenue and the effect of combining apsylog s operations since the apsylog acquisition in september cost of maintenance and services increased as a percentage of related revenues because of increased labor costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases are attributable to the significant expansion of both the north american and international sales forces  increases in marketing personnel  the effect of combining apsylog s operations since the apsylog acquisition in september  and to moderate operating expense increases 
sales and marketing expenses have decreased as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal through fiscal as a result of revenues increasing at a faster rate 
if the company experiences a decrease in sales force productivity or for any other reason a decline in revenues  it is likely that operating margins will decline as well 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar and percentage decreases from fiscal to fiscal are due primarily to the full year effect of the company s divestiture of the entire mainframe software development portion of its business in october the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to the increased dollar amount of product author commissions  an increase in the number of personnel in the research and development department  and the effect of combining apsylog s operations since the apsylog acquisition in september research and development expenses have decreased as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal through fiscal as a result of revenues increasing at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increase from to is attributable primarily to costs associated with administrative personnel additions to support growth and  management restructuring  and the effect of combining apsylog s operations since the apsylog acquisition in september the decrease from fiscal to was attributable to the costs incurred in the fiscal management restructuring 
provision for income taxes income tax benefit the company did not incur any significant income taxes during fiscal due to operating losses 
in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million resulting from the utilization of a portion of the company s available net operating loss carryforwards as an offset against taxable income 
in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax expense of million 
as of march  and  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and million  respectively  for federal income tax purposes which expire beginning in utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations resulting from certain changes in ownership of the company 
at march   the company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to partially offset the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding its realization 
management evaluates on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the amount of the valuation allowance 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly 
any future decrease in the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction in goodwill 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company acquired xvt software inc xvt  substantially all of the outstanding equity of which was owned by the majority stockholder of the company 
in january  the company determined that maintaining an interest in xvt was not consistent with the company s business strategy and adopted a plan to discontinue the operations of xvt 
the company incurred a loss from discontinued operations of xvt in fiscal of million 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s financial position has not been significant to date 
liquidity and capital resources until april  the company financed its operations through bank borrowings and private sales of common stock 
in fiscal  the company received net proceeds from bank borrowings of million 
in fiscal  the company s net repayments totaled million 
in fiscal  the company received proceeds of  from the sale of a product line 
in fiscal and  the company invested cash in the amounts of million and  respectively  for purchases of property and equipment including computer hardware and software to support the company s growing employee base and to relocate to its new san diego headquarters and training facility 
in fiscal  the company generated  in cash from operations  but a net cash use of  by a discontinued business resulted in an overall cash use by the company of  in connection with operating activities 
in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations  which was reduced by a net cash use of million by a discontinued business resulting in million net cash provided from operations 
in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations  which was reduced by a net cash use of  by a discontinued business resulting in million net cash provided by operations 
in april  the company completed the initial public offering of its common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million 
the company has a million revolving credit line which expires july   pursuant to which there is no outstanding balance at march  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at march  
the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable  equipment  and certain other assets of the company 
the borrowing facility also provides for a foreign exchange facility  under which the maximum principal amount of foreign exchange transactions which may mature during any two day period is million 
the company believes that the net proceeds from its initial public offering in april  together with its current cash and short term investments balances  cash available under its bank facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or which may be dilutive 
year risks many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant and is conducting an internal audit of products provided by outside vendors to determine if such third party products are year compliant 
although such audit is not yet completed  the company has received assurances from suppliers of all third party software that the company deems material to its business that such software is year compliant 
failure of such third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
if key systems  or a significant number of systems  were to fail as a result of year problems or if the company was to experience delays implementing year compliant software products  the company could incur substantial costs and disruption of its business  which would potentially have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial conditions 
the company is still assessing the impact the year issue will have on its proprietary software products and internal information systems and will take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such analyses 
management of the company has not yet determined the costs related to achieving year compliance but does not believe such costs will be material 
to the extent the cost of achieving year compliance are material  such costs will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company tests and evaluates its own software products and believes that its software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not materially affect the performance of such software products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability of such products to correctly create  store  process  and output information related to such data 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will not subsequently learn that certain of its software products do not contain all necessary software routines and codes necessary for the accurate calculation  display  storage  and manipulation of data involving dates 
in addition  in certain circumstances  the company has warranted that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of its products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability to create  store  process  and output information related to such data 
if any licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages 
in addition  the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statement and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including the following history of operating losses 
through march   the company has recorded cumulative net losses of approximately million  including approximately million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the apsylog acquisition 
in recent years  the product lines of both the company and apsylog have changed substantially 
the company s servicecenter product  from which the company derived substantially all of its license revenues until the acquisition of assetcenter  only began shipping in mid apsylog s assetcenter product only began shipping in mid as a result  prediction of the company s future operating results is difficult  if not impossible 
although the company achieved profitability during the years ended march  and excluding the impact of the million charge related to acquired in process research and development in connection with the apsylog acquisition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company does not believe that the growth in revenues it has experienced in recent years is indicative of future revenue growth or future operating results 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results  lengthy sales cycle  seasonality 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  among others  i the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of its software on a timely basis  ii market demand for the company s software  iii the size  timing and contractual terms of significant orders  iv the timing and significance of new software product announcements or releases by the company or its competitors  v changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  vi changes in the company s business strategies  vii budgeting cycles of its potential customers  viii changes in the mix of software products and services sold  ix changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  x the impact of acquisitions of competitors  xi seasonal trends  xii the cancellations of licenses or maintenance agreements  xiii product life cycles  xiv software defects and other product quality problems  xv and personnel changes 
the company has historically operated with little or no backlog and has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or weeks of that quarter 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing of revenue recognition can be affected by many factors  including the timing of contract execution and delivery 
the timing between initial customer contact and fulfillment of criteria for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
in the event of any downturn in potential customers businesses or the economy in general  planned purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the license of the company s software generally requires the company to engage in a sales cycle that typically takes approximately six to nine months to complete 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which the company may have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition which the company encounters in its selling activities 
in addition  the sales cycle is typically extended days for product sales through indirect channels 
during the sales cycle  the company typically provides a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the company s products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
the company s revenues and operating results in its december quarter typically benefit from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements  while revenues and operating results in the march quarter typically benefit from the efforts of the company s sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
in addition  the company is currently attempting to expand its presence in international markets  including europe  the pacific rim and latin america 
international revenues comprise a significant percentage of the company s total revenues  and the company may experience additional variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in such foreign markets 
in particular  the quarter ended september tends to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity  particularly in europe 
product concentration 
the company currently derives substantially all of its license revenues from the sale of its servicecenter and assetcenter suites of applications and expects them to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of servicecenter and assetcenter  including future enhancements 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of servicecenter or assetcenter  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
dependence on market acceptance of infrastructure management software solutions 
until recently  the company s product strategy has focused on integrating a broad array of it management applications with other traditional internal help desk applications to create an enterprise service desk capable of managing multiple aspects of an enterprise s it structure 
in recent years  the company s license revenues have derived principally from sales of its servicecenter suite of it management applications 
in september  the company broadened its it infrastructure management product suite by acquiring assetcenter  an asset management product line  through the apsylog acquisition 
in addition  the company has increased the functionality of servicecenter to manage aspects of the enterprise infrastructure not necessarily related to it 
in may  the company announced that it had entered a definitive agreement to acquire innovative tech systems  inc  a provider of facilities management software innovative 
innovative s product strategy has focused on providing building and facilities management software applications and its license revenues have consisted entirely of sales of its span fm application suite 
in acquiring innovative  the company intends to further broaden its product line beyond traditional it infrastructure management to offer a more comprehensive product suite capable of managing a business enterprise s it infrastructure  its physical plant and facilities  its communications infrastructure  and its distribution systems 
in recent years  the market for enterprise software solutions has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product announcements and introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in response to advances in technology  customer requirements have become increasingly complex  resulting in industry consolidation of product lines offering similar or related functionality 
in particular  the company believes that a market for integrated enterprise wide infrastructure management solutions  including applications for it management  asset management  building and facilities management  communications resource management  and distribution systems management  is evolving from existing requirements for specific it management solutions 
nevertheless  the existence of such a market is unproven 
any failure of such a market to develop would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
regardless of the development of a market for integrated infrastructure management solutions  factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of one or more of servicecenter or assetcenter  or  if the acquisition of innovative is completed  span fm  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
integration of innovative tech systems into the company s business 
the acquisition of innovative is anticipated to close in the company s september quarter  subject to approval by shareholders of innovative and certain other conditions 
the acquisition will require integration of two geographically separated companies that have previously operated independently 
the company believes that the acquisition will further its strategy to provide customers with a complete infrastructure management software solution 
no assurance can be given that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating the product offerings and operations of the company  that the company will successfully complete and commercialize new products currently in development or develop any new products  that the marketing  distribution  or other operational benefits and efficiencies anticipated from integration of the respective businesses and products of the company will be achieved  or that employee morale will not be adversely affected as a result of the acquisition and the resulting integration 
such integration could result in a diversion of management s time and attention  which could have a material adverse effect on revenues and results of operations at either or both of the company 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations or of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and different corporate cultures 
there can be no assurance that either company will retain its key personnel  that the combined engineering teams will successfully cooperate and realize any technological benefits  that they will benefit from the broader distribution and marketing opportunities available through the company or that the company will benefit from the broader product offerings available  or that the company will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
any failure to integrate the businesses and technologies of the companies successfully or any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
in addition  the public announcement or consummation of the acquisition could result in the cancellation  termination  or nonrenewal of arrangements with innovative s suppliers  distributors  or customers  or the loss of certain key employees  or the termination of negotiations or delays in ordering by prospective customers of innovative as a result of uncertainties that may be perceived to result from the acquisition 
for example  customers or potential customers of innovative who utilize enterprise service desk  asset management  or other infrastructure management software  including help desk software  marketed by competitors of innovative could terminate or delay orders due to perceived uncertainties over innovative s continued commitment to provide products and enhancements or support services for its products used in conjunction with such competing enterprise software 
any significant amount of cancellations  terminations  delays  or nonrenewals of arrangements with either company or loss of key employees or termination of negotiations or delays in ordering could have a material adverse effect on innovative s business  results of operations  and financial condition of either company  particularly in the quarter ending july  and other near term quarters 
risks associated with other peregrine acquisitions 
in addition to the apsylog acquisition and the acquisition of innovative  the company may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  and technologies and that further the company s strategy of providing an integrated infrastructure management software solution 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will make any additional acquisitions in the future 
any such future acquisitions or investments would present risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the technology  operations  or personnel of the acquired business  the potential disruption of the company s on going businesses  the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through the successful incorporation of acquired personnel  clients  or technologies  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 
the company expects that future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of company common stock  or a combination of cash and company common stock 
in the event of such an acquisition or investment  the factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operation  and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel  ability to recruit personnel 
the company s success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of its senior management and certain other key employees of the company  including selected sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
none of the company s employees  including its senior management  is bound by an employment or non competition agreement  and the company does not maintain key man life insurance on any employee 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key employees or the decision of one or more of such officers or employees to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  several of the company s executive officers  including its president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and certain operating vice presidents  have been employed by the company for a relatively short period of time 
since joining the company  the new management team has devoted substantial effort in refocusing the company s product  sales and marketing strategies 
in connection with such changes  the company restructured its sales and marketing departments  which resulted in the replacement of a significant number of employees 
although management believes that this restructuring has benefited the company  many of the company s current employees have been with the company for only a limited period of time 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales  management and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and the company has at times in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
new employees hired by the company generally require substantial training in the use and implementation of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to achieve anticipated revenues is also dependent in part upon its ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries 
any future shortage of qualified technical personnel who are either united states citizens or otherwise eligible to work in the united states could increase their reliance on foreign professionals 
many technology companies have already begun to experience shortages of such personnel 
any failure to attract and retain qualified personnel as necessary  including as a result of limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas issued thereunder  could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the company 
in particular  foreign computer professionals such as the type utilized by the company typically become eligible for employment by obtaining a nonimmigrant visa commonly known as an h b 
the immigration act of limits the number of available h b visas to  per year 
this limitation was reached for the first time approximately one month prior to the federal government s fiscal year ending september  in a notice published on may   the immigration and naturalization service announced that the  annual limitation on h b visas had already been reached for the federal government s fiscal year ending september  as a result  computer professionals from other countries who need an h b visa in order to be eligible for employment will not be eligible for employment in the united states until after october  at the earliest 
currently  legislation is pending in the united states congress which  if passed in its present form  would increase the number of h b visas available 
it is impossible to predict whether such legislation will ultimately become law 
likewise  it is impossible to predict what effect any future changes in the federal immigration laws will have on the business  results of operations  or financial condition of the company 
competition 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive  fragmented and subject to rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the company encounters competition from a number of sources  including i providers of internal help desk software applications such as remedy corporation and software artistry  inc now a division of tivoli  ii customer interaction software companies such as clarify inc and the vantive corporation  whose products include internal help desk applications  iii information technology and systems management companies such as ibm  computer associates  network associates  inc recently formed as a result of the business combination of mcafee associates  inc and network general corporation  and hewlett packard through its acquisition of prolin  iv providers of asset management software  and v the internal information technology departments of those companies with help desk requirements 
because barriers to entry in the software market are relatively low  the company anticipates additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the market for enterprise infrastructure management applications expands 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  or large software companies could acquire or establish alliances with smaller competitors of the company 
the company expects software industry consolidation to continue in the future  and it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
for example  the company s ability to sell its products depends in part on their compatibility with and support by providers of system management products  including tivoli  computer associates  and hewlett packard 
both tivoli and hewlett packard have recently acquired providers of help desk software products 
the decision of one or more providers of system management products to close their systems to competing vendors like the company  or to bundle their infrastructure management and or help desk software products with other products for enterprise licenses for promotional purposes or as part of a long term pricing strategy  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products 
increased competition  including increased competition as a result of acquisitions of help desk and other infrastructure management software vendors by system management companies  is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
some of the company s current and many of its potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
management of growth 
the company s business has grown substantially in recent periods  with total revenues increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal if the company is successful in achieving its growth plans  including the integration of apsylog and innovative tech  such growth is likely to place a significant burden on the company s operating and financial systems  resulting in increased responsibility for senior management and other personnel within the company 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  and its future operating results will depend in part on the ability of its officers and other key employees to implement and expand operational  customer support and financial control systems and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
in particular  in connection with the acquisitions  the company will be required to integrate additional personnel and to augment or replace innovative s existing financial and management systems 
such integration could result in a disruption of operations of the company and could adversely affect the financial results of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing management or any new members of management will be able to augment or improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to future growth  if any 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
expansion of distribution channels 
the company has historically sold its products through its direct sales force and a limited number of distributors and has provided maintenance and support services through its technical and customer support staff 
in addition to continuing to invest in its direct sales force  particularly in north america where it has recently opened several new sales offices  the company is currently investing and intends to continue to invest significant resources in developing additional sales and marketing channels through system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems and other channel partners 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract channel partners that will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
to the extent the company establishes distribution through such indirect channels  its agreements with channel partners may not be exclusive and such channel partners may also carry competing product lines 
any failure by the company to establish and maintain such distribution relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
international operations  currency fluctuations 
international sales represented approximately and of the company s total revenues in both fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company currently has international sales offices in london  paris  frankfurt  munich  amsterdam and copenhagen 
the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require continued expansion of its international operations  particularly in europe  latin america and the pacific rim 
accordingly  the company intends to expand its international operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
in addition  the company s international operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  longer payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies  and trade barriers imposed by foreign countries  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in particular  recent instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets  could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results in future quarters 
in addition  the company has only limited experience in developing localized versions of its products and marketing and distributing its products internationally and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully localize  market  sell and deliver its products internationally 
the inability of the company to expand its international operations successfully and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which the company conducts its business relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience currency losses in the future 
the company has recently implemented a foreign exchange hedging program  consisting principally of purchases of one month forward rate currency contracts 
notwithstanding such a program  there can be no assurances that the company s hedging activities will adequately protect the company against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
issues related to the european monetary conversion 
on january   certain member states of the european economic community the eec will fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro 
on that day  the euro will become a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the next three years  business in these eec member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in eec member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
the company s assetcenter product was originally developed for the european market and is capable of managing currency data measured in euros 
the company is still assessing the impact that the euro will have on its internal systems and the other products it sells  however 
the company will take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
the company has not yet determined the costs related to addressing this issue  and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
rapid technological change and product development risks 
the markets for the company s products are subject to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon its ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products 
the company s product development efforts are expected to continue to require substantial investments 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the company has in the past experienced development delays  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such delays in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such products will achieve market acceptance  or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
the inability of the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors that may be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its products and has experienced delays in shipment of products during the period required to correct these errors 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found  resulting in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  injury to their reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the success of the company will be  heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which provide only limited protection 
despite precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of its current or future products or to obtain and use information that either regards as proprietary 
in particular  the company may provide its respective licensees with access to its data model and other proprietary information underlying its licensed applications 
there can be no assurance that such means of protecting their proprietary rights will be adequate or that their competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and  while the company is able to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the proprietary rights of the company to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce their intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of any or all of the company 
the company is not aware that any of its software product offerings infringes the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement with respect to current or future products of the company 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in their industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
product liability 
the license agreements which the company enters with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of their products may entail the risk of such claims  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect on its respective businesses  results of operations  and financial condition 
control by existing stockholders 
based on shares outstanding as of may   the company s officers  directors and their affiliates together beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of the company common stock 
in particular  john j 
moores  chairman of the company board  owns approximately of the outstanding shares of the company common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to control most matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the company 
this may prevent or discourage potential bids to acquire the company unless the terms of acquisition are approved by such stockholders 
effect of certain company charter provisions  limitation of liability of directors  antitakeover effects of delaware law 
the company is authorized to issue  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
the company board has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof  including dividend rights  dividend rates  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting a series or the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by peregrine s stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of the company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
the company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and specify certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
such provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the company board and in the policies formulated by the company board and to discourage certain types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of control of the company 
such provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability of the company to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the company s shares and  consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in the management of the company 
the company is subject to section of the delaware general corporation law the antitakeover law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
the antitakeover law prevents certain delaware corporations  including those whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of the antitakeover law  a business combination includes  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving peregrine and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than of the company s assets 
in general  the antitakeover law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover law with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from amendments approved by the holders of at least a majority of the company s outstanding voting shares 
the company has not opted out of the provisions of the antitakeover law

the market price of the company s common stock has been subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price and volume fluctuations pending the anticipated acquisition of innovative 
in addition  following the acquisition  the company common stock can be expected to be subject to significant price and volume fluctuations 
a number of factors could affect the market price of the respective companies securities before the acquisition and the market price of company common stock after the acquisition 
these factors include any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts  announcements of new products by one of the companies or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of direct competitors of the company or innovative  changes in analysts estimates of the company s financial performance  the financial performance of competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  general conditions in the software industry  changes in prices for products of the company or products of competitors  changes in revenue growth rates for the company  or its competitors  sales of large blocks of company common stock  and conditions in the financial markets in general 
in addition  the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  which particularly affect the market price for the securities of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
there can be no assurance that market prices of the company common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future
