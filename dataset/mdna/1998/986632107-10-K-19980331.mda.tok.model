item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
historical financial information has been restated to reflect the acquisition of elder davis  inc in july  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
further  the financial information has been reclassified to include certain warehouse and delivery expenses  previously included in cost of sales  with selling  general and administrative expenses  and to report such expenses as other operating expenses 
the company believes that this presentation more appropriately reflects its cost structure as it expands its sales and distribution operations 
general the company is the second largest casket manufacturer in the united states and produces a wide variety of caskets  as well as casket components and burial vaults 
the company s finished caskets are marketed through a network of company and privately owned distributors  which serve an estimated  domestic funeral homes  as well as certain foreign markets 
casket components are sold to other casket manufacturers and assemblers including certain of the company s distributors 
burial vaults are sold directly to funeral home and cemetery operators as well as to privately owned distributors 
in certain markets  the company believes that its privately owned distributors will continue to be the most effective way to market the company s products and expects to continue to strongly support the efforts of these privately owned distributors 
however  the company has  and will continue to  acquire certain of its distributors if the company believes that such acquisitions would be complementary and result in operating efficiencies 
during  the company acquired distribution companies serving southeast and southwest united states and northern california markets 
the company already owned distribution operations serving new england and certain midwest markets 
in april  the company completed an initial public offering the offering of  shares of its common stock 
proceeds to the company from the offering  net of associated costs  were approximately million 
the company used million of the proceeds to repay the subordinated series a note the series a note in the second quarter of the balance of the proceeds was available for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
funeral homes are required by federal regulation to provide price lists to their customers  and generally publish such price lists annually 
as a result  the casket manufacturing industry has established the industry wide practice of setting its prices every january 
in setting these prices  the company considers expected raw material prices  competitive considerations  the general state of the economy and inflationary expectations 
this industry practice requires the company to set its prices in anticipation of  rather than in response to  changes in raw material and other costs 
over the past three years  the company s annual weighted average price increases have ranged from to 
limitations on the timing of price increases relative to changes in costs may cause fluctuations in operating margins  and therefore  make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
the major domestic casket manufacturers have all developed discount and rebate programs  which are commonplace in the casket manufacturing industry  designed to encourage volume purchases by funeral homes 
in the case of the company  these discounts are absorbed equally between the company and the distributors

selected quarterly operating results and seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced seasonal variations 
generally  the company s net sales are highest in the first quarter and lowest in the third quarter of each year 
these fluctuations are due in part to the seasonal variance in the death rate  with a greater number of deaths generally occurring in cold weather months  and the timing of the company s annual manufacturing facility vacation shutdowns  which occur primarily in the third quarter 
in addition  operating results can vary between quarters of the same or different years due to  among other things  fluctuations in the number of deaths  changes in product mix  and the timing of annual price increases relative to changes in costs 
as a result  the company experiences variability in its operating results on a quarterly basis  which may make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful
