certain of the statements that follow are forward looking and relate to anticipated future operating results 
statements which look forward in time are based on management s current expectations and assumptions  which may be affected by subsequent developments and business conditions  and necessarily involve risks and uncertainties 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ materially from anticipated results 
although the company has attempted to identify some of the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  those factors should not be viewed as the only factors which may affect future operating results 
overview the company operates in two segments multimedia distribution  which consists of occ and ans  and entertainment  which consists of the denver nuggets  the colorado avalanche  the arena company  and beacon 
multimedia distribution the company made its initial investment in occ in and owned approximately of ocv prior to the acquisition 
as a result of consummating the acquisition  the company owned approximately approximately on a fully diluted basis of the outstanding common stock of occ 
prior to the acquisition  ocv had experienced rapid growth in the prior three and one half years  increasing its base of installed rooms from approximately  rooms in approximately hotels at the end of to approximately  rooms in approximately  hotels at october conversely  spectravision  as a result of financial constraints and its bankruptcy filing in june  had experienced deterioration in its room base over the same period 
spectravision s room base  including both pay per view and free to guest  had decreased from approximately  installed rooms in approximately  hotels at the end of to approximately  rooms  including both pay per view and free to guest  in approximately  hotels at october during the third quarter of  management of the company decided to discontinue satellite cinema s scheduled movie operations and focus primarily on the business and luxury hotels served by ocv s on demand technology 
in december  certain assets and contracts relating to satellite cinema customers were sold by ocv to skylink communications skylink 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective october   the company  through occ  acquired the assets and certain liabilities of spectravision  which assets included a certain number of scheduled only rooms 
during the third quarter of  occ assigned to skylink operating rights and sold assets associated with approximately  spectravision rooms located in the us and canada 
the following table sets forth information with regard to pay per view rooms installed as of december rooms percent rooms percent rooms percent on demand    scheduled    it is expected that the company will continue to derive a majority of its consolidated revenues from occ 
revenue and income growth are anticipated from the continued installation of on demand systems for new hotel customers and systems serving existing spectravision customers 
the primary sources of revenues of occ which are more fully discussed below are movie rentals  video games  free to guest services and video system sales 
the company projects that the conversion of hotel rooms acquired in the acquisition to occ s on demand technology  as well as the continued upgrading and expansion of the products and services offered by occ  may require capital expenditures of approximately to million during through ans  the company provides satellite distribution support services  principally to the nbc television network for which it is the primary provider 
in  ans entered into the ten year nbc agreement to design  build  operate and support its satellite distribution network 
in  ans and nbc extended the term of the nbc agreement to in addition  in august  the company and nbc executed a letter of intent pursuant to which the company has procured and installed certain digital technology equipment and has agreed to provide msnbc  llc  a joint venture between nbc and microsoft corporation msnbc  with network service  maintenance and support 
this partial digital upgrade service  governed by the underlying nbc agreement  is being provided for a year term 
ans and msnbc currently anticipate finalizing a service agreement separate from the underlying nbc agreement in the first half of for the msnbc partial digital upgrade service 
the network service  maintenance and support provided to msnbc are related to and dependent upon the original nbc distribution network 
the company anticipates that ans will assist nbc in completing the upgrade of the nbc distribution network to digital technology  although no assurance can be provided in this regard 
expenditures by ans which would be associated with such digital upgrade in the event of such renewal are estimated at approximately million  substantially all of which are currently expected to be financed through operating leases  and would be accompanied by an extension of the nbc agreement 
no assurance can be provided that such agreement will be extended and  if extended  on what terms 
the company anticipates that the contract to complete the digital upgrade for nbc will be awarded in the fourth quarter of and accordingly  the timing of the expenditures may vary 
entertainment the company made its initial investment in the nuggets  one of franchises in the nba  in with the acquisition of a interest in a limited partnership that acquired the nuggets 
in and  the company acquired the remaining interests in the partnership 
in july of  the company acquired the avalanche  one of franchises in the nhl  at a cost of approximately million 
the company moved the franchise to denver to share denver s mcnichols arena with the nuggets  where the team commenced play under the colorado avalanche name in the season 
based on the timing of the avalanche acquisition  the company s results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of the avalanche only for the last six months 
the financial performance of the nuggets and the avalanche are  to a large extent  dependent on their performance in their respective leagues 
in addition  due to the limitation of the facilities available at mcnichols arena  the company expects the avalanche and the nuggets to continue to experience operating losses as long as both teams play in mcnichols arena 
on november   the arena company entered into the arena agreement with the city  pursuant to which ascent will construct  own and operate the pepsi center in which the nuggets and avalanche would play beginning in the nhl and nba playing seasons 
as a result of the nuggets and the avalanche playing in the pepsi center and ascent operating the pepsi center for live events  completion of the pepsi center is expected to result in increased revenues and improved operating results for the company s entertainment segment 
in december of  ascent acquired the assets of beacon  a film and television production company based in los angeles 
the cost of this acquisition was  which consisted of  in cash and liabilities assumed of  since the acquisition of beacon  beacon has produced four motion pictures including air force one  a thousand acres  and playing god which were released in seasonality  variability and other the company s businesses are subject to the effects of both seasonality and variability 
the multimedia distribution segment revenues  and primarily those of occ  are influenced principally by hotel occupancy rates and the buy rate or percentage of occupied rooms at hotels that buy movies or other services at the property 
higher revenues are generally realized during the summer months and lower revenues realized during the winter months due to business and vacation travel patterns which impact the lodging industry s occupancy rates 
buy rates generally reflect the hotel s guest mix profile  the popularity of the motion picture or services available at the hotel and the guests other entertainment alternatives 
the entertainment segment revenues are influenced by various factors 
revenues for the nuggets and the avalanche correspond to the nba and nhl playing seasons  which extend from the fall to late spring depending on the extent of each team s post season playoff participation 
accordingly  the company realizes the vast majority of its revenues from the nuggets and the avalanche during such period 
beacon s revenues fluctuate based upon the delivery and or availability of the films it produces  the timing of theatrical and home video releases and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior 
release and delivery dates for theatrical products are determined by several factors  including the distributor s schedule  the timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market 
specifically  beacon delivered and released three motion pictures during the year ended december   air force one was delivered and released in july  a thousand acres was delivered and released in september  and playing god was released domestically in october and was delivered to certain of its foreign distributors during the year ended december  accordingly  beacon s revenues have significantly increased during the year ended december  as compared to prior years 
furthermore  beacon s operating results are significantly affected by accounting policies required for the film and entertainment industry and management s estimates of the ultimate realizable value of its films 
production advances received prior to delivery or completion of a film are treated and recorded as deferred income and are generally recognized as revenues on the date the film is delivered or made available for delivery 
the company generally capitalizes all costs incurred to produce a film 
such costs include the acquisition of story rights  the development of stories  the direct costs of production  print and advertising costs  production overhead and interest expense relating to financing the project 
capitalized exploitation or distribution costs include those costs that clearly benefit future periods such as film prints and prerelease and early release advertising that is expected to benefit the film in future periods 
these costs  as well as participation and talent residuals  are amortized each period under the individual film forecast method  which uses the ratio that the current period s gross revenues from all sources for the film bear to management s estimate of anticipated total gross revenues for such film from all sources 
in the event management reduces its estimates of the future gross revenues associated with a particular item or product  which had been expected to yield greater future proceeds  a write down and a corresponding decrease in the company s earnings for the quarter and fiscal year end in which such write down is taken could result and could be material 
as a result of the operating losses expected to be incurred by occ  the avalanche and the nuggets  the company expects to incur operating losses on a consolidated basis during however  the company expects to record positive earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization and positive operating cash flows during this period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of revenues for the period indicated amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands income statement data revenues multimedia distribution   entertainment   total   cost of services   depreciation and amortiza   general and administrative   operating loss   other income expense  net interest expense   income tax benefit   minority interest   extraordinary loss  net net loss   revenues revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  multimedia distribution revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase in the multimedia distribution revenues is attributable to a million increase in revenues at occ 
the increase in revenues at occ was due to a larger number of hotel rooms served  resulting primarily from the acquisition in october occ s revenues in were also affected by a satellite outage in january affecting certain spectravision properties and the termination and sale of approximately  rooms during the second half of that were receiving pay per view programming delivered exclusively by satellite 
management of occ believes these two events reduced multimedia distribution revenues in by approximately million to million 
entertainment revenues increased by million in primarily as a result of an increase in revenues at beacon of million 
the increase in revenues at beacon is due to the recognition of million in revenues from the release and delivery of three motion pictures to their distributors during specifically  beacon recognized revenues of million from the release of air force one which includes beacon s share of the net box office results through december  and million which is attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues upon delivery of the film to its foreign distributor  million from the delivery and domestic release of a thousand acres and revenues of million from the delivery and release of the motion picture playing god 
in contrast  during the year ended december   beacon recognized revenues of million from the home video release of the motion picture  the babysitter s club 
in addition  during the year ended december   the avalanche realized increased revenues of million from regular season ticket sales  sponsorship sales  local broadcast revenues  and increased playoff and preseason revenues in spite of playing fewer home games as compared to however  the increases in revenues from the avalanche were partially offset by declining revenues from the nuggets as compared to cost of services cost of services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the overall increase in cost of services is attributable to an increase in film amortization costs at beacon of million  primarily from air force one  and increased costs at occ due to the overall increase in number of rooms served 
cost of services for multimedia distribution was million  or of multimedia distribution revenues for the year ended december  compared to million  or of multimedia distribution revenues for the year ended december  the decline in multimedia distribution margin is primarily attributable to an increase in cost of services at occ and a lower recovery of free to guest programming costs provided to hotels 
the increase in cost of services at occ is primarily due to higher royalties on feature movies  higher hotel commission expenses on spectravision rooms  and an increase in field service costs in order to support the acquired spectravision equipment and expenses associated with the satellite outage  as discussed previously 
in addition  occ has incurred additional costs in in the development of its new digital technologies  for activities to integrate spectravision and occ s operational systems and the expansion of its international presence 
partially offsetting the declining margin at occ was an increase in margin at ans  which is attributable to ancillary sales of higher margin services in and labor cost savings 
cost of services for entertainment was million  or of entertainment revenues for the year ended december  compared to million  or of entertainment revenues for the year ended december  the improved margin at entertainment is primarily attributable to results from air force one  and to a lesser degree  improved operating results at the avalanche from higher revenues 
lower revenues and higher costs with respect to the nuggets  resulting primarily from increased team costs related to contract terminations  partially offset entertainment s improved margin 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization for multimedia distribution was million  or of multimedia distribution revenues for the year ended december   compared to million  or of multimedia distribution revenues for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a higher installed room base and the resulting increase in depreciation at occ  combined with the incremental depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition in october depreciation and amortization for entertainment was million  or of entertainment revenues for the year ended december   compared to million  or of entertainment revenues for the year ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses  which include only those costs incurred by the parent company  ascent entertainment group  inc  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this decrease primarily reflects the reduction of approximately million in certain general and administrative service charges from comsat and the non recurrence of moving  relocation and other travel costs incurred in offset by increased professional services costs associated with the distribution  the recognition of expense during for the company s stock appreciation rights  and an increase in employment related costs necessary to support the company s continued growth 
from january through june  comsat provided only limited administrative and support services to the company and  since july has provided none 
other income expense other income expense decreased by approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in other expenses during is attributable to occ s recognition of a  loss on its investment in maginet during the fourth quarter of while the company recognized million in losses on its limited partnership investment in elitch gardens during  these losses were substantially offset by a gain of million from the sale of investment securities and other interest income recognized during elitch gardens  a denver amusement park  was sold in october interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this increase is attributable to the additional borrowings incurred during the fourth quarter of primarily the assumption of debt in the acquisition and throughout for capital expenditures  investment requirements and the funding of operating requirements of the company and its subsidiaries  and to a lesser degree  an increase in financing costs as a result of the amendment to the former ascent credit facility in march and debt issuance costs associated with the company s senior secured discount notes the notes issued in december income taxes the company recorded an income tax benefit of million during the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  up to and until the distribution from comsat on june   the company was able to recognize tax benefits from its operating losses as part of its inclusion as a member of the consolidated tax group of comsat 
accordingly  the company recognized a tax benefit of million from its operating losses during the first half of however  this benefit was partially offset by the company s recognition of tax expense of  to reflect occ s tax on its income from foreign jurisdictions during furthermore  occ  which files a separate return  recognized no tax benefit from its operating losses due to uncertainties regarding its ability to realize a portion of the benefits associated with future deductible temporary differences deferred tax assets and net operating loss carry forwards  prior to their expiration

in addition  revenues increased at ans due to revenues earned for services provided under the nbc agreement for the msnbc partial digital upgrade 
entertainment revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the avalanche 
the avalanche  acquired in july  reflected no revenues in the first half of as compared to million for the first six months of the increased avalanche revenues were partially offset by lower revenues at the nuggets  primarily attributable to the absence of million in nba expansion fees recognized in  and at beacon  since beacon had no movie releases in as compared to one in cost of services cost of services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  costs of services for multimedia distribution was million  or of multimedia distribution revenue for the year ended december  compared to million  or of multimedia distribution revenue for the year ended december  the decline in multimedia distribution margin is primarily attributable to one time charges of million at occ for costs associated with the integration of spectravision  the alignment of occ s operating practices and the establishment of occ as a new public company

depreciation and amortization for entertainment was million  or of entertainment revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of entertainment revenues  for the year ended december  this increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of the avalanche 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include only those costs incurred by the parent company  ascent entertainment group  inc  decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this decrease primarily reflects the reduction of approximately million in certain general and administrative service charges from comsat offset by an increase in costs associated with being a publicly traded corporation in other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  an increase of million from the year ended december  which reflected million in other expense

interest expense and extraordinary loss interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to borrowings incurred in conjunction with ascent s initial public offering in december to pay off indebtedness owed to comsat and the additional borrowings incurred during to fund the company s continuing expansion of its businesses  primarily for capital expenditures at occ and the assumption of debt in connection with the acquisition

in addition  million of cash was invested by beacon on films under production and development and to acquire rights for film properties and million in cash was used by the sports teams to make payments associated with long term player contracts 
the company s working capital position improved by million  from a working capital deficit of million at december  to positive working capital of million at december  this improvement is primarily attributable to the refinancing of both the ascent and occ credit facilities and the issuance of the notes see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  whereby short term debt of million at december  was refinanced on a long term basis 
the working capital improvement is also attributable to an increase in cash of million  the classification of million of film inventory as a current asset and a reduction in deferred revenue of million  primarily at beacon  due to the recognition of certain previously deferred revenues upon delivery of films to their respective distributors 
total indebtedness of the company at december  consists primarily of the notes totaling million and million outstanding under occ s credit facility 
based on borrowings at december   the company had access to million of long term financing under the ascent credit facility and occ had access to million of long term financing under the occ credit facility  subject to certain covenant restrictions see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is proposing to offer approximately to million of arena notes during the second quarter of for purposes of financing the development and construction of the pepsi center 
the arena notes are expected to be secured by some or all of the assets of the arena company  including the pepsi center and by the revenues of the pepsi center  including certain corporate sponsorships 
the company s cash requirements during are expected to include i the continuing conversion and installation by occ of on demand in room video entertainment systems  ii construction of the pepsi center  iii funding the development  production and or acquisition of rights for motion pictures at beacon  iv funding the operating requirements of ascent and its subsidiaries  and v the payment of interest under the ascent credit facility and occ credit facility 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in connection with the continuing installation and conversion by occ of on demand in room video entertainment systems may be approximately to million in the company anticipates that occ s funding for its operating requirements and capital expenditures for the continuing installation by occ of on demand in room video entertainment systems will be funded primarily through cash flows from occ s operating activities and financed under the occ credit facility 
the expenditures for construction of the pepsi center will be funded through the anticipated proceeds of the arena notes 
however  as a result of the timing of the closing of the arena notes  the company has  and will continue to advance during the first half of  funds to the arena company to support the ongoing construction activity 
beacon s cash requirements with respect to the funding of its anticipated movie productions are expected to consist of expenditures totaling approximately to million during such cash requirements will be dependent upon the number  nature and timing of the projects that the company determines to pursue during to fund beacon s productions  the company expects to utilize beacon s domestic distribution agreement with universal pictures when appropriate  and or pre sell a portion of the international distribution rights to help fund motion picture costs 
the company s other long term capital requirements may include ans participation in an upgrade of the nbc affiliate network 
ans cash requirements  should it be awarded the nbc agreement  may consist of expenditures of to million  commencing in late or  substantially all of which are currently anticipated to be financed through operating leases 
management of the company believes that available cash  cash flows from operating activities and funds available under the ascent credit facility and occ credit facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  together with the anticipated proceeds from the arena notes will be sufficient for the company and its subsidiaries to satisfy their growth and finance working capital requirements during however  it is the company s expectation that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to cover planned capital expenditures during and and  accordingly  no cash interest is payable on the notes until june thereafter  the company s ability to pay interest on the notes and to satisfy its other debt obligations will depend upon the future performance of the company and  in particular  on the successful implementation of the company s strategy  including conversion of the hotel rooms acquired in the spectravision acquisition to occ s on demand technology  the upgrade and expansion of occ s technology and service offerings and construction of the pepsi center in denver  and the ability to attain significant and sustained growth in the company s cash flow 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement its strategy or that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet its long term debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
based on the company s current expectation with respect to its existing businesses  the company does not expect to have cash flows after capital expenditures sufficient to repay all of the senior secured discount notes at maturity and  accordingly  may have to refinance the notes at or before their maturity 
there can be no assurance that any such financing could be obtained on terms that are acceptable to the company  or at all 
in the absence of such financing  the company could be forced to sell assets 
as previously discussed  on june   comsat completed the distribution of the ascent common stock held by comsat as a tax free dividend to comsat s shareholders 
the distribution was intended  among other things  to afford ascent more flexibility in obtaining debt financing to meet its growing needs 
the distribution agreement between ascent and comsat see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements terminated an agreement between ascent and comsat which imposed restrictions on ascent to ensure compliance with certain capital structure and debt financing restrictions imposed on comsat by the federal communications commission 
as a result  ascent s financial leverage has increased and may increase in the future for numerous reasons  including the sale of the arena notes 
in addition  pursuant to the distribution agreement  certain restrictions have been put in place to protect the tax free status of the distribution 
among the restrictions  ascent will not be allowed to issue  sell  purchase or otherwise acquire stock or instruments which afford a person the right to acquire the stock of ascent until july finally  as a result of the distribution  ascent is no longer part of comsat s consolidated tax group and accordingly  ascent may be unable to recognize tax benefits and will not receive cash payments from comsat resulting from ascent s anticipated operating losses during and thereafter 
also  in connection with the acquisition  ascent and occ entered into an agreement the occ corporate agreement  pursuant to which occ agreed  among other things  not to incur any indebtedness  other than under the occ credit facility and refinancings thereof and indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which together shall not exceed million in the aggregate  without ascent s prior written consent 
in connection with occ s budget process  ascent consented to occ incurring up to million through december  provided that such indebtedness be incurred in compliance with the financial covenants of occ s credit facility 
inflation inflation has not significantly impacted the company s financial position or operations 
information systems and the year as is the case for most other companies using computers in their operations  the company and its subsidiaries are in the process of addressing the year problem 
the company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its information  technology  and manufacturing computer software to programs that will consistently and properly recognize the year many of the company s systems include new hardware and packaged software recently purchased from vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from vendors that timely updates will be made available to make all remaining purchased software year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test all of its software for year compliance  and the company expects to complete the project by late the financial impact of making the required systems changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
