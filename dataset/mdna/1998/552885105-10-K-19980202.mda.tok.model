results of operations compared to net income for was million  or per share  which included gains of million which was partially offset by an extraordinary item of million incurred in connection with a loan refinancing prepayment fee 
net income for of million  or per share  included net gains of million  which resulted from the sale of three industrial buildings as well as the sale of a partnership interest 
income before net gains increased from million in to million in funds from operations ffo totaled million for fiscal  compared to million in mgi calculates ffo in conformity with the nareit definition which is net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
mgi believes ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations year ended november  net income   less net gains and extraordinary item   plus building depreciation   plus tenant improvement and commission amortization   funds from operations   the million increase in income before net gains from to resulted principally from a million increase million versus million  respectively in property operating income which is defined as rental income less property operating expenses and real estate taxes  offset by increases in interest and depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in interest expense of million was due primarily to debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of properties 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  reflecting the greater number of properties owned 
additionally  general and administrative costs increased by million  primarily reflecting higher personnel costs

base rents on leases signed or renewed in are expected to generate approximately million of additional revenues in fiscal as such leases become effective 
for the comparable office properties  rents from leases executed in are  in aggregate  higher than rents previously in place 
retail operating results were relatively unchanged from nevertheless  the combination of retail leases executed in and year to date in fiscal  at the aurora  illinois property should positively impact this segment based upon scheduled expirations 
bradlees  inc  which  pursuant to chapter of the federal bankruptcy code  affirmed its lease at the peabody  massachusetts store owned by mgi  has obtained an extension to submit a reorganization plan until august the multi family properties experienced revenue growth of  which reflected higher rental rates offset by a slight decline in occupancy at two michigan apartment properties 
property operating income from the office r d and industrial properties combined did not change significantly from fiscal but should benefit in fiscal from recently executed leases 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the trust completed the sale of a  square foot industrial property located in northborough  massachusetts and realized a gain of million 
in addition  the trust has executed contracts for the sale of two florida apartment complexes  a south carolina industrial property and a nashville  tennessee retail property  although the sales are subject to the satisfactory completion of certain terms and conditions  including due diligence by the potential purchasers 
with the completion of the pending sale of the south carolina industrial property  all of the trust s office r d and industrial properties will be located in new england

subsequent to  the trust executed leases for  square feet of vacant space and for  square feet scheduled to expire in at yorkshire plaza in aurora  illinois 
regarding an office r d building located in billerica  massachusetts  mgi elected to enter into an early termination of a lease which was expiring in  and signed a new lease for  square feet 
the space was vacated early in december and  following completion of tenant improvements  the new tenant is expected to begin occupancy at the start of the second quarter of at a materially increased rental rate

the change in property operating income from to reflects improved results from comparable properties which is defined as properties owned throughout both and  as well as the effect of the sale and acquisition of properties as detailed below 
income growth from comparable properties is largely due to improved performance from the trust s comparable office properties  which generally experienced lower vacancy and slightly higher rental rates  offset in part by increased operating expenses

the increase in office property operating income relating to new england properties was primarily due to the portland square  portland  maine acquisition  which contributed million to the net change 
the increase in the retail segment was largely due to the contribution of the bradlees  inc store in peabody  massachusetts  which began paying rent in november  following the affirmation of its lease under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
the primary factor in the decline in property operating income from industrial properties located outside of new england was a decrease from an overall leased rate at november  to an overall leased rate at november  higher revenues from the non new england office buildings contributed to the increase in office property operating income 
the decrease in operating income from to in the multi family segment is largely due to the sale of the posada del rey apartments in metairie  louisiana in september the decrease in property operating income from the non new england other properties was directly related to the sale of a partnership interest in a san bruno  california apartment complex

mgi believes it will continue to be able to extend or refinance maturing mortgage loans upon satisfactory terms 
subsequent to november   the trust closed on a ten year  million fixed rate non recourse loan bearing interest at a rate of and also signed a commitment letter for a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
cash requirements in will include distributions to shareholders  capital and tenant improvements and leasing expenditures

included in the amount for capital improvements were million of costs associated with building renovations 
during  budgeted capital expenditures are anticipated to aggregate million 
tenant improvements relating to anticipated leasing activity are budgeted at million in  of which million relates to recently executed leases 
sources of funds in the future are expected to be from property operations  mortgaging or refinancing of existing mortgages on properties  borrowing under mgi s lines of credit and mgi s portfolio of investment securities 
other potential sources of funds include the proceeds of public or private offerings of additional equity or debt securities or the sale of real estate investments 
it is presently anticipated that the purchase of additional properties in will be primarily financed by debt and  to a lesser extent  by cash flow from operations  short term investments and the proceeds  if any  from the sale of real estate or of equity and debt securities 
mgi believes the combination of available cash and cash equivalents  the value of mgi s unencumbered properties and other resources are sufficient to meet its short and long term liquidity requirements 
other during the past three years  the impact of inflation on mgi s operations and investment activity has not been significant 
real estate investments and operations are subject to a number of factors  including changes in general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space  a decline in effective rents or a reduction in the demand for real estate  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance or to fund capital and tenant improvements required to maintain market position and control of operating costs 
in certain markets in which the trust owns real estate  overbuilding and local or national economic conditions have  in the past  combined to produce lower effective rents and or longer absorption periods for vacant space 
as the trust re leases space  certain effective rents may be less than those earned previously 
management believes its modest diversification by region and property type and its diverse tenant base somewhat reduce the risks associated with these factors and enhances opportunities for cash flow growth and capital gains potential  although there can be no assurance thereof
