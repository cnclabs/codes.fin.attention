village inn s comparable sales increase was due primarily to increased average customer expenditures from menu mix changes coupled with a modest customer count increase

consolidated restaurant operating profit increased in versus bakers square accounted for the majority of the improvement as a result of programs to control waste and gain efficiencies 
also  more pronounced costs of programs to improve customer counts in  reduced advertising costs  and the closure of unprofitable locations contributed to the improvement 
village inn s restaurant operating profit improved due largely to reduced food and advertising costs

in  the company recorded a  asset disposal charge related to its decision to close almost all of its angel s diner restaurants after determining that its strategy of using that concept to invigorate underperforming restaurants was not economically viable 
the charge reduced the carrying values of related assets to net realizable value and provided for closure and carrying costs 
in  the company recorded a  charge related primarily to a plan to close and dispose of underperforming restaurants and discontinue a portion of the company s manufacturing and distribution activities 
also  included was the recognition of the impairment of the carrying values on four properties and an accrual for administrative restructuring costs 
as of october   all of the restaurants scheduled for disposition had been closed 
operating results for the closed restaurants for the past three fiscal years were as follows bakers square sales    restaurant operating profit loss    village inn sales    restaurant operating profit loss    angel s sales    restaurant operating profit loss    total sales    restaurant operating profit loss    in  the company discontinued internal warehousing and distribution of grocery products for its restaurants 
the company has not experienced significant changes in delivered product costs as a result of the change 
also  the company closed its bakery facility in phoenix  arizona  in and its bakery facilities in denver  colorado  and orlando  florida  in the effective income tax rates used for financial reporting were in  in  and in the higher rates in and were largely due to the greater impact of tax credits  primarily the fica tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of funds is cash provided by operations 
cash flow from operations increased in due primarily to higher operating income 
the company s working capital is generally in a deficit position because  like most restaurant businesses  substantially all sales are for cash  while credit is received from trade suppliers 
furthermore  the company has not maintained large excess cash balances  but rather has utilized available cash for capital spending  repayment of borrowings or the repurchase of its common stock 
the company supplements cash provided by operations with bank borrowings and occasional lease financing 
during fiscal  the company reduced its outstanding debt borrowings by million 
at october   the company had million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  with million available for additional direct advances 
on december   the company accepted an amended and restated credit agreement which provides for both an increase in the available credit and an extension of the maturity of the existing agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement  additional direct advances of million would have been available at october  at october   the company had properties which it was trying to dispose of 
five of these properties were owned in fee and the rest were leased 
the company intends to sell the fee properties over the next year and approximately million to million of proceeds are expected to be realized from their sale 
the company does not anticipate significant proceeds from the disposition of the leased properties 
it is expected that the majority of the leased properties will be disposed of through sublease over the next seven months 
cash carrying costs of approximately million are expected to be incurred over that period 
the company expects to sublease eight of the properties at rentals lower than the company s obligations under the prime leases 
those sublease losses will be funded over the remaining years of the leases and the company does not anticipate any material affect on the company s liquidity 
in   shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for  under authorizations approved by the board of directors 
at october  and  authorization to repurchase an additional  common shares was available 
future purchases with respect to this authorization may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
capital expenditures in totaled million and consisted of million for improvements to existing restaurants  million for the purchase of equipment previously leased  and million for other support related projects 
capital expenditures of million are expected for five to seven new restaurants are planned during cash flow from operations  funds available under a bank credit facility  or other financing sources are expected to be adequate for planned capital projects and any repurchases of common stock authorized by the board 
at october   the company had  of net deferred tax assets  the majority of which relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling  the company has established a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that the full amount of the operating loss carryforwards will be applied against future taxable income 
while a continuation of the company s taxable income level is not sufficient to realize the portion of the net deferred tax asset related to the operating loss carryforwards before the expiration periods  the company feels that its operating results are not indicative of future performance 
historically  the company had taxable income in excess of the amount necessary for realization and believes it will do so again in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
cumulative taxable income of approximately  for fiscal years and will be necessary to realize net deferred tax assets of approximately  before the net operating loss carryforwards expire 
the company also believes certain tax planning strategies may be employed to increase taxable income at least sufficient to realize remaining net deferred tax assets 
vicorp has guaranteed certain leases for restaurant properties sold to others in and restaurant leases of certain franchisees 
minimum future rental payments remaining under these leases were approximately million and million as of october  and  respectively 
these guarantees are included in the definition of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of accounting loss  however  the company has not been required to make payments with respect to these guarantees and presently has no reason to believe any payments will be required in the future 
the company believes it is impracticable to estimate the fair value of these financial guarantees eg  amounts the company could pay to remove the guarantees because the company has no present intention or need to attempt settlement of any of the guarantees 
over the next two years  the company anticipates replacing its existing systems at a cost of million to million 
the new systems will be year compliant 
management outlook the minimum wage in california is scheduled to increase to per hour in march  and a number of other states have indicated that they are considering raising their minimum wage rate above the federal level 
in order to partially offset this labor cost inflation  some menu price increases are contemplated at this time 
the mid scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely competitive 
improvements in future operating performance will be primarily dependent upon the company s ability to increase comparable sales  especially given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at existing restaurants 
cost controls will also play a significant factor in future profit growth 
in addition  numerous external factors could have a significant impact on future performance  including  but not limited to  food costs  labor availability  site availability  the economy  the weather and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  mandated benefits and taxes 
historically  the company has mitigated the effects of inflation through cost controls and periodic price increases 
management believes it will be able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures  although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints and other business considerations
