item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction us foodservice s business strategy is to increase net sales through internal growth of chain and street sales  while acquiring other foodservice distributors to expand the company s distribution capabilities and increase penetration of its existing markets 
with the acquisition of rykoff sexton  inc on december  the acquisition  us foodservice formerly jp foodservice  inc became the second largest broadline foodservice distributor in the united states based on net sales 
the acquisition expanded the company s distribution capabilities nationwide and strengthened its competitive position in several major markets 
a renewed focus on the growth of chain and street sales at the former rykoff sexton distribution centers  combined with additional sales by companies acquired in the fiscal years ended june  fiscal and june  fiscal  resulted in net sales growth of in fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the corresponding prior periods 
the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to june prior to april   rykoff sexton had a fiscal year that ended on the saturday closest to april the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  accordingly  the company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june  fiscal have been restated to include the results of operations for rykoff sexton 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended june  and june  combine the results of jp foodservice for such periods with the results of rykoff sexton for the years ended june  and april   respectively 
fiscal  and each consist of week periods 
in connection with the acquisition  the company incurred restructuring costs  asset impairment charges  transaction costs and certain other operating charges resulting from the integration of the two businesses the acquisition related costs  which significantly affected the company s results for fiscal the acquisition related costs totaled approximately million  of which million consisted of non cash charges 
excluding the impact of the acquisition related costs  the company s net income before extraordinary item was million or per share on a diluted basis  representing a improvement over combined results of the company for fiscal computed on the same basis 
the following includes a discussion of the results of jp foodservice and rykoff sexton prior to the acquisition 
since each company was separately managed prior to the acquisition  certain operating results are discussed on a combined basis  but in the context of the individual companies 
references to jp foodservice below generally relate to activities of the company prior to the acquisition 
other fiscal acquisitions 
the company has pursued an active program of strategic acquisitions to take advantage of growth opportunities from ongoing consolidation in the fragmented foodservice distribution industry 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired outwest meat company outwest  located in las vegas  nevada 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired westlund provisions  inc westlund  a foodservice distributor specializing in custom cut meats located in minneapolis  minnesota 
these two acquisitions complemented the company s existing operations in those markets  while enabling the company to enhance significantly its custom cut meat offerings 
also in the third quarter of fiscal  the company expanded the scope of its distribution network into the northeastern united states by acquiring sorrento food service  inc sorrento  a broadline distributor located in buffalo  new york 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  their operating results are included from the date of the respective acquisitions 
fiscal acquisitions 
prior to the acquisition  jp foodservice extended the scope of its distribution network into the western region of the united states through its acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal of valley industries  inc valley  a broadline distributor located in las vegas  nevada 
also in the first quarter of fiscal  pursuant to jp foodservice s strategy to increase penetration of its existing service areas  jp foodservice acquired arrow paper and supply co  inc arrow  a broadline distributor located in connecticut serving the new england  new york  new jersey and pennsylvania markets 
in the second quarter of fiscal  jp foodservice filled a gap in its midwestern distribution network by acquiring squeri food service  inc squeri  a broadline distributor located in ohio serving the greater cincinnati  dayton  columbus  indianapolis  louisville and lexington markets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  jp foodservice strengthened its presence in the mid atlantic region through its acquisition of mazo lerch company mazo lerch  a broadline distributor located in virginia serving the district of columbia  virginia  maryland  southern new jersey and northern north carolina markets 
the valley and squeri acquisitions were accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting  and accordingly  the operating results for all years presented have been restated to incorporate the results of valley and squeri 
the arrow and mazo lerch acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the operating results of arrow and mazo lerch are included only from the date of the respective acquisitions 
fiscal acquisitions 
in may  rykoff sexton significantly expanded the geographic coverage of its distribution network in the southeastern  southwestern and mid atlantic regions of the united states through its acquisition of us foodservice inc usf 
in addition  in november  rykoff sexton enhanced its distribution network throughout the state of nevada when it acquired substantially all of the assets of h o foods  inc h o foods  a regional  broadline institutional foodservice distributor 
both of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the operating results of usf and h o foods are included only from the date of the respective acquisitions 
results of operations the company sells a significant portion of its products at prices based on product cost plus a percentage markup 
periods of inflation in food prices result in higher product costs  which are reflected in higher sales prices and higher gross profits 
gross margins generally are lower for chain accounts than for street accounts 
however  because there are typically no commission sales costs related to chain account sales and because chain accounts usually have larger deliveries to individual locations  sales and delivery costs generally are lower for chain accounts than for street accounts 
gross margins generally are higher for private label products than for national brand products of comparable quality 
the company  however  incurs additional advertising and other marketing costs in promoting private label products 
the principal components of expenses include cost of sales  which represent the amount paid to manufacturers and food processors for products sold  and operating expenses  which include selling primarily labor related expenses  warehousing  transportation and other distribution costs  and administrative expenses 
because distribution and administrative expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  unexpected changes in net sales  such as those resulting from adverse weather  can have a significant short term impact on operating income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal higher chain account and street sales contributed significantly to net sales growth 
acquisitions of foodservice distributors other than rykoff sexton in late fiscal and during fiscal accounted for net sales growth of 
an increase of in chain account sales reflected the continued growth in sales to the company s larger customers 
street account sales increased in fiscal primarily as a result of the growth of the sales force and continued improvements in sales force productivity 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continuing shift in product mix from certain high margin items to higher turnover  lower margin items center of the plate products in the former rykoff sexton operations  as well as decreased margins at certain of the operating units that were closed as part of the acquisition restructuring plan 
acquisition related costs of million for writedowns of inventory at operating units undergoing consolidation or realignment also caused a decline in the company s margins for fiscal the effect on gross profit of the shift in product mix was offset in part by an increase in street sales as a percentage of net sales and the growth of the company s private brand and signature brand product sales in fiscal sales of private brand and signature brand products increased by in fiscal over fiscal in addition  the company estimates that it achieved approximately million in savings from the consolidation and renegotiation of its purchasing programs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to million of acquisition related costs recognized in fiscal  which consisted principally of writedowns of receivables and other assets at operating units undergoing consolidation or realignment

the company also recognized a million curtailment gain upon the suspension of all participation and benefit accruals under one of rykoff sexton s defined benefit plans 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible amortization totaled million in both fiscal and fiscal restructuring  impairment of long lived assets and other charges 
the acquisition related costs in fiscal included a net restructuring charge of million 
these costs consist primarily of change in control payments made to former executives of rykoff sexton and severance  idle facility and facility closure costs related to the company s plan to consolidate and realign certain operating units and consolidate various overhead functions and a reversal of million of unutilized reserves from a prior restructuring 
the acquisition related costs also included asset impairment charges of million 
these charges were related to writedowns to net realizable value of assets and facilities at operating units that are being consolidated or realigned and assets related to management information systems which are being replaced and not currently utilized 
the company expects that it will recover the cash portion of the acquisition related costs over the next two years through income tax benefits and proceeds from the sale of closed facilities 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of the acquisition related costs 
operating margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal excluding the impact of the acquisition related costs  income from operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted in an operating margin of in fiscal compared to an operating margin of in fiscal the increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to reduced operating expenses and the synergies achieved in integrating the rykoff sexton operations 
interest expense and other financing costs  net 
interest expense and other financing costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the refinancing of certain indebtedness of jp foodservice and rykoff sexton  as described below  in connection with the acquisition 
the company s new credit facility reduced average borrowing costs by approximately basis points during the second half of fiscal from the level in fiscal the interest rate reduction was offset in part by higher average borrowings  which were primarily attributable to the nonrecurring charges associated with the acquisition 
nonrecurring charges 
acquisition related costs included nonrecurring charges of million principally related to fees for financial advisory  legal  accounting and other professional services incurred by both companies to consummate the acquisition 
during fiscal  the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million with respect to legal and other professional fees required to complete the acquisitions of valley and squeri 
income taxes

as a result of this refinancing during fiscal  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million net of million income tax benefit related to the write off of deferred financing costs with respect to the extinguished debt and additional payments to holders of the company s senior notes due  which were paid in full in accordance with their terms 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following comparison of fiscal operating results to fiscal operating results is materially affected by the acquisitions of usf and h o foods consummated by rykoff sexton in fiscal because of the significance of the usf acquisition and the related change in rykoff sexton s fiscal year end from april for years and before to june for subsequent years  there are no directly comparable financial statements 
the operating results of rykoff sexton for fiscal therefore have been compared to the operating results for the week period ended april  results for fiscal do not include any periods for usf and include the six month period from november  to april  for h o foods

rykoff sexton s gross profit margin in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the acquisition of usf  as well as the inclusion of a full year of operating results for h o foods  were primarily responsible for the reduction 
both usf and h o foods operate as broadline distributors which typically have lower gross margins than the historical rykoff sexton divisions 
the gross profit margin also was affected by the transition of the historical rykoff sexton divisions from niche distributors to broadline distributors that provide customers with an expanded selection of product categories  including fresh meats  produce and seafood  typically carrying lower margins 
the synergies achieved through the effective integration of the acquisitions and improved pricing of food and non food related products from enhanced purchasing programs resulted in an improvement in gross profit of approximately million 
this improvement was offset in part by million in nonrecurring inventory and promotion related charges incurred in the integration of usf 
jp foodservice s gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of jp foodservice s private and signature brand products  which increased to of street sales at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal jp foodservice also realized purchasing synergies through the consolidation of its purchasing programs with those of the acquired entities

the improvement also was attributable to the transition to broadline distribution discussed above  which generally produces lower operating expense levels 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by approximately million in nonrecurring charges incurred in connection with the integration plan for rykoff sexton and usf 
operating expenses for fiscal included net gains of million related to sales of certain assets and the reversal of million of insurance reserves 
operating expenses for fiscal were negatively affected by the relocation of rykoff sexton s los angeles division to a new distribution center and higher than expected bad debt and insurance expense 
jp foodservice s operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted from distribution cost savings related to a higher percentage of sales to chain accounts  increased penetration of street accounts  savings resulting from revised management compensation agreements relating to certain of the acquired businesses  and the absence of costs corresponding to those associated with the severe winter weather conditions experienced in a majority of jp foodservice s markets in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets

cash flows from operating activities 
net cash flows provided by used in operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected the company s adoption in january  as required  of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 pursuant to which the company accounted for the million received from the securitization of jp foodservice accounts receivable as a sale of those receivables 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company had accounted for this transaction as a financing 
in addition  in fiscal  the company experienced a million increase in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of net sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase was offset in part by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses  including restructuring charges which have not been expended

the company s net working capital balance at june  was million 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company used million in net cash flows in fiscal for investing activities  which included million of capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures were used primarily for construction of new distribution centers in fort mill  south carolina and las vegas  nevada  expansion of distribution centers at various locations  and upgrading of management information systems 
the company currently expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  including approximately million to upgrade and expand its existing facilities 
net cash flows used for investing activities in fiscal also included million of costs related to the acquisitions of outwest  sorrento  and westlund and million in proceeds from sales of idle facilities and other properties 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal included million from the issuance of common stock and million used to purchase common stock in connection with a stock repurchase program announced by jp foodservice in the second quarter of fiscal as of june   the company s long term indebtedness  including current portion  totaled million 
on december   in connection with the consummation of the acquisition  the company entered into a new credit facility which provides for a million five year revolving credit facility and a million revolver term loan facility which is renewable annually 
initial borrowings under the new credit facility were used to repay the former jp foodservice revolving line of credit loans and senior notes due and the former rykoff sexton revolving and term loan facilities 
the total debt repaid was approximately million 
amounts borrowed under the new credit facility bear interest at the option of the company at a rate equal to the sum of a the london interbank offered rate libor  a specified prime rate plus  or the federal funds rate plus  and b an applicable margin

from time to time  the company acquires other foodservice businesses 
any such business may be acquired for cash  common stock of the company  or a combination of cash and common stock 
accordingly  management may determine that it is necessary or desirable to obtain financing for acquisitions through additional bank borrowings or the issuance of new debt or equity securities 
the company believes that the combination of cash flow generated by its operations  additional capital leasing activity  sales of duplicate assets  and borrowings under the new credit facility will be sufficient to enable it to finance its growth and meet its currently projected capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
information systems and the impact of the year issue the year issue results from a programming convention in which computer programs use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
software and hardware may recognize a date using as the year  rather than the year such an inability of computer programs to recognize a year that begins with could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s program 
the company has undertaken a program to address the year issue with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems including its billing  accounting and financial reporting systems  ii the company s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment  telephone systems and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded microcontroller technology  iii certain systems of the company s major vendors and material service providers insofar as such systems relate to the company s business activities with such parties  and iv the company s material customers insofar as the year issue relates to the company s ability to provide services to such customers 
as described below  the company s year program involves i an assessment of the year problems that may affect the company  ii the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase  iii the testing of such remedies and iv the preparation of contingency plans to deal with worst case scenarios 
assessment phase 
in order to determine the extent to which its internal systems are vulnerable to the year issue  the company is currently evaluating the systems that are date sensitive 
the company s distribution centers and corporate headquarters currently use various information systems to process transactions and meet financial reporting needs 
most of these systems are not fully year compliant 
as of june   information systems used by seven of the distribution centers are year compliant 
the company s data processing systems represent its most significant challenge with respect to year compliance 
the company expects that its evaluation of its internal systems will be completed by december  in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company will complete sending letters to certain of its significant hardware  software and other equipment vendors and other material service providers  as well as to its significant customers  requesting them to provide the company with detailed  written information concerning existing or anticipated year compliance by their systems insofar as the systems relate to such parties business activities with the company 
the company expects that it will complete its distribution of these inquiries by december  remediation and testing phase 
the activities conducted during the remediation and testing phase are intended to address potential year problems in company developed computer software and in its other information technology and non information technology systems in an attempt to demonstrate that this software will be made substantially year compliant on a timely basis 
in this phase  the company will first evaluate a program application and  if a potential year problem is identified  will take steps to attempt to remediate the problem and individually test the application to confirm that the remediating changes are effective and have not adversely affected the functionality of that application 
the company will undertake similar remediation and testing with respect to the hardware and other equipment that runs or is run by the software 
after the individual applications and system components have undergone remediation and testing phases  the company will conduct integrated testing for the purpose of demonstrating functional integrated systems operation 
following completion of its internal  integrated systems testing  the company intends to conduct laboratory simulated integrated systems testing in an attempt to demonstrate substantial year compliance of the company s systems as they interface with external systems and equipment of major vendors  other material service providers and material customers 
during fiscal  among other activities  the company replaced information processing systems consisting of hardware and software at five distribution centers  initiated software remediation efforts at locations  and installed new payroll and human resources information systems at locations 
as of the date of this report  the company has initiated software and hardware remediation efforts at the remaining distribution centers and its corporate headquarters 
the company currently seeks to have most of its software remediated by december and to have all of its information systems at its distribution centers and its corporate headquarters year compliant by july contingency plans 
the company intends to develop contingency plans to handle its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios  which it has not yet identified fully 
the company intends to complete its determination of worst case scenarios after it has received and analyzed responses to substantially all of the inquiries it has made of third parties 
following its analysis  the company intends to develop a timetable for completing its contingency plans 
costs related to the year issue 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million in costs for its year program 
it has also made approximately million of capital expenditures on new information processing systems that are already year compliant 
the company currently estimates that it will incur additional costs  which are not expected to exceed approximately million  to complete its year compliance work with respect to the company s major information systems 
of such additional costs  approximately million are expected to be incurred during fiscal and approximately million are expected to be incurred during fiscal these costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company currently believes that the costs to resolve compliance issues with respect to other information systems and its non information technology systems will not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that the foregoing cost estimate will not change as the company completes its assessment 
risks related to the year issue 
although the company s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the company s business and operations  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts described above cannot be known until the year failure by the company and its major vendors  other material service providers and material customers to address adequately their respective year issues in a timely manner insofar as such issues relate to the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
