liquidity and capital resources the company s utilization of licensees in its national branded novelty business allows it to operate with relatively low capital requirements 
the company s licensing strategy reduces working capital requirements to that necessary to support advertising  sales promotion and administrative activities rather than the much larger amounts that would be required to support the self manufacture of finished consumer goods 
working capital requirements generally precede the seasonal pattern of the company s sales 
the company believes that the cash generated from operations and funds available under its credit agreements provide the company with sufficient funds and the financial flexibility to support its ongoing business  planned capital expenditures of million in  strategic objectives and debt repayment requirements 
the company s principal customers are approximately licensee dairies  each having specific geographic territories 
as a result of its national territorial licensing system  the top four and ten customers  respectively  account for approximately and of the company s net sales

the loss of one or more of these major licensees could cause some disruption in the company s operations  although  based upon prior experience with replacing major licensees  management believes it could locate a suitable replacement within a short period of time and  as a result  such customer loss would not have a significant impact on the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources

impact of year the company is currently in the process of implementing a new management information system that will  along with other benefits which extend well beyond year issues  address the company s internal year issues 
the implementation project should be completed by december  at a cost which is not expected to exceed million 
the cost of the project is being capitalized and will be amortized to expense over the expected useful life 
costs solely attributable to the year issue  which are not anticipated to have a significant impact on the company s results from operations or liquidity  will be expensed as incurred 
the company is also in the process of evaluating the readiness of its major suppliers  customers and other business partners to year issues 
at the current time  the company can not predict the outcome of this evaluation of its external business partners  although based on prior experience  management believes it could locate suitable replacements if any partners were lost as a result of year issues and  as such  any loss should not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company expects to complete the external evaluation by december
