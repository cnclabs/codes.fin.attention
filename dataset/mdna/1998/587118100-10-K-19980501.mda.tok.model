the company had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  the company s working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup is financed with both short term and long term borrowings in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
in  as inventories were reduced by sales in december and january  working capital was also reduced as the net proceeds from these sales were used to reduce outstanding long term borrowings under the then existing credit agreement 
in and cash generated by december and january sales resulted in larger cash balances as no amount has been outstanding under credit agreements with banks after the sale of the notes in march net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million   and in   and  respectively 
these amounts primarily represent net earnings plus depreciation and amortization and increases in current liabilities  offset by increases in inventories and other current assets 
the increase in inventories of million in  million in and million in resulted from the addition of inventory for new and acquired stores and stores expected to be opened shortly after the year end  backstocking and the purchase of fabric used in the direct sourcing of inventory 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively

the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment  for store remodeling and expansion and for warehouse expansion 
the company anticipates that each of the approximately new traditional stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately  subject to the same seasonal patterns affecting inventory at all stores  which will be funded by the company s revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry and recent financial difficulties of significant menswear retailers may present the company with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than the company s past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
the company has recently received  and from time to time in the past has received  inquiries concerning its interest in possible acquisitions and has requested information with respect thereto 
the company may use cash on hand  together with its cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and issues of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities

in connection with the company s direct sourcing program  the company may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
the majority of the forward exchange contracts are with one financial institution 
therefore  the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by this party 
however  due to the creditworthiness of this major financial institution  full performance is anticipated 
the company may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions being hedged
