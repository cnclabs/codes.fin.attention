costs and expenses expenses related to gas and oil production  production taxes  and depreciation  depletion and amortization have increased in each of the last two years due to increased production and revenue levels resulting from successful drilling operations as well as the knpc and presidio acquisitions 
on an mcfe basis  the company s costs have increased during the past year as a result of the presidio acquisition 
costs of gas and oil production rose to

the company reduced its net deferred tax asset to million in deferred tax assets related primarily to the company s net operating loss and investment tax credit carryforwards were initially recorded in with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  but had been reserved entirely by a valuation allowance until based on additions to the company s gas and oil reserves and the resulting increases in anticipated future income  the company now expects to realize the future benefit of its net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
a valuation allowance of approximately million at december  has been provided against the company s net deferred tax assets based on management s estimate of the recoverability of future tax benefits 
the valuation allowance relates primarily to the inability to use certain net operating loss and investment tax credit carryforwards 
the company evaluated all appropriate factors to determine the proper valuation allowance for these carryforwards  including any limitations concerning their use  the year the carryforwards expires and the levels of taxable income necessary for utilization 
in this regard  full valuation allowances were provided for investment tax credit carryforwards and option plan compensation 
based on its recent operating results and its expected levels of future earnings  the company believes it will  more likely than not  generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit attributable to the net operating loss carryforward for which valuation allowances were not provided

the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors

during  wildhorse invested approximately million for gas gathering and processing assets 
the company percent and kne percent jointly own wildhorse 
wildhorse is operated by kne under the direction of an operating team with equal representation from kne and the company 
the company has dedicated significant amounts of its rocky mountain gas production to wildhorse for gathering  processing and marketing 
kne contributed gas marketing contracts and storage assets in western colorado 
the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as no amounts of the company s future gas and oil production have been sold at contractually specified prices 
during  the average prices received for gas and oil by the company were per mcf and per barrel  respectively  as compared to mcf and per barrel in and per mcf and per barrel in year the company utilizes software and technologies throughout its operations that will be effected by the date change in the year year issue 
an assessment of the systems that will be affected by the year issue is underway 
the company does not believe the costs related to the year issue will materially impact its results of operations 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  on which the company s systems rely  will be timely converted or that a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows
