excluding acquisitions net of the negative impact of the stronger us dollar  enclosure products and systems sales in grew 
in  sales grew due to the effect of acquisitions  continued demand for its products  the expansion of its direct sales force and geographic expansion in europe and asia 
sales for the engineered solutions segment improved compared to the increase was the result of the acquisition of versa tek in october  which contributed  along with growth primarily in european truck and automotive markets 
the strengthening us dollar negatively impacted sales by in sales increased in over  primarily the result of increased sales in the thermal management market 
sales in the tools and supplies segment increased in to from in the increase was primarily the result of of increased sales from acquisitions offset by declining asian sales and the effect of the strengthening us dollar 
the impact of the stronger us dollar negatively impacted reported sales by approximately for the year

the impact of the stronger us dollar in over negatively impacted sales by approximately 
sales percentage change from prior year geographic sales north america europe japan and asia pacific latin america totals  the company does business in many different geographic regions and is subject to various economic conditions 
the improved economic environment in north america and the effect of acquisitions combined to increase sales in this region over sales increased in over primarily due to the improving us economy and the acquisitions made in the third quarter of and the first quarter of sales in europe grew in compared to the combination of the vero acquisition  which contributed  along with strong internal growth accounted for the growth 
sales grew in compared to  primarily the result of two acquisitions 
sales in japan and asia pacific fell in due to the general economic down turn in this region 
in  sales decreased in japan and asia pacific  of which was attributable to foreign currency fluctuations 
the remaining decrease was caused by weakening economic conditions 
the sales growth generated in latin america during and was the result of geographic expansion in this region 
as the company s recent acquisition strategy has focused on north america and europe  sales from japan  asia pacific and latin america are expected to become a smaller percentage of the company s total sales in gross profit gross profit increased in to compared to in and in the increases in gross profit resulted primarily from increased sales in and gross profit percentages by segment enclosure products and systems engineered solutions tools and supplies totals the one time charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal negatively impacted gross profit by these charges primarily relate to a decision to discontinue certain product lines and skus  principally within tools and supplies 
to a lesser extent  charges were incurred to conform zero inventory valuation methods to the company s 
excluding the impact of these charges  the gross profit percentages by segment would have been gross profit percentages by segment excluding one time charges enclosure products and systems engineered solutions tools and supplies totals the following discussion addresses the gross profit percentages by segment excluding the effect of the one time charges discussed above 
the overall gross profit percentage for the company is primarily influenced by the relative sales mix between enclosure products and systems  engineered solutions and tools and supplies 
engineered solutions gross profit percentages are lower than either enclosure products and systems or tools and supplies because a much higher proportion of its sales are made to oem customers  which typically generate lower margins than non oem customers 
the gross profit percentage in engineered solutions increased in versus as a result of efforts to reduce costs associated with manufacturing 
tools and supplies gross profit percentage remained relatively flat in compared to  however  the decline in compared to was primarily due to of non recurring charges recorded in and competitive pricing pressures 
since  gross profit percentages in enclosure products and systems have been declining 
this is the result of the effect of the enclosure related acquisitions that took place during and these enclosures are sold primarily to oem customers and carry a lower gross profit margin 
with the recent acquisition of rubicon and the company s continued focus on oem customers  the gross profit percentage within enclosure products and systems is expected to moderately decline in the future 
however  as discussed below  these enclosure businesses operate with lower selling  administrative and engineering expenses 
the overall gross profit margin of the company will vary depending on the levels of oem sales within engineered solutions and enclosure products and systems 
operating expenses operating expenses increased in  of which the fourth quarter one time charges represented these one time charges related to costs associated with the zero merger  goodwill impairment on two apw business units  and restructuring and downsizing efforts in all three business segments 
to a lesser extent  charges were incurred to conform zero s accounting policies with the company s 
excluding the one time charges  operating expenses increased and in and  respectively 
during the corresponding periods  sales increased and  respectively 
the majority of the increase since relates to variable selling expenses and increased amortization of goodwill associated with recent acquisitions 
in addition to variable selling expenses  total operating costs have increased as a result of acquisitions  product development programs and expenditures for geographic expansion into emerging markets 
approximately of the increase in fiscal was attributable to businesses acquired since overall  the lower corporate expenses as a percent of sales are attributed to the effects of the lower operating cost enclosure businesses and the company s goal to continually identify ways to be more cost efficient and have allowed the company to reduce operating costs as a percent of sales 
excluding restructuring and other one time items  operating costs as a percent of sales were   and in  and  respectively 
other expense income other expense income net financing costs other net the trend of increased net financing costs over the last three years is the result of increased debt levels following the company s acquisitions during this period 
for further information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
other net includes foreign exchange gains and losses as well as miscellaneous other income and expenses 
the company recognized gains on the sale of two properties in totaling and life insurance proceeds of offsetting these gains was a write down recorded to reduce a european subsidiary to its estimated realizable value 
additionally  in and  the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies and the company realized foreign exchange gains due to transactions denominated in currencies outside of the functional currencies of certain of its foreign units 
income tax expense the company s effective income tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the rate for is largely impacted by the current non deductibility of the one time charges recorded in the fourth quarter 
excluding the one time items  the effective income tax rate was 
the non deductibility of goodwill on many of the company s acquisitions over the last three years has led to the gradual increase in the company s effective tax rate 
with the rubicon acquisition subsequent to year end  this trend is expected to continue in new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

year considerations as is the case for most companies  the year computer issue creates a risk for the company 
if systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
however  the impact cannot be quantified at this time 
the company is taking actions intended to ensure that its computer systems are capable of processing periods for the year and beyond 
the company has developed and has clearly articulated a written policy that year readiness is an important responsibility for all its business leaders 
in addition  the company is aggressively pursuing a comprehensive set of programs intended to reduce the risk of disruptions due to the year problem 
issues addressed in the context of these efforts include  but are not limited to  creating management awareness regarding the year problem and the need to become year ready  mitigating known year readiness problems  communicating the company s year readiness commitment to its customers  conducting a company wide year readiness check  the official designation of year readiness contacts within each business unit  comprehensive testing and compliance certification for all of the company s mission critical business and manufacturing control systems  proactive year compliance certification of key suppliers  and the development of contingency plans to deal with emergent year situations 
the company expects to complete the majority of its efforts in this area by the end of its fiscal this should leave adequate time to perform additional testing and make any further modifications that are deemed necessary 
the company is continuing an ongoing process of assessing potential year risks and uncertainties 
however  it is currently premature to define the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios related to the year problem 
the company s year readiness initiatives are intended to address its critical business functions  and the company currently expects to successfully mitigate its controllable internal year issues 
however  the company also relies upon third parties whose failure to identify and remediate their year problems could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s year readiness efforts will include attempting to identify  assess and mitigate third party risks where possible  but the potential impact and related costs and consequences of third party failures have not yet been identified 
based on the current status of the company s compliance and readiness efforts  the costs associated with identified year issues are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
most of the company s business units have installed or are in the process of installing new business management systems which go beyond just year compliance 
the costs of purchased software are capitalized 
some businesses have chosen to upgrade existing systems to be compliant 
these costs are being expensed as incurred 
additionally  the company is developing a contingency plan to deal with any issues that are not resolved on a timely basis 
the company historically has not quantified the costs of year compliance and remediation  but believes costs incurred to date were immaterial 
the company estimates remaining costs to range between and  which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations 
at this time  the company does not expect the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the year problem to have material adverse effects on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
however  the company cannot be certain that it will not suffer business interruptions  either due to its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible to fulfill their commitments to the company 
furthermore  the year problem has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be reasonably foreseeable  and there can be no assurances that every material year problem will be identified and addressed or that unforeseen consequences will not arise and possibly have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated factors while implementing the changes necessary to mitigate year problems  including  but not limited to  the ability to locate and correct all relevant codes in computer and imbedded systems  or the failure of critical third parties to communicate and mitigate their year problems could result in unanticipated adverse impacts on the business activities or operations of the company 
european economic monetary union on january   eleven of the european union countries including eight countries where apw operations are located are scheduled to adopt the euro as their single currency  and there will be fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
the euro will then trade on currency exchanges and be available for noncash transactions 
following the introduction of the euro  the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries during the transition period from january  through january  beginning on january   the european central bank will issue euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy bills and coins and use the euro as their legal currency 
the company s various operating units located in europe which are affected by the euro conversion intend to keep their books in their respective legacy currency through a portion of the three year introductory period 
at this time  the company does not expect the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the euro conversion to have material adverse effects on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
inflation no meaningful measures of inflation are available because the company has a significant number of small operations which operate in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
outlook the company expects its trend of increasing sales and earnings per share to continue into fiscal  assuming no significant downturn in the economy in north america or western europe 
net sales are expected to be approximately  with increased sales at all three of the company s business segments 
the strength of its core markets and the incremental effect of recent acquisitions will be the driving forces of the growth 
operating profit is expected to improve as a result of the increased sales and the streamlining and cost reduction efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of the improved operating profit is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective income tax rate  generating record earnings per share 
risk factors that may affect future results certain statements in this form k  including the above section entitled outlook  as well as statements in other company communications  which are not historical facts  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the terms anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  objective  plan  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements

subsequent events on september   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  apw enclosure systems limited  accepted for payment all shares of rubicon group plc rubicon common stock which had been tendered pursuant to the apw enclosure systems limited tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock at pounds sterling per share and all outstanding shares of cumulative preferred stock at pounds sterling per share  which constituted control  and continued with steps to acquire the remaining outstanding shares 
rubicon is a leading provider of electronic manufacturing services and engineered magnetic solutions to major oems in the information technology and telecommunication industries 
consideration for the transaction totaled approximately  including related fees and expenses 
apw enclosure systems limited obtained all of the funds it expended from the company 
to provide the necessary funds  the company and enerpac bv  a netherlands subsidiary of the company  as borrowers  entered into a multicurrency credit agreement  dated as of october   providing for an  year revolving credit facility the new facility 
in conjunction with the closing of the new facility  the company terminated its prior  year revolving credit facility the facility  and used certain funds received under the new facility to repay borrowings under the facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note a summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note i long term debt 
currency risk the company has significant international operations 
in most instances  the company s products are produced at manufacturing facilities located near the customer 
as a result  significant volumes of finished goods are manufactured in countries for sale into those markets 
for goods purchased from other company affiliates  the company denominates the transaction in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company has adopted the following guidelines to manage its foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through the use of naturally offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  netting  pooling  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company s identifiable foreign exchange exposures result primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers along with the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company identifies naturally occurring offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
the company s financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk the company enters into interest rate swaps to stabilize financing costs by minimizing the effect of potential interest rate increases on floating rate debt in a rising interest rate environment 
under these agreements  the company contracts with a counter party to exchange the difference between a fixed rate and a floating rate applied to the notional amount of the swap 
the company s existing swap contracts range between two and seven years in duration 
the differential to be paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized in net income as an adjustment to interest expense 
credit and market risk is minimized through diversification among counter parties with high credit ratings 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for steel 
therefore  the company has established a program for centralized negotiation of steel prices 
this program allows the company to take advantage of economies of scale as well as to cap pricing 
all business units are able to purchase steel under this arrangement 
in general  the contracts lock steel pricing for months and enable the company to pay less if market prices fall
