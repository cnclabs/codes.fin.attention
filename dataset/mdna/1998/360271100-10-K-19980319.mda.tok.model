results of operations overview the corporation s net income for was a record million or per share basic 
this compares to net income of million or per share basic and net income of million or per share basic 
over the past three years  the corporation has generated steady earnings growth through its focus on core banking business  strategic acquisitions and controlling expenses 
net income as reported for was higher than  while net income was higher than reported net income includes certain unusual income and expense items which distort the earnings growth rate over the past three years 
the following table adjusts net income for significant unusual items 
the adjustments shown reflect the after tax impact on income dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income as reported    investment securities gains 
   saif charge  adjusted income    increase over prior year adjusted income per share basic increase over prior year diluted increase over prior year the saif charge in represents the corporation s share of the industry wide fdic assessment to recapitalize the underfunded savings association insurance fund saif 
the table also adjusts for investment security gains to remove the impact of varying levels of gains 
however  as discussed in the other income section  the corporation does have a history of recurring income from investment security gains 
the table illustrates the steady core earnings growth that the corporation has realized over the past three years 
the corporation also continued to achieve strong returns on average assets roa and average shareholders equity roe over the period 
roa was in compared to in and in roe increased in to from in and in net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of net income 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate environments is critical to the success of a banking entity 
as with overall net income  the corporation has demonstrated consistent growth in net interest income over the past three years 
in addition  the corporation was able to maintain a stable net interest margin fully taxable equivalent over the period in both and and in the corporation s net interest margin has historically placed it in the top third of its self defined peer group 
during  net interest income increased to million compared to increases of and during and  respectively 
the comparative average balance sheets and net interest income analysis on page and the rate volume table on page summarize the components of net interest income and illustrate increases as a result of changes in interest rates versus growth in assets and liabilities 
in general  the increases in net interest income in both and were a result of balance sheet growth 
interest income increased million or from million in to million in this increase reflects the growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million or during  after increasing million or during and million or during the majority of this growth in interest earning assets was in loans 
average loans increased million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in recent years  consumer and commercial lending have driven this growth 
average annual yields on interest earning assets over the past three years have remained fairly stable in  in and in and have had little impact on overall interest income 
in march  the federal reserve board raised short term interest rates by basis points 
as a result  the corporation s affiliate banks raised their prime lending rates from to and the average prime rate increased to in from in this prime rate increase contributed to the basis point increase in the corporation s overall yield in the yield on the corporation s loans  however  actually declined by basis points to 
this decrease was due to a increased competition caused more aggressive pricing of certain new loans  and b the mix of the corporation s loan portfolio to a larger percentage of consumer loans and fixed rate loans reduced the percentage of floating rate loans which are affected by short term rate fluctuations 
offsetting the decrease in the loan yield was an increase in yields on investments  primarily taxable investment securities 
this was a result of the corporation shifting its investment focus from us treasury and agency issues to mortgage backed securities 
in general  funds from maturing investments were reinvested in mortgage backed securities to achieve a higher return with only moderate increases in credit risk 
as a result  yields on the portfolio steadily improved 
interest expense increased million or in  reflecting the growth in interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities increased million or during  after increasing million or during and million or during average interest bearing deposits provided much of this growth  increasing million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as with interest earning assets  changes in the cost of interest bearing liabilities had a lesser impact on interest expense than changes in volume 
the average annual cost of funds was in  in and in the cost of funds  however  did rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets in as a result of the growth of the corporation s time deposits as a percentage of total deposits 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for totaled million  compared to the and provisions of million and million  respectively 
the million increase in the provision in was a result of loan growth and a higher rate of net charge offs experienced during the year 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were in  in and in the increase in charge offs in was due to certain large accounts at newly acquired affiliate banks as well as an increase in charge offs on the corporation s consumer loan portfolio 
despite this increase  however  the corporation s low charge off levels continued to rank it among the best in its peer group 
nonperforming assets including accruing loans greater than days past due as of december  were million 
this was a million or increase over the december  total of million 
this increase was due to the growth in the loan portfolio during nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to at the end of as compared to at the end of at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans net of unearned income stood at  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of total nonperforming loans  the allowance was  and at december   and  respectively 
the detail of non performing assets as of december  and net charge offs by loan type for and follows nonperforming assets net charge offs in thousands real estate loans   commercial industrial loans    consumer loans     other real estate owned   total     nonperforming assets include all loans days or more past due as to principal or interest  nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
the majority of the nonperforming real estate loans were residential real estate loans which  in the opinion of management  are adequately secured 
management considers various factors in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining the provision for the period 
among these are the mix and risk characteristics of loan types in the portfolio  charge off history  risk classification of significant credits  adequacy of collateral  the amount of the allowance that is not specifically allocated to individual loans  and the balance of the allowance relative to total and nonperforming loans 
in management s opinion  based on its consideration of these factors  the allowance for loan losses of million at december  is adequate 
other income noninterest income was million for this represents an increase of million or over the total of million  which  in turn  was higher than the total of million 
excluding the impact of higher security gains in  other income increased million or 
almost all noninterest income categories increased during  mainly as a result of the corporation s growth 
investment management and trust services income reached a record level of million in  an increase of million or  following a increase of  or 
the growth during and was due to increased marketing of traditional trust services as well as the continued success of several new investment management products 
the customized cash reserve investment management product continued to grow as an important vehicle for companies  municipalities  and not for profit institutions looking to enhance the short term return on their invested funds 
likewise  private banking  which integrates personalized investment portfolio management with traditional commercial bank deposit and loan services  continued to attract new clients 
in  the corporation also introduced investment brokerage services 
an expanded  full service k program was introduced toward the end of which contributed to trust revenue growth during service charges on deposit accounts increased million or during  after increasing million or in the increase in was due to changes in fee structures on some of the corporation s deposit products and services  as well as growth in fee based deposits 
the increase was generated by the introduction of foreign atm charges 
the corporation uses a product review and development process through which all products and services provided by the corporation s subsidiary banks are reviewed on a rotating basis 
this review allows the corporation to formally assess product features and pricing in comparison to its competitors 
other service charges and fees increased  or during after increasing  or in the increases in both and were a result of growth 
investment security gains increased million or to million in the majority of the gains realized during  million  were generated from the sale of equity securities 
management monitors the corporation s available for sale securities and makes periodic sale and investment decisions based on current and expected market conditions 
during the past three years  certain investments were sold as a result of management s assessment of market conditions 
the increase in was due to the strong performance of the equity markets  which made realizing certain gains appropriate 
other expenses noninterest expenses for increased million or to million  from the total of million  after increasing million or during excluding the pre tax impact of the one time saif assessment of million recorded in  other expenses increased million or in and million or in the corporation s efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to fully taxable equivalent revenues excluding investment securities gains  improved from in excluding the impact of the saif assessment to in this improvement illustrates the corporation s success in controlling expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expense  which accounts for the largest portion of other expenses  increased million or during as compared to an increase of million or in the salary portion of the increase in was million or  which exceeded the corporation s average merit increase budget of 
the increase in excess of budget was due to an increase in the total number of employees 
the average number of full time equivalent employees in rose to  from  in  resulting in an increase in cost of approximately  the salaries component of the increase was million or 
this lower increase rate is reflected in a stable employee base  with average full time equivalent employees of  in both and the corporation manages its staffing levels to function at the highest level of efficiency while maintaining quality customer service 
employee benefits increased million or in and  or in the increase was due to establishing a  accrual for certain post employment benefits 
excluding this accrual  benefits increased only 
despite the overall cost increases  the corporation has seen improvement in salaries and benefits expense measures 
the salaries and benefits efficiency ratio improved from in to in and salaries and benefits to average assets improved from in to in net occupancy expense increased  or during  compared to an increase of  or in equipment expense increased  or in  after increasing  or in the increases in occupancy and equipment expenses reflect the growth in the corporation s branch network and investment in necessary technology initiatives 
the increase in equipment expense in was due  in part  to the roll out of fulton bank s check imaging product  which became available to customers in the latter part of investments in technology have been carefully balanced with the corporation s commitment to its branch network  which continues to be the customers preferred delivery channel in the corporation s markets 
the corporation will continue to face the challenge of developing and offering modern conveniences to customers while maintaining its community and branch banking focus 
expenses incurred to address the year computer problem have been  and are expected to be  immaterial to the corporation 
the significant loans and deposits data processing functions of the corporation are outsourced to an independent third party  which is in the process of ensuring that the corporation s systems will be year compliant 
the costs associated with this process will be absorbed by the service provider 
the corporation  however  does recognize the business risks posed by the year and has been working closely with the third party to address its specific needs 
the corporation would incur expenses to replace  modify or upgrade other computer hardware and software that it employs in the normal course of its business 
such equipment and software includes items processing readers sorters  branch terminals and networks  other personal computers and networks  security systems  and certain other processing systems 
based on its review of this equipment and software  the corporation has determined that the costs to be incurred will be immaterial 
fdic assessment expense decreased million or in after decreasing  or in the decrease in was due to the one time saif assessment of million recorded in the  expense for was based on an assessment rate of on the corporation s approximately million of saif insured deposits and for bank insurance fund bif deposits  which represent all other deposits 
these rates will be in effect for the next two years 
fdic expense will increase in the future as the corporation s deposits grow 
from january  through september   the rate on the corporation s bif insured deposits was reduced to zero  with a requirement for a minimum premium of  per institution 
the savings from this rate reduction  which approximated million in  were offset by the one time assessment on saif insured deposits 
on september   legislation was enacted to adequately fund the saif  which remained undercapitalized as a result of the savings and loan crisis in the late s 
the legislation called for a one time assessment on saif insured deposits 
as a result of this special one time assessment  the saif became fully funded  and the new insurance rates noted above were implemented 
special services expense  which represents the cost of data processing  increased  or during after increasing million or in the corporation has generally been able to control this cost by maintaining common systems for all subsidiaries under a corporate contract 
the and increases are due to growth in trust operations and loans  resulting in larger transaction volumes and costs 
other expenses decreased  or during after increasing million or during expenses in this category include stationery and supplies  postage  audits  telecommunications  pennsylvania shares tax  advertising  insurance  legal fees and goodwill amortization 
the decrease in was due mainly to fewer operating risk losses decrease of  or and a decrease in the cost of the corporate owned life insurance plan due to a change in the underlying contracts decrease in expense of  or 
these decreases were offset by increases in state taxes  or  telephone expense  or increase  and advertising  or increase 
income taxes income tax expense continued to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of pretax income 
the effective tax rate was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduction in the beneficial effect of tax exempt income as the corporation s investments in tax free securities continued to decline 
the corporation continued to invest in low and moderate income housing partnerships which generate federal income tax credits 
net credits earned from these investments totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively

the table on page highlights the trends in the balance sheet over the past two years 
because annual averages tend to conceal trends and ending balances can be distorted by one day fluctuations  the december monthly averages for each of the last three years are provided to give a better indication of trends in the balance sheet 
all references within the discussion that follows are to these december average balances unless specifically noted otherwise 
the corporation s assets continued to grow during  reaching billion  an increase of million or as compared to the increase was due to strong loan demand throughout the corporation s markets that resulted in loan growth of approximately million or for the year 
this loan growth was funded primarily through an increase in deposits 
loans loans outstanding net of unearned income increased million or for  compared to a increase of million or 
commercial loans and commercial mortgages increased million or in  reflecting the strength of the local economy 
the increase in was evident primarily in fixed rate categories  as customers locked in the relatively low rates in effect throughout the period 
fixed rate commercial mortgages increased million or and fixed rate commercial loans increased million or 
demand for consumer credit also provided a significant share of loan growth during  with such loans increasing million or 
this increase was largely due to the corporation continuing to expand its indirect lending operations 
this expansion  coupled with strong demand for automobiles  resulted in an installment loan increase of approximately million or 
also contributing to the increase in consumer loans were student loans increase of million or  and leasing increase of million or the corporation engages in the origination and sale of conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans primarily to the federal national mortgage association fnma 
in general  fixed rate mortgages are underwritten to salable criteria and are sold to fnma through forward sales commitments to limit risk 
the corporation generally retains servicing rights for such loans and receives a standard servicing fee of basis points on the outstanding principal 
in and  the corporation originated approximately million and million  respectively  of such loans for sale into the secondary market 
at december   the corporation had servicing rights on approximately million of sold mortgage loans 
as a result of its secondary market activity  residential mortgage loans outstanding increased only million or in the majority of this increase was in adjustable rate mortgages 
investment securities investment securities increased million or during  compared to a decrease of million or during in general  the increase resulted from strong deposit growth  while maturing investments were used to fund loan growth during in  the corporation continued two shifts in its investment strategy 
one of these was the classification of almost all new purchases as available for sale rather than held to maturity to increase flexibility in managing the corporation s funding needs see further discussion below 
the second was in investing in mortgage backed securities mbs rather than us treasury securities 
at december   mbs investments had an amortized cost of million  a million or increase over conversely  u 
s 
treasuries decreased million or to million 
investments in mbs have become more attractive to the corporation due to their higher yields  with little increase in relative risk 
the corporation s investment in equity securities was million amortized cost basis at december   of which approximately million represented holdings of stock issued by the federal home loan bank fhlb 
as of december   all subsidiary banks were members of the fhlb and therefore eligible for its funding programs 
the corporation continued to follow an equity securities investment strategy of seeking and maintaining long term investment positions in regional financial institutions which  in management s view  represent solid investment value 
at december  the corporation s equity portfolio had unrealized gains of million  which increased the overall investment balance  but used no additional funds 
investments in tax exempt municipal securities decreased to million at december  from million in this continued decrease reflects the effect of the tax reform act of  which sharply reduced the tax benefit of the majority of tax exempt securities acquired subsequent to its passage and thus reduced the corporation s incentive to invest in them 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that all investment securities be classified as either i held to maturity  ii available for sale  or iii a trading security 
the corporation possesses both the intent  subject to credit impairment  and ability to hold debt security in its investment portfolio to maturity 
management does  however  recognize the portfolio to be an important potential source of liquidity 
therefore at december   million or amortized cost basis of all debt securities were classified as available for sale 
this compares to million or classified as available for sale at december  at december   securities available for sale had an estimated fair value of million and an amortized cost of million  compared to an estimated fair value of million and an amortized cost of million at december  the increase in the aggregate unrealized appreciation is primarily a result of the favorable performance of the corporation s equity portfolio  offset by the gains realized during at december   securities held to maturity had an estimated fair value of million   above their amortized cost  compared to an estimated fair value of million  or  below their amortized cost at december  short term investments  which include federal funds sold  money market investments and interest bearing deposits with other banks  have decreased over the past several years in order to fund loan growth 
short term investments decreased million during after decreasing million during other assets noninterest earning assets increased million or in after increasing million or in the increases in both years were due mainly to new expenditures for premises and equipment capital expenditures on premises and equipment totaled million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
capital expenditures were made for branches and improvements  as well as investments in technology to strengthen the corporation s competitive position in its markets 
during  the corporation continued its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments totaling million were made to six new projects 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects  all located in the various communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of such investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low and moderate income individuals in its service area in support of its subsidiary bank s community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some instances  state programs 
deposits the corporation has historically been able to rely on deposit growth as a relatively low cost funding source for loans 
in recent years  increased competition from other financial services providers has made attracting deposits more difficult 
in  deposit growth was strong  with a million or increase  which was sufficient to support the loan growth of million 
in  however  deposits increased only million or  as compared to loan growth of million 
the corporation used higher cost borrowings as an alternative funding source 
management believes that its community banking focus and merger strategy will result in lower cost deposits continuing to be its primary funding source over the long term 
however  the occasional use of borrowings for additional funds may be necessary at times 
the use of borrowings in recent years has not had a detrimental impact on the corporation s net interest margin in and and in  and management believes that there will be no material adverse impact on the net interest margin in the near future 
despite the overall increase in deposits in  there was a shift in the composition 
core deposits  including non interest bearing deposits and interest bearing now  checking and savings accounts increased million or 
time deposits certificates and ira s increased million or 
as a result  core deposits accounted for of total deposits at december  as compared to a year ago 
total interest bearing deposits grew million or in compared to growth of million or in a large portion of this increase was realized in short term certificates of deposit  those with initial maturities of less than two years  which increased million or in the corporation has been much more successful attracting deposits with shorter terms  indicating a preference by customers to maintain liquidity in their accounts 
noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts increased during and  growing million or and million or  respectively 
in the future  the corporation must continue to focus on retaining time deposits and generating additional core deposit relationships 
borrowings short term borrowings  consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  and treasury  tax and loan notes  decreased million or in after increasing million or in as noted above  the decrease in was a result of strong deposit growth while the increase in was necessary to fund new loans 
long term debt increased million or during after increasing million or during during and  the corporation took advantage of certain fhlb funding programs 
fhlb advances represent the majority of the long term debt balances 
shareholders equity shareholders equity continued to be an important funding source  with a balance of million  an increase of million or from million in in spite of increasing dividends  the corporation maintained a strong rate of internal capital generation net income less dividends paid divided by beginning equity 
this internal capital growth was in and growth in capital is dependent upon strong earnings and a prudent dividend policy  represented by payout ratios of for and for in march   the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of the corporation s common stock through march  the stock to be repurchased is to be used for various purposes  including the corporation s incentive stock option plan  employee stock purchase plan and profit sharing plan 
during  a total of  shares were repurchased under this plan at a total cost of million 
all of these shares were held in treasury at december  the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 
the corporation s total and tier i risk based capital ratios have generally placed the corporation near the middle of its self defined peer group over the past year 
the corporation s ratio of tier capital to average assets  however  has generally placed it in the top quartile in comparison to its peers 
market risk the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions cost basis of approximately million and us government and agency stock cost basis of approximately million 
the corporation s equity investments had a total estimated fair value of million at december  the million unrealized gain is attributable to the financial institutions stock 
although the book value of equity investments accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of periodically realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
the corporation manages its equity market price risk by investing only in regional financial institutions 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided here since none of them have maturity dates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first of all  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
secondly  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net income 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
this committee s primary responsibility is to address the liquidity and net income risks noted above 
the goals of the corporation s asset liability management function are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between the relative rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled million or of total assets 
this represents an increase from the december  total of million or of total assets 
liquidity is also provided by non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due from one to five years  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
principal payments received on the held to maturity mortgage backed securities portfolio also provide liquidity 
the corporation had million of such mortgage backed securities at december  and million at december  the loan portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity due to the corporation s ability to participate in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market of million and million in and  respectively  provided the necessary funding which allowed the corporation to meet the needs of its customers for new mortgage financing 
from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on the steady growth of this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank  which provides them access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected contractual cash flows from financial instruments 
expected contractual maturities  however  do not necessarily estimate the net income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from contractual cash flows 
in order to manage the risk that changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on net income  the corporation  through its alco function  relies on certain analytical tools  including static gap analyses and net interest income forecasting 
as required by banking regulators  the corporation also employs certain interest sensitivity  income volatility and market value of equity analyses 
static gap illustrates the expected repricing periods for all rate sensitive assets and liabilities and shows the difference or gap for each period 
despite the fact that static gap only addresses rate risk at a point in time and is not as sophisticated as certain modeling and forecasting methods  it remains a popular tool in the industry and for the corporation 
interest rate sensitivity varies widely with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at the short end of the asset spectrum are overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans  whose rates float with the prime rate or a similar index 
at the other end are long term investment securities and fixed rate loans 
on the liability side  jumbo time deposits and short term borrowings are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings and fhlb advances 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap the difference between repricing opportunities for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities must be managed over all time periods  the corporation focuses on the month period as the key interval affecting net interest income 
this shorter period is monitored because a large percentage of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to repricing within this period 
in addition  short term interest rate swings can be more pronounced and provide a shorter time for reaction or strategy adjustment 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  daily adjustable days days days gap cumulative gap the corporation s policy provides for the month cumulative gap to be maintained between 
and 
the corporation was positioned within this range throughout and as of december  in addition to static gap analysis  the corporation also performs periodic net interest income forecasts using a rate shock approach 
rate shocks measure the impact of severe interest rate changes on a static balance sheet over a one year period 
the corporation s policy  as approved by the board of directors  is for the corporation and each individual affiliate to experience no more than a decline in net interest income and market value of equity for every basis point change in interest rates 
this policy is reviewed and updated on an annual basis 
the rate shocks employ various assumptions about the magnitude of rate changes on individual rate sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  the beginning point for these shocks is a historical or static balance sheet position 
variations from the static position could result in significant variance from the models 
the assumptions used are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis
