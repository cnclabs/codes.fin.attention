the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the sales of its products  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in the company s existing research  licensing and other relationships and terms of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that the company may establish 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
limited commercialization  uncertainties of product development and market acceptance 
the company currently markets three products  the simon nitinol filter  which is marketed worldwide  a line of the company s peripheral vascular stents under the name symphony  which is marketed by boston scientific in europe and the united states  and the cardioseal septal occluder 
the company s stents and cardioseal septal occluder may require substantial further investment in research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and governmental regulatory approvals prior to being marketed and sold in the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products  or any other products developed by the company will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by the company s devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
many alternative treatments currently are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
there can be no assurance that the company s devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that physicians or the medical community in general will accept and utilize the company s devices or any other medical products that may be developed by the company 
dependence upon collaborators 
the company has entered into distribution agreements with bard radiology and bard international granting them exclusive distribution rights to the company s snf  and a license agreement with boston scientific granting boston scientific exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and distribute the company s stent technology and products which incorporate such technology 
although bard radiology and bard international have agreed not to sell competing filters  boston scientific is not prohibited from selling other stents and  in fact  manufactures and licenses from others a variety of stents that may compete with the company s stents 
boston scientific may choose to emphasize such other stents in its developmental and marketing efforts 
there can be no assurance that these arrangements will be renewed or that the company s existing relationships with bard radiology  bard international or boston scientific will continue in their current form 
the company s business could be materially adversely affected if its arrangements with bard radiology  bard international or boston scientific prove unsuccessful or if such companies terminate their arrangements with the company  negotiate lower prices  sell additional competing products  whether manufactured by themselves or others  or otherwise alter the nature of their relationships with the company 
intense competition  rapid technological change 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
other companies in the medical device industry are currently marketing products that compete with the company s devices and may be developing  or could in the future develop  additional products that are competitive with the company s 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than the company 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that use the company s products 
limited manufacturing history  dependence on third party manufacturers 
the company currently uses third parties to manufacture components of the snf system and to distribute the snf 
final assembly of the vena cava filter system and manufacturing of the cardioseal are done by the company in its own facility 
pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with boston scientific  boston scientific manufactures and distributes the company s stents 
the company intends to continue to use third parties to manufacture and distribute such products and certain other products which the company may seek to develop 
if the company should encounter delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers in producing  packaging or distributing its proposed products  market introduction and subsequent sales of such products would be adversely affected and the company may have to seek alternative sources of supply 
no assurance can be made that the company will be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  it may not be able to commercialize medical products as planned 
the company s manufacturing facility is subject to good manufacturing practice gmp regulations  iso and other regulatory requirements  is subject to risks regarding delays or difficulties encountered in manufacturing any such medical products and may require a substantial additional investment of capital 
limited marketing and sales experience 
although the company has limited internal marketing and sales resources and personnel  and currently relies primarily on third parties to market and sell its products  the company plans to market the cardioseal septal occluder directly  if and when it receives the required regulatory approvals 
in order to market the cardioseal septal occluder and any other products that it may develop  the company will have to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
no assurance can be given that any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged or others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to the company or its licensors 
in addition  whether or not patents are issued to the company or its licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by the company 
the company could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  the company may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms if at all 
government regulation  product approvals uncertain 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products manufactured or distributed by the company are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for its products on a timely basis or at all  and delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  such approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  limitations on intended use imposed as a condition of such approvals or clearances  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertain availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  suppliers of health care products and services are greatly affected by medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as by private insurance reimbursement programs 
third party payers may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement provided for by such payers to the physicians and clinics using the company s devices  or any other products that the company may develop  or by taking the position that such reimbursement is not available at all 
if  for any reason  the company s products were not to be reimbursed by third party payers  the company s ability to sell its products may be materially adversely affected 
mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies to the implemented in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers  and governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  the company s ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
uncertainties of successful redesign of the septal repair device 
between and bard sponsored trials of an earlier version of the septal repair device  known as the clamshell 
in  bard discovered fractures of the stainless steel framework in certain of the devices implanted during such clinical trials and  following such discovery  suspended its clinical trials worldwide except for patients at high risk for surgery 
it was determined that the fractures were caused by metal fatigue resulting from higher than anticipated forces acting on the clamshell 
redesign efforts were initiated  resulting in the design of the current version of the septal repair device 
although the cardioseal septal occluder has undergone in vitro testing  there can be no assurance that such testing accurately simulates the actual forces in the human body or that similar fractures will not occur with the cardioseal septal occluder 
if such fractures occur with adverse clinical consequences  the company s efforts to commercialize the cardioseal septal occluder may be significantly delayed and the company may be required to invest significant resources in further designing and engineering the device or to discontinue its development efforts 
product liability risks  insurance 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials entail an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against the company or its third party distributors in the event that the use of the company s devices is alleged to have adverse effects on a patient 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of the company s devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although the company currently maintains limited product liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
uncertain future capital requirements 
the company may require additional funds for its research and product development programs  preclinical and clinical testing  operating expenses  regulatory processes and manufacturing and marketing programs 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the sales of its products  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in the company s existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that the company may establish 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be available on acceptable or affordable terms 
insufficient funds may prevent the company from implementing its business strategy or may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its research and product development programs or to license to third parties rights to commercialize products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
dependence on qualified personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the medical device field  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to the company s anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise such as marketing 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company s business
