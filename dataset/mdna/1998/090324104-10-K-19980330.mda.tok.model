the possible spin off would separate the company s wholesale drug business from the wholesale drug and alternate care alternate site business of priority 
the contemplated spin off would be subject to compliance with applicable securities and governmental regulations and other business considerations

in  the amount of net earnings associated with the minority interest was  the company s operations consumed million in cash for the year ended december  the use of funds resulted from increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
these uses were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increase of accounts receivable resulted from the significant increase in both brokerage and from stock sales 
the increase in accounts payable was attributed to the timing of payment terms and the build up of inventories at the end of the year 
the increase in merchandise inventory is due to the procurement of inventory for the increased customer base and the company s decision to build inventories to reduce the possibility of shortages due to potential reduction in shipments by certain vendors during the fourth quarter 
management continues to control inventory levels to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities 
capital expenditures  predominantly for the purchase of warehouse facilities  the expansion and automation of existing warehouses and the investment in additional management information systems and systems to support customer needs were million during effective july   the company purchased substantially all of the operating assets and assumed most of the liabilities and contractual obligations of twd

debenture holders could elect to convert their debentures into shares of common stock of the company through september   which was the redemption date 
holders of all but  principal amount of the  outstanding debentures elected to convert their debentures into common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each  principal amount of debentures 
the redemption reduced the company s long term debt by  and increased by million the number of issued shares of the company s common stock 
at december   the company held a note receivable with a principal balance of million from the ceo of the company 
the proceeds of this note  which bears interest at per annum  matures on december  were used by the ceo to exercise stock options 
the note provides for annual interest only payments with outstanding interest and principal to be repaid at maturity 
net increase in borrowings under the bank credit agreement was million during at december   the company had borrowed million under the bank credit agreement and had a remaining availability of million 
the company believes that its cash on hand  cash equivalents  bank line of credit and working capital management efforts are sufficient to meet future working capital requirements 
as of december   the company s short term bank line of credit was million 
the company s principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
the company sells inventory to its chain drug warehouse and other customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of its chain warehouse or other major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although the company monitors closely the creditworthiness of its major customers and  when feasible  obtains security interests in the inventory sold  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur some collection loss on chain drug or other major customer accounts receivable in the future 
year the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify and address all code changes  testing  and implementation procedures necessary to make its systems year compliant 
the company believes that with the exception of the wholesale purchasing and accounting programs of the je goold division  which is based in portland  maine  all systems will be fully compliant by the end of fiscal the je goold division is scheduled to be converted to the company s system during the first quarter of although the company will consider the status of a company s computer systems in evaluating any future acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurance that acquisitions made or contemplated by the company will be year compliant by the date of purchase 
there can also be no assurance that the systems of other companies with which it transacts business will be updated or converted in a timely manner  or that such failure will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company estimates that it will incur approximately  during fiscal and  during fiscal for the cost of this project 
inflation 
the company s financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of its ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  the company believes that its gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products it distributes 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as they are received by the company and therefore reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity
