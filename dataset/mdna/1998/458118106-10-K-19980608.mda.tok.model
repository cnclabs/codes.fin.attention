overview fiscal can be characterized as a year of continuing transition for idt 
during fiscal  revenue increased to million  compared to million during the immediately prior fiscal year 
revenue increased across all idt product lines  reflecting greater total unit shipments at a lower overall average selling price per unit 
idt recorded net income of million in fiscal  compared to a net loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
improved profitability in fiscal reflects higher revenue  the absence of a charge for asset impairment recorded in fiscal  and idt s relatively fixed base of manufacturing expenses  which are allocated between cost of revenues and process research and development expenditures based upon activities performed 
in fiscal  the company continued product and market diversification programs begun several years ago  while transitioning away from dependence upon the commodity semiconductor memory markets it historically served 
idt is focused on producing value added products such as its communications products  x and embedded risc microprocessors  high speed static random access memories srams and modules  and high performance logic products 
in both fiscal and  during the period of transition  idt s financial results were adversely impacted by several factors 
these included industry wide excess commodity semiconductor memory capacity  resultant inability to fully utilize capacity at the company s wafer fabrication plants and low selling prices for industry standard semiconductor products 
also in these years  in connection with product enhancements and transitions  included as operating expenses are significant research and development r d and other expenditures related to developing new process technologies  introducing enhanced products in existing markets  funding new product development  and start up costs incurred in markets traditionally not served by the company  especially x microprocessors for pc applications 
during fiscal  sales of idt winchip x microprocessors did not represent a major portion of idt s total revenue 
the size of the x marketplace represents a significant opportunity to idt  and the company plans to grow its winchip business 
the company also believes that costs associated with this product family will continue to increase in future quarters as the company continues to execute its product introduction strategy 
because the company is in the early stages of developing its x microprocessor business  it does not have significant experience in manufacturing  marketing and selling large quantities of these products 
risks associated with idt s winchip initiative and other aspects of the company s business are included in the discussion which follows 
on june   the company announced that it expects that as a result of product transitions  general economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  and other conditions described in this section  that revenues for the first quarter june of fiscal will decline approximately ten percent compared with the same period in fiscal this revenue shortfall would result in a first quarter pre tax loss from operations of approximately million 
in addition  first quarter results are expected to include a non recurring charge relating primarily to excess sram manufacturing capacity  certain technology matters  as well as other miscellaneous items 
based upon current information  the company estimates the amount of the pre tax charge will approximate to million  greater than half of which is expected to be non cash 
the company believes that some improvement in operating financial performance may occur in the second quarter 
however  because of current limited order visibility  and the seasonal weakness which typically characterizes the september quarter  the outlook for the second quarter remains uncertain 
results of operations revenues 
as noted above  total fiscal revenues increased to million from million in fiscal the company began its production ramp of winchip x microprocessors  recording sales of approximately million  primarily during the last quarter of fiscal fiscal revenues were million  reflecting higher selling prices of commodity sram components in that period  primarily because of strong demand for secondary cache in the pc market 
subsequently  throughout fiscal and fiscal  commodity sram prices fell or more below the highest prices realized for comparable products in fiscal in fiscal  total units shipped increased over fiscal quantities  which were up when compared to fiscal during these periods  the average selling price per unit realized by idt declined significantly  again primarily due to lower commodity semiconductor memory prices 
looking forward  the company believes that the proportion of its total sales which are represented by new products  including the winchip x microprocessor  will increase 
the winchip microprocessor is idt s first product of a planned x microprocessor product family 
the products shipped are compatible with similar products manufactured and sold by intel corp 
intel  advanced micro devices  inc amd and national semiconductor corp 
national semiconductor which recently acquired cyrix corp other new or enhanced products announced in fiscal include zero bus turnaround tm zbt tm memory  an advanced sram architecture that significantly improves performance of communications applications requiring frequent switches between reads and writes  switchstar tm products  which provide a memory and controller based network switching solution  and other communications memory products  risc embedded control products  and logic products 
the company is taking steps to increase the available supply of its winchip and other new products  however  there are risks  described below  that the company will not be successful in its efforts to do so  or that market demand or prices will change 
in the future  the company believes that the proportion of its total sales represented by commodity sram memory products will decrease 
with respect to commodity sram supply  demand and prices  idt is uncertain as to whether these market factors for commodity products will change  primarily because the company cannot anticipate how its competitors will react to current low market prices for sram components  or economic issues currently impacting the asian semiconductor market 
information on risks associated with the expansion of idt s product families and market prices of semiconductor products is included below in factors affecting future results  including risks associated with expansion of product families x microprocessors 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased million over fiscal to million 
gross profit in fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue gross margin  gross margin improved to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was 
in fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges of million which were specifically identified in the company s statements of operations as reducing gross profit 
additionally  the company recorded million in charges which relate to the write off of certain technology investments and other miscellaneous items  which have been classified in the company s consolidated statements of operations in accordance with the nature of the charge  including cost of revenues 
the million charge related principally to recording reserves against the carrying value of manufacturing assets  including the company s oldest wafer fabrication plant in salinas  california  and other items 
excluding the million charge for asset impairment and other reserves in fiscal  gross profit in fiscal was 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the absence of the charge for asset impairment described above recorded in fiscal higher gross profit and gross margin in fiscal reflects the benefit associated with higher sram prices in that period  which were up to higher than prices realized for comparable products in fiscal and costs associated with the eight inch wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  oregon adversely impacted gross margins for both fiscal and  as these costs were not fully absorbed by additional revenues 
in fiscal  in an effort to achieve more efficient and effective capacity utilization and increase idt s available supply of winchip microprocessors  the volumes of production and the level of expense associated with the oregon fabrication facility is expected to increase 
the anticipated increase in expense is mostly associated with the installation of new equipment 
in fiscal  and in future years  the percentage of these costs recorded as cost of revenues  versus process engineering research and development  has and may continue to change based upon production volumes and activities performed 
additionally  in fiscal  idt contracted with international business machines corp 
ibm for x microprocessor wafer manufacturing services using ibm s cmos process technology 
idt intends  during fiscal  to begin to utilize ibm s manufacturing services to increase the available volume of winchip microprocessors 
idt s oregon facility provides the company with significant additional available production capacity  but  to date  as a result of current market conditions for commodity semiconductor memory products  the company s production volumes at its wafer fabrication facilities have not increased sufficiently to take full advantage of the additional capacity 
the winchip microprocessor product family provides idt with the opportunity to improve utilization of its fabrication facilities  however  additional spending for capital equipment and set up time is required to process substantial volumes of these products 
historically  sram products have been produced at the oregon facility and the company is unable to predict whether demand for industry standard sram products or idt s share of the available market will improve 
should idt s production volumes  especially at its fabrication facilities  remain constant or decline and should the company be unable to otherwise decrease costs per unit sold  the company s gross profit could continue to be adversely impacted 
further  if prices on industry standard sram products do not improve or the company is not able to manufacture and sell other products at comparable or better margins  and if a greater percentage of the oregon facility s operating costs are allocated to cost of goods sold based on activities performed  then gross margin may not improve  or may decrease 
research and development 
r d expenses decreased in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal when compared to fiscal r d expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were in fiscal  a decrease of percentage points compared to fiscal for fiscal  r d expense was million  or of revenues 
the company s policy is not to capitalize pre operating costs associated with new manufacturing facilities  and in fiscal and  significant facility start up and staffing expenses were incurred at the new eight inch wafer fabrication facility in oregon 
the increase in r d expense in fiscal and is principally attributable to process engineering research costs of approximately million and million  respectively  incurred at the oregon wafer fabrication plant 
in fiscal  a greater proportion of manufacturing facility costs  including those related to the oregon fabrication plant  were classified as cost of goods sold  rather than process engineering r d  based on the nature of activities performed 
further  in fiscal  the level of spending on process r d at the oregon facility was generally consistent with the level of r d spending at idt s other fabrication facilities 
in fiscal  substantially all oregon plant expenses were charged to r d expense 
idt believes that high levels of r d investment are required to support its strategy of providing products to its customers that are not readily available from its competitors 
however  there can be no assurance that additional research and development investment will result in new product offerings  that any new offerings can be manufactured at gross margins comparable to or greater than the company s current products  or that any new offerings will achieve market acceptance 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased or million in fiscal to million  compared to fiscal in fiscal  sg a decreased to million from million in fiscal however  as a percentage of revenue  sg a was essentially unchanged in fiscal from fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal the fiscal increase and decrease in absolute dollars were primarily attributable to variable selling expenses associated with the year over year revenue changes  and changes in employee profit sharing and management bonuses which vary in relation to profitability 
in addition  sg a expenses in fiscal include initial marketing costs associated with the winchip microprocessor  and sg a expenses for both fiscal and include expenses associated with initiatives to implement enterprise wide management information systems 
relative to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal and increased as a percentage of sales due primarily to lower levels of revenues earned in fiscal and when compared to revenues earned in fiscal in fiscal year  idt anticipates that it will increase sales and marketing related costs for the winchip microprocessor to develop the target marketplace that it seeks to serve 
also in fiscal  idt plans to continue its installation of enterprise wide management information systems 
therefore  the company anticipates that sg a expenses measured in absolute dollars will increase 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest expense is primarily associated with the convertible subordinated notes  due in the notes and million of secured equipment financing agreements completed september the increase in interest expense for fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to the cessation of capitalizing interest in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the construction of the fabrication plant in oregon 
additionally  interest expense for fiscal includes a full year of interest related to secured equipment financing agreements  which were not completed until the end of the second quarter of fiscal interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  decreased million to million in fiscal in fiscal  interest income and other amounted to million compared to million for fiscal also included in interest income and other  net  is the company s share of net earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
in fiscal  idt s share of net losses realized on affiliate investments increased by million over fiscal  reducing the overall net balance 
in fiscal  interest income decreased primarily as a result of the company liquidating short term investments to pay for significant capital expenditures in fiscal also included in interest income and other for fiscal is a loss in the amount of million related to the write off of an equity investment 
management anticipates that average short term investment balances will decline in fiscal  associated with payments for significant capital expenditures causing the interest income component of interest income and other  net to decrease in absolute dollars when compared to fiscal taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and of  and  respectively  differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to earnings from foreign subsidiaries  considered permanently invested  being taxed at lower average rates than the us statutory rate  changes in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and the utilization of certain tax credits 
historically  income taxes in state jurisdictions have not been significant due to available tax credits 
the company has consumed substantially all of the tax benefits associated with its malaysian subsidiary  however  idt is currently enjoying tax benefits in the philippines associated with incentives for establishing a manufacturing subsidiary there

liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which aggregated approximately million  as compared to million at march  the company generated million of cash from operations in fiscal  up from million during fiscal cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected net income adjusted for the add back of depreciation and amortization  non cash charges for asset impairment and other and changes to working capital 
increased depreciation and amortization charges in fiscal were associated with new facilities  improvements to existing facilities and new equipment 
significant changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted from the timing of collection of accounts receivable  timing of payments for accounts payable  accrued payroll and bonus  and receipt of cash for income tax refunds receivable 
during fiscal  the company s net cash used in investing activities was million with million used for capital equipment and property and plant improvements 
cash used for the purchase of short term investments  net of sales of short term investments  was million 
in addition  at march   the company had million of restricted securities pledged as collateral under a tax ownership operating lease entered into in january related to the construction of the eight inch wafer fabrication facility in oregon 
the company s total fiscal capital expenditures were approximately million 
fiscal capital additions were principally in connection with continued installation of equipment in the oregon fabrication facility plus continued capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment at the philippines assembly and test plant and other capacity improvements 
in september  the company completed secured equipment financing agreements which total approximately million for equipment purchased for the oregon fabrication facility 
the borrowing arrangements fully amortize over the month terms of the loans 
additionally  in september and december  the company completed equipment sale and lease back arrangements with several leasing companies 
equipment purchased by the company for the oregon fabrication facility with a net book value of million was sold to the leasing companies and leased back for use at the oregon facility under leases classified as operating leases 
the company s foreign subsidiaries have lines of credit for working capital financing aggregating approximately million with various banks in the respective countries in which they operate 
at march   bank guarantees in the amount of  were outstanding 
in fiscal  the company completed the sale of million of the convertible subordinated notes  netting million in proceeds 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at per share 
during fiscal  the company completed the repurchase of approximately million of the notes at a price of approximately per bond 
the company does not anticipate making additional repurchases of debt in fiscal in view of current and anticipated capacity requirements  idt anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  principally in connection with continued installation of equipment in the oregon facility  the philippines plant and other capacity improvements 
the company intends to finance such capital expenditure through a combination of use of its existing cash  investments and borrowings under various lease and equipment financing arrangements 
the company s ability to invest to satisfy its capacity requirements is in part dependent on the company s ability to generate cash from operations 
cash flow from operations depends significantly on the average selling prices of the company s products  variable cost per unit and other industry conditions which the company cannot predict 
future declines in selling prices for industry standard sram products or other products manufactured by the company  which cannot be otherwise offset  will adversely impact the company s ability to generate funds from operations 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient funds from operations or other sources to fund its capacity and r d requirements  the company s results from operations  cash flows and financial condition will be adversely impacted 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and credit facilities available to the company will be sufficient to meet its working capital  mandatory debt repayment and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
while the company is reviewing all operations with respect to cost savings opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if the company is required to seek other financing sooner  the unavailability of financing on terms satisfactory to idt could have a material adverse effect on the company 
factors affecting future results the company s results of operations and financial condition are subject to the following risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
idt s operating results have been  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors including the timing of or delays in new product and process technology announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram commodity semiconductor memory market  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of product sold  availability and costs of raw materials  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
additionally  many of the preceding factors also impact the recoverability of the cost of manufacturing and other assets  and as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
early in fiscal  markets for some of the company s srams were characterized by excess demand relative to supply and the resulting favorable pricing 
during the later part of fiscal  however  a number of companies  principally foreign  shifted manufacturing capacity to commodity srams  causing rapid adjustments to supply and consequently impacting market prices 
the resulting significant downward trend in prices in an extremely short period negatively affected sram gross margins  and adversely affected the company s operating results which historically have been dependent on sram revenues 
in fiscal  sram average selling prices and asps of other product lines continued to decline compared to fiscal  although not as dramatically as the pace at which they declined between fiscal and fiscal market conditions characterized by excess supply of srams relative to demand and resultant pricing declines have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
although some competitors have recently made adjustments to the rate at which they will implement capacity expansion programs  the company is unable to accurately estimate the amount of worldwide production capacity dedicated to industry standard commodity sram products which it produces 
a material increase in industry wide production capacity  shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with the company s products  reduced demand  or other factors could result in material declines in product pricing and could especially adversely affect that portion of the company s operating results derived from the sale of industry standard products 
the company seeks to manage costs  but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be sufficient to sustain profitability 
the company ships a substantial portion of its products in the last month of a quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur  the company s operating results for that quarter could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial percentage of the company s products  which include sram products  are incorporated into computer and computer related products  which have historically been characterized by significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for certain of the company s products is dependent upon growth in the communications market 
any slowdown in the computer and related peripherals or communications markets could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in order to achieve more full and effective use of the facilities  the company continues to install new equipment at all of its fabrication and assembly and test facilities 
additional planned production capacity and yield improvements by the company s competitors could dramatically increase the worldwide supply of products which compete with the company s products and could  if customer demand does not absorb increased product quantities  create further downward pressure on pricing 
risks associated with expansion of product families x microprocessors 
the company commenced shipments of the winchip microprocessor  idt s first member of its x microprocessor product family in the third quarter of fiscal this product represents the company s first offering to the pc microprocessor market  which is characterized as a large market dominated by intel  with a very limited number of other competitors 
idt s success in competing in this market  and therefore the financial results associated with selling products to this market  are subject  but not limited to  the following significant risks and uncertainties competition 
intel holds a dominant position in the market for pc microprocessors 
intel has held its dominant position over all other x microprocessor competitors for a substantial period of time  and has significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing strength than idt does 
currently  intel s dominant market position allows it to set and control x microprocessor standards and  therefore  dictate many aspects of the products that pc manufacturers require in this market 
in addition  idt s initial x microprocessor product is targeted at the low cost desktop and mobile product categories of the microprocessor market 
intel also offers products which are purchased by pc manufacturers in these market categories 
intel s financial strength and market dominance have enabled it to reduce prices on its microprocessor products within a short period of time following their introduction  which reduces the margins and profitability of its competitors 
further  intel s marketing resources are far greater than idt s 
therefore  intel s pricing and marketing strategies in the categories of the microprocessor market targeted by idt significantly impact idt s efforts to serve this market and  therefore  idt s results of operations 
in order for customers to purchase idt s x microprocessors  idt s products must be compatible with other components supplied to pc manufacturers such as core logic chip sets  motherboards  basic input output system bios software and others which are manufactured or produced by other companies  including intel and companies in which intel has strategic investments 
in addition  these companies are able to produce chip sets  motherboards  bios software and other components to support each new generation of intel s microprocessors only to the extent that intel makes its related proprietary technology available 
intel has announced that the new versions of its microprocessor product will be sold only in the form of a chip module that is not compatible with socket motherboards currently used with most x microprocessors 
therefore  intel may cease supporting the socket motherboard infrastructure as it transitions to its latest generation microprocessors 
because idt s processor is designed to be socket compatible  and will not work with motherboards designed for intel s new chip module  should idt and other companies serving the x microprocessor market not be successful in offering products which extend the life of the socket infrastructure  idt would be required to expend potentially significant resources to redesign its microprocessor product offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such efforts 
in addition to intel  amd and national semiconductor s cyrix subsidiary also currently offer commercial quantities of x microprocessors for sale 
from time to time  intellectual property rights disputes have arisen between companies competing in the x microprocessor markets see intellectual property risks discussion below 
manufacturing 
the pace at which idt is able to enter its target market category for x microprocessors depends  in part  on how quickly it is able to ramp production of its microprocessor products in its wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities 
before fiscal  the company had not previously manufactured x microprocessors and has processed only limited quantities of x microprocessors to date 
therefore  as production volumes of x microprocessors increase  the company may encounter unexpected production problems or delays as a result of  among other things  changes required to process technologies  product design limitations  installation of equipment  and development of programs and methodologies which test overall product quality 
if idt is unable to ramp production of its x microprocessor successfully  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
as described above  in fiscal  idt contracted with ibm for x microprocessor wafer manufacturing services using ibm s cmos process technology 
idt intends  during its fiscal  to begin to utilize ibm s manufacturing services to increase the available volume of winchip microprocessors 
the terms and conditions of the ibm manufacturing services agreement require idt to forecast in advance production quantities that it will purchase and  once production quantities are ordered  the contract limits idt s ability to change desired quantities of ibm manufactured products 
products purchased under the ibm manufacturing services agreement must meet certain agreed to acceptance criteria 
however  these acceptance criteria do not include the number of usable winchip processors per wafer nor the speed at which they will operate 
should idt not accurately forecast the demand for ibm manufactured winchip products  or should the number of good winchip processors per ibm manufactured wafer and the speed at which they operate not meet or exceed these and other characteristics of idt manufactured products  idt s results of operations will be adversely impacted 
compatibility with software and performance certifications 
for its current product offering  idt has obtained certifications from microsoft corp 
and other appropriate certifications from recognized testing organizations 
failure to obtain and maintain such certifications for future microprocessor products could substantially impair the company s ability to market and sell its future x products 
pc market 
because idt s target market for its x microprocessor product is initially limited to certain segments of the pc industry  the growth and acceptance of the product is closely tied to trends in and growth of the pc industry 
the company believes that pc manufacturers will continue their trend towards accepting and using microprocessor products manufactured by companies other than intel and that generally the market for pcs and related components will continue to grow 
however  should these industry trends and growth patterns not occur or idt not be able to produce products which meet customers needs  for whatever reason  idt s ability to sell x microprocessor products would be impaired 
rights of others 
in exchange for payments towards product development costs  idt licensed the right to make  use and sell the winchip c tm microprocessor to a third party 
further  the license with the third party limits the number of additional licenses that idt may grant 
thus  the company may face competition from the third party in the future and may be limited in its ability to license the part to others 
future products 
idt s ability to bring future x products to market depends on several primary factors including the following three first  it must be able to finance such future development 
second  to compete with intel and other competitors in the market for future generation x microprocessors  idt must be able to design and develop the microprocessors themselves  and must ensure they can be used in pc platforms  including motherboards  designed to support future intel or other microprocessors 
third  a failure  for whatever reason  of the designers and producers of motherboards  chip sets and other system components to support idt s x microprocessor offerings  including socket compatibility  would limit idt s ability to sell products to the pc market 
risks associated with planned expansion  manufacturing risks 
historically  the company has utilized subcontractors for the majority of its incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than its own malaysian and philippines assembly and test operations 
the company expects to continue utilizing subcontractors extensively to supplement its own production volume capacity 
due to production lead times  any failure by the company to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect the company s sales and operating results 
the company is increasing the production capacity of its oregon facility to manufacture idt winchip products 
this capacity expansion program in oregon faces a number of substantial risks including  but not limited to  equipment delays or shortages  power interruptions or failures  and manufacturing start up or process problems 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  and ramping production and installing new equipment at its facilities  including the facility in oregon 
further  the company s older wafer fabrication facilities are located relatively near each other in northern california 
if the company were unable to use these facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  the company s operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to obtain other production capability 
in fiscal  in response to reduced protection offered at economically justifiable rates by the company s insurance carrier  the company eliminated earthquake insurance coverage on all facilities 
the company s capacity additions have resulted in a significant increase in fixed and variable operating expenses which may not be fully offset by additional revenues for some time 
historically  the company has expensed the operating expenses associated with bringing a new fabrication facility to commercial production status as r d in the period such expenses were incurred 
however  as commercial production at a new fabrication facility commences  the operating costs are classified as cost of revenues  and the company begins to recognize depreciation expense relating to the facility 
accordingly  as the oregon fabrication facility now contributes to revenues  the company recognizes substantial operating expenses associated with the facility as cost of revenues  which has reduced gross margins 
as commercial production continues in fiscal  the company anticipates incurring substantial additional operating costs and depreciation expenses relating to this facility 
accordingly  if revenue levels do not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels  or if the company is unable to achieve gross margins from products produced at the oregon facility that are comparable to the company s current products  the company s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
dependence on new products 
new products and process technology costs associated with the oregon wafer fabrication facility will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
dependence on limited suppliers 
the company s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by the company require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to the company due to capacity constraints 
the company s results of operations would be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
idt has been significantly dependent on the design capabilities of quantum effect design  inc qed  an equity affiliate  for the design and development of derivatives of bit mips r risc based microprocessors 
currently there are no development contracts in effect between qed and idt  and the company is now designing and developing derivatives of mips risc based microprocessors in house 
as with all new products  there is significant risk that the company will not do so successfully 
see business products and markets and research and development 
capital needs 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
in fiscal  the company expects to expend approximately million in capital expenditures  and anticipates significant continuing capital expenditures  especially in connection with the introduction of products for the winchip microprocessor family  in the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs or that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is required and if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations could be materially adversely affected 
intellectual property risks 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company in the past has been involved in patent litigation  which adversely affected its operating results 
although the company has obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  the company does not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers who have a broad portfolio of patents 
the company has been notified that it may be infringing on patents issued to certain semiconductor manufacturers and other parties and is currently involved in several license negotiations 
there can be no assurance that additional claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted in the future 
the intellectual property claims that have been made or that may be asserted against the company could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to incur significant litigation costs and damages and to develop non infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses  or significant increases in amounts payable under the current or future contracts  or the inability to obtain a license  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks of international operations 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues are derived from non us sales 
in addition  the company s offshore assembly and test operations incur payroll  facilities and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates  such as those seen recently in the far east  can impact both pricing and demand for the company s products as well as its cost of goods sold 
the company s offshore operations and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions and import and export controls  as well as changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for subcontract assembly services  can be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
environmental risks 
the company is subject to a variety of regulations related to hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended

the company s common stock and notes have experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock and the notes 
impact of year on the company s operations 
the company utilizes numerous software programs throughout its operations which include dates and make date sensitive calculations based on two digit fields which are assumed to begin with the year software programs written based on this assumption are vulnerable  as the year approaches  to miscalculations and other operational errors which may be significant to their overall effectiveness 
in addition  the company relies upon products and information from critical suppliers  large customers and other outside parties  in the normal course of business  whose software programs are also subject to the same problem 
should miscalculations or other operational errors occur as a result of the year issue  the company or the parties on which it depends may be unable to produce reliable information or process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worse case  the company or the parties on which it depends may  for an extended period of time  be incapable of conducting critical business activities  which include but are not limited to  manufacturing and shipping products  invoicing customers and paying vendors 
the company is assessing the extent to which year issues may be incorporated into certain products which it sells to its customers 
the company has also initiated communications with its critical suppliers  large customers and other outside parties in an effort to identify and mitigate year matters originating from dependent third parties which may adversely affect the company 
based on the company s continuing assessment  idt needs to replace or materially modify many of its software applications  including those critical to the company s normal operations  in order to both avoid significant year issues and meet the company s business requirements 
the company will continue to execute its existing plans to upgrade or replace software 
while year compliance is an important software feature which the company considers when purchasing software  the system upgrades and replacements purchased by the company also contain important functional improvements which are necessary for idt to be competitive as a multinational semiconductor manufacturing company 
by the year  over a five year period  the company will have replaced substantially all of its enterprise wide systems 
the company has not allocated a portion of the total project cost to the year issue 
idt does not believe the incremental project cost associated with year compliance to be material  as this feature is included with software purchased by the company to satisfy its business needs 
during the process of replacing  upgrading and reprogramming internal software programs  the company has formed  and continues to form  internal and external teams who are devoted to upgrading  replacing or modifying idt s existing programs  including those which are not year compliant 
these teams also test the results of their work to ensure effectiveness 
there can be no assurance  that all critical year problems have or will be identified or that the company will be able to procure all of the resources necessary to replace all critical year deficient software applications on a timely basis 
there can also be no assurance that the critical year deficient software programs of the parties on which the company depends will be converted on a timely basis or not converted to systems which are incompatible with the company s systems
