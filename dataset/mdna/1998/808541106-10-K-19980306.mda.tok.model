the businesses in france were conducted by ltri  a percent owned subsidiary of kimberly clark  and two indirect wholly owned kimberly clark subsidiaries  pdm and pdmal 
these latter two companies are owned by smf  previously named kimberly clark france sarl  which prior to the distribution was a wholly owned subsidiary of kimberly clark 
two kimberly clark consumer and service products c s businesses located in france  which were unrelated to the company and the businesses  were also subsidiaries of smf s predecessor 
the french c s subsidiaries were merged together and the shares of the merged entity were distributed to kimberly clark prior to the distribution 
smf  however  remained part of the company in order to permit pdm and pdmal to utilize substantial net operating loss carryforwards previously generated by the french c s operations 
the french c s businesses were operated and managed independently of the businesses  with totally separate facilities  no common sales forces or purchasing functions  no substantive intercompany transactions except in the ordinary course of managing kimberly clark s intercompany financing activities and no other commonalities

the company has declared and paid quarterly dividends  each amounting to million per share  since the second quarter of management currently expects to continue this level of quarterly dividend 
other than expenditures associated with environmental matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december  the company had unrecorded outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
in addition to capital spending  the company is incurring software development costs related to a new company wide integrated computer system that replaced in the us the formerly used kimberly clark systems beginning january the portion of software development costs which were capitalized totaled million in and  together with million capitalized in  were deferred on the balance sheet until such systems are placed in service see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the us  where the largest portion of the costs to date have been incurred  most of the deferred costs will begin amortizing at the beginning of over a period of seven years using the straight line method 
the company will continue to incur costs in france and  to a much lesser degree  in the us in and as software modules are designed and installed

this acquisition  while important to the strategic growth of the company and its ability to meet the demands of its customers  is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings still available under its revolving credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its ongoing cash requirements 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued two new statements  statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 reporting of comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which will both be effective for the company s annual report to stockholders 
these two new statements will affect the company s financial statement disclosures 
the company is evaluating how to implement these new disclosure requirements 
outlook during  the company expects to benefit from continued growth in sales volumes outside the us  reflecting increased demand for the company s products  and from cost savings as a result of recently implemented capital projects 
however  the higher corporate income tax rate in france is expected to negatively impact earnings by 
to 
per share compared with amortization of capitalized software costs related to the new integrated computer systems in the us will begin and is expected to reduce earnings by approximately 
per share in compared to additionally  operating expenses for the new computer network in the us over and above the amount previously paid to kimberly clark for utilization of its systems are expected to have an unfavorable effect of approximately 
per share in compared to start up costs in the first quarter of related to the new us computer systems will further reduce earnings by approximately 
per share 
the company will be integrating the brazilian and french acquisitions  which occurred in february  into swm during but does not expect either to begin contributing positively to earnings until also  the direction of the us cigarette market remains unclear at this time  given the potential tobacco settlement legislation  the effect of lower exports of cigarettes by the company s customers in the us and the continuing adverse publicity for the tobacco industry 
the per ton cost of wood pulp was relatively stable throughout  but the wood pulp market is weakening entering the company does not expect significant increases or decreases in the per ton cost of wood pulp during although per ton wood pulp costs may be somewhat lower during the first six months of the year 
the company expects to continue incurring due diligence costs  as it did in  as potential external growth opportunities are explored 
these kinds of costs vary significantly and cannot necessarily be predicted 
in summary  the company does not anticipate for the earnings increases experienced in and the company expects capital spending for to be approximately to million in total 
capital spending for  excluding that of acquired businesses  is estimated at approximately million  focused primarily on internal capacity expansion  cost reduction opportunities and upgrades to environmental treatment facilities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to capital spending  the company expects to incur approximately million of additional capitalized software costs in in the us  france and canada 
factors that may affect future results certain sections of this report  particularly the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company  contain certain forward looking statements  generally identified by phrases such as the company expects or words of similar effect 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that the results of the company will be as estimated 
many factors outside the control of the company also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
year compliance the year compliance issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own software and hardware systems and from third parties with whom the company transacts business around the world 
failure of the company or third parties to effectively handle the year issue could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct business after december  although the aforementioned company wide integrated corporate information systems project was initiated as a result of the company s need to replace the kimberly clark systems formerly used in the us  a benefit of the new systems is that they provide year compliance in the area of corporate information systems 
the company is in the process of developing a comprehensive plan to ensure that its manufacturing process systems  administrative systems  interfaces with vendor and customer systems and other areas will be ready for the year other than the costs related to the corporate information systems  management does not expect the costs which the company will incur to be year compliant to be material to the company s business  operations or financial condition 
international business risks the company s international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  exchange controls  inflationary economies  currency risks and risks related to the restrictions of repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
the company makes a comprehensive review of the income tax requirements of each of its operations  files appropriate returns and makes appropriate income tax planning analyses directed toward the minimization of its income tax obligations in these countries 
appropriate income tax provisions are determined on an individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
these processes are followed using an appropriate combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
dividend distributions are regularly made to the us from certain foreign subsidiaries and are appropriately considered in the provision for us income taxes 
the company intends for the undistributed earnings of certain other foreign subsidiaries to be reinvested indefinitely 
these undistributed earnings are not subject to either additional foreign income taxes or us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
the company regularly reviews the status of the accumulated earnings of each of its foreign subsidiaries and reevaluates the aforementioned dividend policy as part of its overall financing plans 
hedging activities and foreign currency exchange risks management selectively hedges the company s foreign currency risks  as well as its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt  when it is practical and economical to do so 
the instruments used to hedge foreign currency risks are forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
these instruments are purchased from well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually  the contracts extend for no more than months  although their contractual term has been as long as months 
management believes that credit risks with respect to the counterparties and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged  were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts  are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
in addition to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on operating profit  foreign currency losses have arisen from the remeasurement of non local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the operation is domiciled 
these losses  most of which related to receivables from and payables to affiliated companies unrelated to the businesses prior to the spin off  are included in other income expense net 
these receivables from and payables to such affiliated companies were settled as of the distribution date 
additional information concerning foreign currency related matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s cost structure 
effect of changing pulp costs pulp costs tend to be cyclical in nature and are a large component of product costs 
the company consumed approximately   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of the primary pulp grade used by the company  northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  ranged from a low of per metric ton to a high of per metric ton 
generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased pulp costs and has generally reduced them when pulp costs have significantly declined 
the company may or may not be able to fully recover future pulp cost increases  or fully retain future pulp cost decreases  in its sales pricing structure 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the us where customer shutdowns typically occurring in july and december have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air and water emissions and noise from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company  or its predecessor  has been named as a potentially responsible party at several waste disposal sites  none of which  individually  or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that such an effect will not occur at some future time 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company is involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in countries around the world 
one such customer has accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of such customer  or a significant reduction in that customer s purchases  could  at least temporarily  have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities  particularly in the us  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms 
the possibility of a legislative settlement of such litigation in the united states may affect demand for the company s products 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry 
nor is it possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
approximately percent of the company s net sales are from products used by the tobacco industry in the making of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition
