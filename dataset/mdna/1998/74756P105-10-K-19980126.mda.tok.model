the company recorded a  charge for expenses related to the franchise operating partner program during the second quarter of fiscal these costs were primarily related to the professional services of financial advisors involved in negotiating with potential equity investors for the franchise operating partner program

the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal was benefit compared to an income tax rate of in fiscal  primarily due to the operating losses experienced resulting in no federal income tax provision and a nominal state income tax provision 
the low income tax benefit rate is a result of a significant portion of the  non cash charge for asset impairment being non deductible for tax purposes 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million as well as fica tip credits and alternative minimum tax credits of million 
the net operating loss and tip credits expire in while the alternative minimum tax credits carryforward indefinitely

the company s assessment of its ability to realize the net deferred tax asset was based on the weight of both positive and negative evidence  including the taxable income of the non bagel related concepts 
based on this assessment  the company s management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax benefit recorded will be realized 
such evidence will be reviewed prospectively and should the company s operating performance continue to improve  the company may recognize additional tax benefits related to its net deferred tax asset position in the future 
the net loss in fiscal was  or per share compared to net income of  or per share in fiscal strong revenue growth in fiscal was more than offset by the special charges noted above

liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s principal sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands fiscal year ended october  october  october  net cash provided by operations    nonoperating sources of cash proceeds from sale of common stock  net   borrowings of long term debt    disposition of businesses  net of cash sold  nonoperating uses of cash acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired   purchase of property and equipment    repayment of long term debt    advances to affiliates   in fiscal cash provided by operations decreased to  from  in fiscal due to poor operational performance at the company s bagel related restaurants  the significant increase in costs associated with the development of corporate infrastructure designed to support the anticipated aggressive development of the bruegger s brand and increased interest expense due to borrowings under the company s credit facility 
on october  the company sold the bagel related businesses and implemented a staff reduction plan which has eliminated a significant number of corporate positions 
the company s primary cash requirements in fiscal will be to finance capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants  remodeling of existing restaurants  maintenance expenditures and the reduction of debt under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s capital expenditures budget is expected to range from  to  for fiscal during fiscal  the company anticipates opening three burger king restaurants 
the actual amount of the company s cash requirements for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new restaurants opened and the actual expense related to remodeling and maintenance of existing units 
on october   the company amended its revolving credit agreement with texas commerce bank  as agent for a group of seven banks  providing for borrowings of up to  with interest payable at the adjusted libor rate plus a contractual spread at october  
the revolving credit agreement expires on april  and is supported by the pledge of the stock of certain subsidiaries of the company 
as of october   there was  outstanding under this revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains  among other provisions  certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of certain prescribed debt and fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum levels of tangible net worth  limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  limitations on consolidated capital expenditures and restrictions on the payment of dividends other than stock dividends on  or the purchase or redemption of  any shares of the company s capital stock 
in addition  the revolving credit agreement contains a mandatory reduction in borrowing availability to  by december  the company has a significant amount of debt subject to floating interest rates 
therefore  any increase in interest rates would have an adverse effect on the company 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations  together with amounts available under its revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund its planned internal expansion and other internal operating cash requirements through the end of fiscal recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
this new standard requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the statement of earnings for all entities with complex capital structures 
adoption of sfas no 
is required for fiscal early adoption is not permitted 
there will be no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations due to the adoption of sfas no 
and diluted eps including the effects of common stock equivalents is not anticipated to be materially different than basic eps 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants 
impact of year the company relies to a large extent on computer technology to carry out its day to day operations 
many software products in the marketplace are only able to recognize a two digit year date and therefore will recognize a date using as the year instead of the year this problem could result in significant transactional inaccuracies and could even cause the system to stop operating 
as the year approaches  the company has begun to evaluate its current computer systems in order to determine what modifications  if any  are necessary to make its information systems and software capable of recognizing and processing the year the company anticipates that it will substantially complete its evaluation during fiscal and then begin to make the necessary upgrades or replacements to its computer systems 
until its assessment is complete  the company is unable to estimate whether the costs associated with year issue will have a material effect on the company s business  financial position or results of operations 
this report contains certain forward looking statements  including statements about the company s development plans  that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the availability and cost of suitable locations for new restaurants  the availability of capital to the company  the ability of the company to develop and operate its restaurants  the hiring  training and retention of skilled corporate and restaurant management and other restaurant personnel  the integration and assimilation of acquired concepts  the overall success of the company s franchisors  the ability to obtain the necessary government approvals and third party consents  the ability of the company to modify or redesign its computer systems to work properly in the year  and changes in governmental regulations  including increases in the minimum wage
