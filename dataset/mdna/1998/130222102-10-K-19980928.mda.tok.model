liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through nonrecourse debt and internally generated funds 
capital expenditures for leased property purchases are primarily financed by assigning the lease payments to banks or other financial institutions 
the lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
the company does not purchase property until it has received a noncancelable lease from its customer and  generally  has determined that the lease can be discounted on a nonrecourse basis 
at june   the company had outstanding nonrecourse debt aggregating  relating to property under capital and operating leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate nonrecourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future

from time to time  the company retains leases in its own portfolio rather than assigning the leases to financial institutions 
during the fiscal year  the company decreased its net investment in leases by  this decrease was primarily due to fewer new lease transactions being held in the company s own lease portfolio 
the company generally funds its equity investments in leased property and interim purchases with internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings under a  general line of credit 
at june   the company did not have any borrowings on this line of credit 
in november  the board of directors authorized management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
during the year ended june   the company did not repurchase any common stock 
during the year ended june   the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  as of september    shares remain available under this authorization 
the need for cash used for operating activities will continue to grow as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  available borrowings under its existing credit facility  and assignments on a nonrecourse basis of anticipated lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
year the year issue yk is a problem that relates to the way that computers store  manipulate  and interpret dates that define the year using only two digits 
these systems may experience problems handling dates beyond and therefore  could cause computer or other systems to fail or provide erroneous results 
date information can exist at any level of hardware or software from micro code to application programs  in files and databases  and might be present on any operating platform 
the company has addressed this issue by implementing a program which will attempt to assess  remediate and mitigate the potential impact of the yk problem 
the company is in the process of systematically determining yk compliance of its computer related hardware  major application software programs  externally supplied software  and major debt source vendors and customer compliance 
the company has substantially completed its assessment of its internal hardware and major software application programs and determined that the company is in material compliance with most of its internal systems 
for those systems in noncompliance  the company is in the process of either upgrading or replacing those systems to current yk compliance standards 
the costs associated with this program are not anticipated to be material and should fall within normal operating costs of maintaining those systems 
management believes that the company s internal systems will be in substantial compliance with the yk problems prior to the year and that the company should not have a material business risk as a result of this issue 
the company is in the process of monitoring its major suppliers  service providers  debt sources and customers  over which the company has no control  to determine that they address their own yk issues 
if appropriate modifications are not made by them on a timely basis  the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected
