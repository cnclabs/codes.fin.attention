in fiscal  the company began commercial sales under a private label arrangement 
in fiscal  the company also began marketing products under the rochester medical brand 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the statements of operations of the company expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal years ended september  net sales private label rochester medical brand total net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses marketing and selling research and development general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net net loss fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase results from sales growth in both rochester medical brand and private label products 
sales of rochester medical brand products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting growth of in domestic sales and in international sales 
virtually all of the domestic growth in branded sales was from sales of the company s standard products  for which marketing efforts have been progressively increased by the recently expanded field sales force 
sales to private label customers increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales to convatec  mentor and hollister accounted for  and  respectively  of fiscal net sales compared to  and  respectively  in fiscal gross margin 
the company s gross margin was in fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross margin rate has been adversely impacted by expansion of production facilities and support operations  shift in product mix toward lower margin products and increases in production wage rates 
the company expects continued downward pressure on gross margins in future periods associated with additional depreciation and other capacity expansion and production scale up costs 
the trend of reduced margins is expected to continue until such time  if ever  the company is able to increase utilization of the expanded manufacturing facilities  and increase sales levels of its higher margin release nf product line 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased expense is due primarily to market introduction costs for the release nf catheter  expansion of the domestic field sales force and costs associated with the addition of two new sales and marketing management personnel 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the primary activity affecting research and development expense levels is the ongoing clinical testing for the femsoft insert 
general and administrative

net interest income increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in net interest income in fiscal is a result of investment of net proceeds from the company s november public stock offering and repayment of a convertible note to convatec see liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to growth in sales of both rochester medical brand and private label products 
sales of rochester medical brand products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting growth in domestic branded sales and growth in international branded sales 
private label sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales to convatec  hollister and mentor accounted  respectively  for  and of fiscal net sales compared  respectively  to  and of fiscal net sales 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal gross margin benefited from manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher production volumes 
the company expects gross margin to be reduced in future periods by depreciation and other expenses associated with the expansion and scale up of the company s manufacturing facilities 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increased expense reflects expansion of the company s domestic direct sales organization and increased product promotion spending  in particular increased marketing and selling activities for rochester medical brand products 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to incremental costs associated with clinical studies for new products  in particular the femsoft insert 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to requirements for business and administrative infrastructure development to support current and anticipated growth 
interest income expense  net 
interest income decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  as a result of earnings on lower levels of cash available for investment 
interest expense in fiscal and fiscal related to the convertible note to convatec that the company repaid on september  liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of its equity securities  and has raised approximately million in net proceeds since its inception 
in august  the company received proceeds of million from issuance of a convertible note to convatec 
the company repaid the convatec note on september   with accrued interest  for a total amount of million 
as of september   the company had total cash and marketable securities of million  a net increase of million compared to september  the company used a net million of cash to fund operating activities during fiscal  primarily reflecting the net loss before non cash depreciation charges  and a net increase in working capital assets of million 
capital expenditures of million were made during fiscal  substantially all of which relate to completion of the company s production facilities expansion 
the company completed a public stock offering in november  that raised net proceeds of million 
the company intends to use approximately million during the coming year for expansion of production infrastructure  primarily to increase release nf and foley catheter production capacity and to upgrade business and manufacturing information systems 
the company also intends to expend substantial funds for product research and development  expansion of sales and marketing activities  product education efforts  advertising and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
although the company believes that its existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy its capital needs for approximately the next two years  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing before that time 
the company s actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  for the femsoft insert  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of the company s existing and new products  changes in  termination of  and the success of  existing and new distribution arrangements  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of the company s research and development efforts  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
the year issue may also affect computer chips that process data sensitive information which are embedded in computer hardware and machinery 
any computer programs and hardware or equipment that have date sensitive software or chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company utilizes a variety of computer programs for its systems of manufacturing  distribution and administration 
in addition  certain of the company s plant and manufacturing equipment contains date sensitive memory chips 
the company is presently conducting an assessment of its computer programs and equipment 
the company has made inquiries of its vendors who provide the company with computer programs and equipment  including hardware and software used in the company s automated manufacturing processes 
the company has also recently hired a consultant to assist the company with its assessment 
based upon results of that assessment to date and upon certifications and assurances received from its software vendors  the company has reviewed a majority of its computer programs and equipment and has not identified any programs or equipment that are not year compliant 
the company anticipates that it will be able to complete the assessment and implement any necessary modifications during calendar during its assessment to date  the company has not identified any material costs related to year issues 
if for any reason  however  the ongoing assessment discovers that the computer programs or equipment have a component that is not year compliant and the company is unable to implement necessary modifications on a cost effective or timely basis  the company could experience a significant operational issue that could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
such impacts could include disruptions in one or more of the company s manufacturing processes resulting in delays in production and the company s inability to manufacture and deliver product to fulfill customer orders 
in addition  each company with which the company conducts business  such as banks  payroll processors  vendors and customers  must address their own year issues 
the failure of these companies to be year compliant may affect the ability of the company  among other things  to obtain critical supplies or receive payment on outstanding invoices 
depending on the extent of such issues  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the company has used its own personnel to make inquiries to vendors and to begin the year assessment process 
other than such personnel expenses  the company estimates that it has spent to date less than  on year compliance issues 
the company cannot now estimate the costs it may be required to incur in order to resolve any such compliance issues which may be disclosed as a result of its assessment procedures being undertaken by the company 
specific factors that might cause such material expenditures not now anticipated by the company include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the validity of certifications and assurances furnished by software vendors  the effectiveness of software upgrades received by the company from its software vendors  the results of the ongoing assessment and similar uncertainties 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event issues are encountered with year compliance 
the company intends to further evaluate the status of year compliance in march and determine at that time whether a contingency plan is necessary 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
the fasb also issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which significantly changes the way segment information is reported in annual financial statements and also requires selected segment information in interim financial reports to shareholders 
both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  based on current circumstances  the company does not believe the effect of adoption is material to the financial statements 
business outlook the following discussion  as well as certain information presented elsewhere in this form k  including statements made in the sections captioned business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  predict  intend  designed  estimate  should or continue or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
such forward looking statements involve known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following the lack and uncertainty of regulatory approval for the company s products in development  primarily the femsoft insert  the uncertainty of market acceptance of the release nf catheter and femsoft insert  the risks associated with the company s expanded reliance on sales of rochester medical brand products and the company s limited sales and marketing experience with rochester medical brand product sales  the company s history of losses and uncertainty of profitability  the company s dependence on a small number of private label distributors for the majority of its sales  the company s dependence on limited or single sources of supply for critical raw materials  uncertainties associated with beginning production on the company s new liquid encapsulation manufacturing line and expanded foley catheter and male external catheter manufacturing lines  the company s highly competitive industry and risks that advances in alternative treatments or products could make the company s products obsolete  changes in  or failure to comply with  government regulations  the uncertainty of third party reimbursement for certain of the company s products  the company s dependence on and the uncertainty of patent and proprietary technology protection  possible product liability litigation  potential fluctuations in the company s quarterly results  the company s dependence on key employees  general economic and business conditions  and other factors referenced in this form k 
the company believes that it has begun to benefit from the recent and growing market preference for non latex products  particularly with increased demand for its silicone foley catheters 
new fda labeling regulations that became mandatory in september  require that latex products contain a warning label as to the inherent risks associated with latex product use 
in light of these inherent risks  many customers and medical institutions are now seeking non latex alternatives such as those the company offers 
since receiving fda marketing approval for the release nf catheter in january   the company has been engaged in market introduction activities domestically and in pursuing regulatory approvals  including ce mark  for introduction into overseas markets 
following initial presentation of the release nf catheter at a series of medical trade shows and conventions in may of this year  the company has focused its selling efforts on negotiating contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos and on securing product evaluations in medical institutions 
these activities are generally considered prerequisites to obtaining order volumes of any significance when introducing a new medical product into the hospital market 
typically  the selling process includes i making the product available under group contract  ii introducing the product directly at medical institutions to secure an evaluation iii gaining acceptance of the product by institution s product review committee following successful trial and evaluation  and iv securing product orders 
the company believes the release nf catheter will be undergoing such product evaluations at a number of major medical institutions in the coming months  and that the results of such evaluations will be a principal consideration in decisions by such institutions whether or not to purchase the product 
such evaluations  moreover  do not necessarily conform to scientifically designed protocols and may yield results adversely affecting purchasing decisions 
market acceptance of the release nf catheter  and sales thereof  will depend in large part on the company s ability to secure participation under gpo contracts  its ability to secure hospital trials of the product  and the results of such hospital trials  none of which can be predicted 
the company has increased foley catheter production capacity during the current quarter with the addition of peripheral manufacturing equipment and the expansion of the production work force 
the increase was undertaken in response to an increase in order volumes for the company s silicone foley catheters  as well as in anticipation of manufacturing capacity requirements for the release nf catheter 
aside from the foley catheter production area  the company expects to experience excess capacity costs  including depreciation charges  associated with its new manufacturing facilities  which will affect margins until such time as sales volumes provide a level of utilization to absorb these costs 
the company intends to continue expanding its domestic field force for branded products and to further develop its international branded product sales activities 
since revising its agreement with convatec in may  the company has begun marketing efforts to expand its base of customers in major international markets now accessible under private label 
mentor corporation  one of the company s largest private label customers  has recently advised rochester medical of its intention to manufacture its own silicone male external catheters under a royalty free license it holds from the company 
in light of its revised agreement with convatec and the potential for declines in sales to mentor  the company will seek to enter into private label agreements with new customers 
the company s expense levels are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
the labor market for medical device manufacturing personnel has tightend in minnesota  and paricularly in the rochester area where the company s manufacturing facilities are located 
this has resulted in upward pressure on wages for production workers but has not  to date  adversely affected the company s ability to hire and retain capable manufacturing personnel 
the company is satisfied with the progress of the femsoft insert clinical trials and with the results of its pma presubmission conference with the fda 
the company believes that the interim clinical trial results derived to date are statistically significant and predictive of the results to be derived from the continuing study  and therefore the company plans to submit a pma application in the near future 
the company cannot estimate the time that will be required for fda review following the submission  nor can the company predict the fda s response to that submission 
risk factors uncertainty of market acceptance of new products much of the company s ability to increase revenues and to achieve profitability and positive cash flow will depend on the successful introduction of its products and products in development  including the release nf catheter which has recently been commercially introduced or the femsoft insert which has not yet been commercially introduced 
both of these products represent new methods for urinary continence care 
there can be no assurance that these products will gain any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians  healthcare payors and patients  even after all regulatory and reimbursement approvals have been obtained 
the company believes that recommendations by physicians and clinicians will be essential for the market acceptance of these products and there can be no assurance that any such recommendations will be obtained 
broad market acceptance of the company s advanced products  including the release nf catheter and the femsoft insert  may require lengthy hospital evaluations and or the training of numerous physicians and clinicians 
the time required to complete such evaluations and or such training could result in a delay or dampening of such market acceptance 
moreover  health care payors approval of reimbursement for the company s products and products in development will be an important factor in establishing market acceptance 
patient acceptance of these products will depend on many factors  including physician recommendations  the degree  rate and severity of potential complications  the cost and benefits compared to competing products or alternative medical treatments  lifestyle implications  available reimbursement and other considerations 
in addition  the company has not yet determined final pricing for all of these products  and the company s pricing policies could adversely impact market acceptance of these products as compared to competing products and alternative treatments 
any of the foregoing factors  or other factors  could limit or detract from market acceptance of these products 
insufficient market acceptance of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with marketing and sales of rochester medical brand products to date  the company has depended to a significant extent on marketing its continence care products under private label arrangements 
a key element of the company s business strategy is to pursue sales growth of its rochester medical brand products  and to develop market recognition for the brand to support the market introduction of the release nf catheter and the future market introduction of the femsoft insert  as well as other products in development 
the success of the company s strategy will depend on its ability to overcome established market positions of competitors and to establish its own market presence 
the company is actively pursuing sales of its current rochester medical brand products through a dedicated domestic sales force  and is engaged in developing market strategies for its planned rochester medical brand products  particularly the femsoft insert 
one of the challenges facing the company in this respect is the need to obtain inclusion under healthcare group purchase arrangements 
healthcare purchasing is becoming increasingly centralized  which may put the company at a disadvantage compared to companies with a wider array of products 
to date  the company has obtained inclusion under two such contracts 
in addition  many purchasers of urine drainage catheters prefer to purchase such catheters packaged in a tray  which is a single container including a catheter and related accessories  such as collection bags 
the company currently offers only the release nf catheter in trays 
not also offering its other urine drainage products in kits or trays can be a competitive disadvantage with potential customers who prefer such packaging 
although the company may address this disadvantage in the future  the company does not currently have a supply arrangement for tray components at prices which would permit its standard  lower margin products to be offered in trays 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in marketing its products under the rochester medical brand  will further develop its marketing and sales force to expand its sales activities  or obtain inclusion in additional group purchasing contracts 
moreover  the femsoft insert  if approved by the fda and introduced commercially  may require the company to undertake extensive educational efforts directed to physicians and clinicians and significant media advertising directed to consumers 
the company has no previous experience with such educational efforts or consumer oriented media advertising  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such activities 
the company has entered into collaborative arrangements with a number of distributors providing for the marketing and sale of certain of the company s products in various international markets 
in general  pursuant to these agreements  the company is required to provide quantities of its products for sale by its distributors  and the company s distributors are required to use their best efforts to market and sell the company s products in their respective markets 
failure by the company s distributors to effectively market the company s products in their respective markets could have a material adverse effect on the company 
lack of regulatory approval the company believes that regulatory approvals for its products in development  particularly the femsoft insert  are materially important to the company 
the production and marketing of the company s products in development  including femsoft insert  and certain of the company s ongoing research and development activities are subject to regulation by numerous government authorities in the united states and other countries 
the femsoft insert has not been authorized for commercial distribution in the united states or any foreign country  and will require fda authorization before the company may begin marketing it in the united states as well as similar authorization from appropriate regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions prior to commercialization in such jurisdictions 
the process of obtaining fda and other domestic and foreign regulatory authorization is unpredictable and often lengthy  and there can be no assurance that the fda or any other regulatory body will grant authorization any product in a timely manner  if at all 
the company intends to submit a pma for the femsoft insert based on data derived from an ongoing multi site clinical trial 
there can be no assurance that such trials when completed will yield data that support the safety and efficacy of the femsoft insert or that such clinical trials  fda review or continued development efforts  will not identify technical  manufacturing  design or other obstacles that could delay submitting a pma 
if the femsoft insert is not determined by the fda to be safe and effective  or if the company otherwise fails to obtain fda approval of the femsoft insert  or if the company experiences a significant delay or unforeseen expenditure in the course of attempting to obtain such approval  scaling up manufacturing  or marketing such product  if approved  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company is pursuing ce mark certification for the release nf catheter to permit the company to market the catheter in member countries of the eu 
due to the drug release component of the release nf catheter  this certification procedure is a more complex  lengthy and uncertain procedure than the company has undergone to date in connection with ce certification of its other products 
the company cannot estimate the length of time that will be required to complete the ce certification procedure for the nf release catheter  and the company cannot predict the outcome of that procedure 
if the company cannot obtain ce mark certification for the release nf catheter  company s results of operations will likely be affected 
limited revenues  history of losses and anticipated future losses the company has generated only limited revenues to date and has experienced net losses since its inception 
net losses for the fiscal years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at september  the company s ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flow will depend in part upon the company s ability to complete development of  and or successfully introduce  new products  particularly the release nf catheter and femsoft insert  of which there can be no assurance 
the company expects to incur substantial expenses for commercialization of the release nf catheter  and for clinical testing  development and commercialization of the femsoft insert  as well as for other new products and products in development 
in addition  the company anticipates increased operating expenses as it expands its sales and marketing organization and activities 
the company will also experience additional manufacturing expenses in connection with the ongoing expansion and scale up of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
a substantial portion of the expenses associated with the expansion and scale up of the company s manufacturing facilities are fixed in nature ie depreciation and will reduce the company s operating margin until such time  if ever  as the company is able to increase utilization of such expanded capacity 
as a result  the company expects to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future and there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate substantial revenues or achieve or sustain profitability 
highly competitive markets  alternative treatments  technological advancements the medical products market in general is  and the markets for urinary continence care products in particular are  highly competitive 
the company s ability to compete in the urinary continence care market depends primarily on price  product quality and features  technical capability  breadth of product line and distribution capabilities 
many of the company s competitors have greater name recognition than the company and offer well known and established products  some of which are less expensive than the company s products 
as a result  even if the company can demonstrate that its products provide greater ease of use  lifestyle improvement or beneficial effects on medical outcomes over the course of treatment  the company may not be successful in capturing a significant share of the market 
in addition  many of the company s competitors offer broader product lines than the company  which may be a competitive advantage in obtaining contracts with healthcare purchasing groups  and may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain contracts with such purchasing groups 
the company relies to a large extent on distribution relationships that include the company s products  both those sold under private label arrangements and those marketed under the rochester medical brand  as part of broader product offerings 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or that they will be successful in inducing significant purchasers to buy the company s products 
additionally  many of the company s competitors have substantially more marketing and sales experience than the company and substantially greater resources to devote to such efforts 
finally  other factors within and outside the company s control will also affect its ability to compete  including its product development and innovation capabilities  its ability to obtain required regulatory clearances  its ability to protect the proprietary technology included in its products and manufacturing processes  its manufacturing and marketing capabilities and its ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete against such competitors or against potential competitors  or that competition in the company s markets will not result in pricing pressures that would adversely affect the company s unit prices and sales levels any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the company s products  urinary continence care can be managed with a variety of alternative medical treatments and management products or techniques  including adult diapers and absorbent pads  surgery  behavior therapy  pelvic muscle exercise  implantable devices  injectable materials and other medical devices 
moreover  manufacturers of products similar to the company s are engaged in research to develop more advanced versions of current products 
many of the companies that are engaged in such development work have substantially greater capital resources than the company and greater expertise than the company in research  development and regulatory matters 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be able to compete with existing or future alternative products  techniques or therapies  or that advancements in existing products  techniques or therapies will not render the company s products obsolete 
finally  the company s urinary dysfunction products are management options  not a permanent cure 
the development of a cure for urinary dysfunction would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on distribution arrangements a significant portion of the company s net sales to date have depended on the company s ability to provide products that meet the requirements of medical product companies with which the company has private label or distribution arrangements  and on the sales and marketing efforts of such entities 
these arrangements are likely to continue to be a significant portion of the company s revenues in the future 
private label arrangements with medical products companies accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company will also continue to establish additional distribution arrangements for private label sales and distribution arrangements for rochester medical brand products 
there can be no assurance that the company s private label purchasers and other distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the company s products  that they will devote sufficient resources to support the marketing of any of the company s products  or that they will market any of the company s products at prices which will permit such products to develop  achieve  or sustain market acceptance 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s private label or other distributors will continue to purchase significant amounts of product from the company 
the company cannot forecast with any reasonable degree of assurance the amount of future purchases  if any  by convatec  which represented of net sales during fiscal  or by mentor  which represented of net sales during fiscal the failure of the company s private label purchasers or other distributors to continue to purchase products from the company at levels reasonably consistent with their prior purchases or to effectively market the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  in addition to the restrictions and obligations described below  the private label agreements impose certain obligations upon the company relating to  among others  delivery of commercial quantities of its products  delivery of products in accordance with specifications  the maintenance of product liability insurance and certain indemnification obligations 
the failure or inability of the company to comply with the terms of these agreements could permit the company s private label purchasers and other distributors to terminate their respective agreements 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of these private label purchasers or other distributors will perform its obligations under its respective agreement with the company 
any such termination or abandonment could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to market and sell its products 
the company s distribution agreement with convatec generally precludes the company from distributing male external catheters through any other private label purchaser in the territories of central america  south america  australia  japan  new zealand  south africa  israel  iran  iraq  lebanon  oman  saudi arabia  syria  united arab emirates and yemen  although the company may market such products under its own brand in such territories 
the company is also party to a private label agreement with mentor pursuant to which the company granted mentor a non exclusive  paid up  royalty free license to make  use and sell the silicone external catheters that mentor now purchases from the company 
as a result  there can be no assurance that mentor will not begin to manufacture the silicone external catheter itself and discontinue its purchase and marketing of the company s product 
such discontinuation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
mentor has recently introduced a new non silicone  non latex male external catheter which it manufactures itself 
the company cannot now estimate the impact  if any  of this new device on mentor s future purchase of silicone male external catheters from the company 
the company is also aware that mentor has recently built a catheter manufacturing facility for the production of silicone catheters such as it now purchases from the company 
there can be no assurance that mentor will continue purchasing products from the company at such levels  or at all  in the future 
in addition  sales of the company s products under its private label arrangements compete with sales of the company s rochester medical brand products 
such competition might have an adverse effect on the company s ability to establish its rochester medical brand or on the company s margins 
possible need for additional capital the company intends to expend substantial funds for expansion of sales and marketing activities  product education efforts  advertising and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
although the company believes its existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its capital needs for approximately the next two years  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing before that time 
the company s actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  for the femsoft insert  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of the company s existing and new products  including the release nf catheter  changes in  termination of  and the success of  existing and new distribution arrangements  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments relating to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of the company s research and development efforts  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborate relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
dependence on single or limited sources of supply the company is dependent upon dow corning corporation dow corning and general electric corporation ge for raw materials used in the manufacture of certain of its silicone products 
dow corning is currently in bankruptcy proceedings and there can be no assurance that dow corning will continue to manufacture silicone or to supply silicone to medical device manufacturers  including the company 
to date  the company has fulfilled its requirements for nitrofurazone and for catheter trays  which are each used for the release nf catheter  through a single distributor of each such component  and the company has fulfilled its requirements for block co polymers used in its non silicone  non latex catheters 
although the company is aware of other distributors who are able to supply nitrofurazone  catheter trays or block co polymers  the company does not currently have arrangements for alternative supplies 
if the company were to lose its current suppliers of any of these materials or components  it would be required to identify a new supplier for that material  repeat biocompatibility testing of its products using the raw materials from the new supplier  might be required to seek additional regulatory clearance or might incur additional costs for such components 
the loss of any such supplier or any significant decrease or interruption in supply could interrupt the manufacture of the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the significance of product liability litigation to suppliers of raw materials used in the manufacture of medical devices has caused such suppliers to carefully evaluate the use of those raw materials in certain medical devices 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers might not in the future change their policies regarding raw materials usage  or that such a change  if it occurred  might not adversely affect production of the company s then current products or its product development activities 
uncertainties associated with manufacturing facilities the company has completed installation of equipment and components necessary to equip its recently constructed liquid encapsulation manufacturing facility for initial production requirements  and is presently refining process parameters and debugging and validating the manufacturing processes for the femsoft insert in preparation for commercially scaled production 
in connection with its pma application for the femsoft insert  the fda will inspect the company s new liquid encapsulation manufacturing facilities  processes and record keeping systems 
in addition  those same facilities will be required to undergo a separate inspection by designated representatives of the european union for ce mark certification for the femsoft insert as a condition for selling that product in the eu 
the company may encounter delays and technical difficulties  along with associated cost over runs while seeking to obtain regulatory approval for  and beginning commercial production on the new production lines  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the new facilities will enable the company to produce the quantities of products required for commercialization in the united states and abroad 
the inability to produce products in such quantities or to utilize such new capacity fully could have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of government regulation the company s products  product development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for such products 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance for new medical products from the fda can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearance will be granted timely  if at all  for the company s products in development  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or to expand permitted uses of existing products 
even if regulatory clearance to market a product is obtained from the fda  this clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
marketing clearance can also be withdrawn by the fda due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance 
the company may be required to make further filings with the fda under certain circumstances  such as the addition of product claims or product reformulation 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretation made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  which may have retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the fda and various state agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations relating to medical device manufacturing companies  including regulations concerning manufacturing  testing  quality control and product labeling practices 
a determination that the company is in material violation of such regulations could lead to the imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls  product seizures  or  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
a portion of the company s revenues are dependent upon sales of its products outside the united states 
foreign regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the company relies on its third party foreign distributors to comply with certain foreign regulatory requirements 
the inability or failure of the company or such foreign distributors to comply with varying foreign regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the sale of the company s products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party reimbursement the company s products are purchased by hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payors  such as government health programs  private health insurance plans  managed care organizations and other similar programs  for the health care products and services provided to their patients 
payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not used in accordance with established payor protocols regarding cost efficient treatment methods  was used for an unapproved indication or was not otherwise covered 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and  in some instances  have pressured medical suppliers to lower their prices 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors 
there can be no assurance that treatments utilizing the company s products will be considered cost effective by third party payors  that reimbursement for such treatments will be available or  if available  that payor reimbursement levels will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
moreover  medicare  medicaid and private third party payors may limit reimbursement for disposable devices such as those manufactured by the company by implementing fee schedules or by allowing reimbursement for only a fixed number of devices per month 
in addition  healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade  and there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payors to curb these costs 
the company is currently unable to comprehensively assess the eligibility of the femsoft insert for reimbursement 
failure by users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  changes in third party payors policies towards reimbursement for the company s products or legislative action limiting reimbursement for certain procedures or products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights the company s success may depend in part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and manufacturing processes  to preserve its trade secrets  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
no assurance can be given that the scope of any patent protection under the company s current patents  or under any patent the company might obtain in the future  will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology  current or future products or activities will not be deemed to infringe upon the rights of others 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products or manufacturing processes  duplicate any of the company s products or manufacturing processes  or design around the company s patents 
the company also relies upon unpatented trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology or disclose such technology or that the company can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
the medical device industry is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation  particularly with respect to newly developed technology 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel 
as a result  a claim by a third party that the company s current products or products in development allegedly infringe its patent rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  an adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from such parties  if licenses to such rights could be obtained  and or require the company to cease using such technology 
if third party patents containing claims affecting the company s technology were issued and such claims were determined to be valid  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain licenses to such patents at costs reasonable to the company  if at all  or be able to develop or obtain alternate technology 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing  using or selling certain of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possibility of product liability litigation  possible inadequacy of insurance the medical products industry is subject to substantial product liability litigation  and the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects to a patient 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company  including on market acceptance of its products 
the company maintains general insurance policies that include coverage for product liability claims 
the policies are limited to an aggregate maximum of million per product liability claim  with an annual aggregate limit of million under the policies 
the company may require increased product liability coverage as new products are developed and commercialized 
there can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limits of the company s policies or that adequate insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company is dependent upon anthony j 
conway  the company s chief executive officer and president  and upon philip j 
conway and richard d 
fryar  vice presidents of the company  who together perform the substantial majority of the company s research and development efforts as well as perform various management functions 
additionally  the company is dependent on the services of brian j 
wierzbinski  the company s chief financial officer  as well as on the services of randy c 
dennis  the company s principal marketing and sales officer 
the company also depends on its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
additionally  the company s future success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled and unskilled production personnel in accordance with future sales volumes 
the company faces intense competition for qualified personnel in all of the aforementioned areas  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the current management group or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could impair the company s ability to commercialize and manufacture its products or to develop new products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly financial performance the company may experience significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis in the future 
quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  of the femsoft insert  the timing and level of market acceptance  if any  of the release nf catheter and femsoft insert  the timing and level of expenditures associated with new product development activities  the timing and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities and overall operations  the company s ability to maintain consistently acceptable yields in the manufacture of continence care products  the success of the activities conducted under private label arrangements  changes in demand for the company s products based on changes in third party reimbursement  competition  changes in government regulation and other factors  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  and general economic conditions 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly demand for products and order cancellations may adversely affect the continuity of the company s manufacturing operations  increase uncertainty in operational planning  disrupt cash flow from operations and contribute to the volatility of the company s stock price 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if actual revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
potential volatility of stock price in recent years  the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected medical technology companies  resulting in changes in the market prices of the stocks of many companies which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies 
factors such as variations in the company s financial performance  changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding the company  announcements of technological innovations by the company  its competitors or providers of alternative products  therapies or results of clinical trials or other regulatory or reimbursement developments relating to the company could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
broad market fluctuations  or other factors affecting the market prices of the stocks of medical technology companies generally  may adversely affect the market price of the common stock
