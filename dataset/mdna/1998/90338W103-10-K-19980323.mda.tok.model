changes in results of operations year to year were caused in part by affiliations with these oncology practices 
overall  the company experienced a decrease in operating margins from to  with earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as a percentage of revenue  declining from to 
a number of factors contributed to the decrease in operating margins  including i the introduction of a number of chemotherapy agents that are used in combination with or in addition to existing therapies  some of which have significantly lower margins than existing chemotherapy regimens  ii difficulty in efficiently integrating practices that affiliated with the company in late and and iii higher discounts to managed care payors 
the company benefited  however  from lower general and administrative costs  practice compensation and benefits and other practice costs  in each case as a percentage of revenue 
to address the decline in margins  the company has adopted a number of strategies  including enhancing purchasing power by initiating preferred pharmaceutical relationships on behalf of its affiliated physician groups

revenue for markets under management in and increased million or over the same period from the prior year 
the methodology for calculating same market growth is a change from the same practice growth disclosed in prior periods 
the company changed the methodology to more accurately reflect the revenue growth of a market from period to period as well as the changing structure of new physician transactions in under the new method  revenue growth for all practices within a metropolitan service area in which the company has operations in both periods is treated as same market growth 
under the old methodology  the same practice growth for over the comparable period in would have been a increase in revenue 
this growth was the result of expansion of services  increases in patient volume  recruitment of or affiliation with additional physicians and  to a lesser extent  increases in charges for certain physician services

management expects that third party payors will continue to negotiate the reimbursement rate for medical services  pharmaceuticals including chemotherapy drugs and other supplies  with the goal of lowering reimbursement and utilization rates  and that such lower reimbursement and utilization rates as well as shifts in revenue mix may continue to adversely impact the company s margins with respect to such items

all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time on behalf of the company 
growth strategy  rapid growth 
one of the company s strategies is to grow through transactions with additional oncology groups and through the expansion of its affiliated physician groups 
identifying appropriate physician groups and proposing  negotiating and implementing economically attractive affiliations with them can be a lengthy  complex and costly process 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying and establishing relationships with additional oncology groups 
the company has experienced rapid growth in its business and staff 
continued rapid growth may impair the company s ability to efficiently provide its management services to its affiliated physician groups and to adequately manage and supervise its employees 
the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is unable to manage growth effectively 
in the event that the company is successful in establishing relationships with additional physician groups  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate the operations of such groups or to institute company wide systems and procedures to operate as a combined enterprise with such groups 
in addition  a strategy of growth by acquisition or affiliation involves the risk of assuming unknown or contingent liabilities of the affiliated physician groups  which could be material  individually or in the aggregate 
any failure by the company to successfully integrate newly affiliated physician groups or to effectively insulate itself from unwanted liabilities of such groups may have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
another strategy of the company is to develop integrated cancer centers 
the development of integrated cancer centers is subject to a number of risks  including i obtaining regulatory approval  including certificates of need in some states  ii delays that often accompany construction of facilities and iii environmental liabilities that attach to ownership  lease or operation of real property 
any failure or delay by the company to successfully build and operate integrated cancer centers or to effectively insulate itself from liabilities arising from operating these centers may have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
dependence on affiliated physician groups 
the company s revenue depends on revenue generated by the company s affiliated physician groups 
there can be no assurance that existing and future physician groups with which the company affiliates will maintain successful medical practices  that the management agreements with the affiliated physician groups will not be terminated or that any of the key members of a particular physician group will continue practicing with such group 
loss of revenue by the affiliated physician groups could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition 
the business of providing health care related services is intensely competitive 
the company is aware of a number of competitors specializing in the management of oncology practices  and several health care companies with established operating histories and significant resources are currently providing at least some management services to oncologists 
in addition  there are other companies with substantial resources that may decide to enter the oncology practice management business 
the company s revenues depend on the continued success of its affiliated physician groups 
the physician groups face competition from several sources  including sole practitioners  single and multi specialty groups  hospitals and managed care organizations 
see business competition 
reductions in third party reimbursement 
physician groups typically bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs eg  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
these third party payors are increasingly negotiating or legislating the prices charged for medical services  pharmaceuticals and other supplies  with the goal of lowering reimbursement and utilization rates 
for example  the proposed stark ii regulations would  if enacted  limit the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals expenses 
third party payors can also deny reimbursement for medical services  pharmaceuticals and other supplies if they determine that a treatment was not performed in accordance with treatment protocols established by such payors or for other reasons 
loss of revenue by the company s affiliated physician groups caused by cost containment efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that patients or enrollees covered by a contract require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated by the physician groups  the revenue to the affiliated physician groups derived from such contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of the services provided 
health care regulation 
the health care industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels 
the company believes its business and the practices of its affiliated physician groups are in material compliance with applicable law 
the relationships between the company and its affiliated physician groups  however  are unique and many aspects of these relationships have not been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s business or its affiliated physician groups by courts or by health care  tax  labor or other regulatory authorities would not result in determinations that could adversely affect the company s operations or that the health care regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the company s existing operations or potential for expansion 
there are currently several federal and state initiatives designed to amend regulations relating to the provision of health care services  the access to health care  the costs of health care and the manner in which health care providers are reimbursed for their services 
however  it is not possible to predict whether any such initiatives will be enacted as legislation or  if enacted  what their form  effective dates or impact on the company will be 
see business regulation 
risks inherent in provision of medical services 
the company s affiliated physician groups are involved in the delivery of health care services to the public and are exposed to the risk of professional liability claims 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in damage awards to the claimants in excess of the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses related to claims of this type can be expensive and varies widely from state to state 
the company and its affiliated physician groups maintain liability insurance in amounts and coverages believed to be usual and customary 
nevertheless  successful malpractice claims asserted against the physician groups or the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see legal proceedings 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends on the services of its executive officers for the management of the company and the implementation of its business strategy 
the company has obtained key man life insurance on its chief executive officer and its president 
nevertheless  the company could be materially adversely affected if the chief executive officer  president or other executive officers were unwilling or unable to continue in the company s employ 
see directors and executive officers of the registrant 
risk of applicability of insurance regulations 
the company and its affiliated groups may in the future enter into contracts with managed care organizations whereby the company and its affiliated groups would assume risk in connection with providing healthcare services under capitation arrangements 
if the company or its affiliated groups are considered to be in the business of insurance as a result of entering into such risk sharing arrangements  the company and such groups could become subject to a variety of regulatory and licensing requirements applicable to insurance companies which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price 
from time to time  there may be significant volatility in the market price for the common stock 
quarterly results of the company  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the health care industry  reimbursement trends or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
any shortfall in revenue  earnings or other financial results from levels expected by analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
in this regard the company neither endorses nor accepts any responsibility for the estimates or recommendations issued by stock research analysts from time to time 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
shareholder rights plan  anti takeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of the general corporation law of delaware the state in which the company is incorporated may make it difficult to change control of the company and to replace incumbent management 
for example  the company s certificate of incorporation permits the board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock or to establish one or more classes or series of preferred stock having the number of shares  designations  relative voting rights  dividend rates  liquidation and other rights  preferences and limitations that the board of directors can establish 
the company has also adopted a shareholder rights plan  which would materially inhibit the ability of another entity to acquire control of the company through a tender offer or otherwise without the approval of the company s board of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock

to fund this rapid growth and development  the company has satisfied its transaction and working capital needs through debt and equity financings and borrowings under a million syndicated revolving credit facility credit facility with first union national bank of north carolina first union  as agent for the various lenders 
in addition  as part of the credit facility  the company has recently obtained a million end loaded leasing facility  which will principally be used to finance the purchase of property and construction of integrated cancer centers

the company expects that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the company s cash requirements for the next months 
year issue the year issue ie  the ability of computer systems to accurately identify and process dates beginning with year and beyond affects virtually all companies and organizations 
recognizing the need to limit problems associated with year software failures  the company has developed plans to address this potential exposure 
key financial information and operational systems are being assessed  detailed plans have been developed and initial conversion efforts are underway 
the company recognizes that information systems are integral to its operations  and in and the company intends to make significant capital investments in developing an integrated clinical and financial information system throughout its network of affiliated physicians 
as a result of these investments  the company believes that the year issue will not pose significant internal problems for the company s business 
the company is also communicating with suppliers  financial institutions and  most importantly  third party payors such as managed care companies and governmental payors to determine their plans to limit problems associated with the year issue 
despite these efforts  the year issue is complex and may present unforeseen problems in the company s systems and from third parties with which the company deals  such as third party payors 
failure of the company s or third parties computer systems could materially and adversely impact the company s operations
