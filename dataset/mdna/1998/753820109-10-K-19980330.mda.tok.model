see the description of forward looking statements found in documents incorporated by reference 
effect of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on earnings during the past several years 
inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operations to offset increases in its operating costs 
federal law  enacted during  increased the hourly minimum wage by to on october  and by another to on september  the legislation  however  froze the wages of tipped employees at per hour if the difference is earned in tip income 
although the company experienced a slight increase in hourly labor costs during  the effect of the increase in minimum wage was significantly diluted due to the fact that the majority of the company s hourly employees are tipped and the company s non tipped employees have historically earned wages greater than the federal minimum 
as such  the company s increases in hourly labor cost were not proportionate to the increases in minimum wage rates 
the impact of minimum wage increases is expected to slightly increase hourly labor costs in year the company has implemented plans to address its potential exposure to so called year problems 
the company s key financial  informational and operational systems have been assessed and detailed plans have been developed to address system modifications required by december  the company expenses all costs associated with these system changes as the costs are incurred 
the financial impact of making the required system changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  the company is unable to estimate the costs that it may incur as a result of year problems suffered by the parties with which it deals  such as suppliers  and there can be no assurance that the company will successfully address the year problems present in its own systems
