the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the ratios and percentages provided below are calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
general as a one bank holding company for the greenwood bank  the company grew from approximately million in assets  million in loans  million in deposits  and million in shareholders equity at december   to approximately million in assets  million in loans  million in deposits  and million in shareholders equity at december  the opening of the clemson bank in june resulted in a year over year decrease of the company s earnings per share for the year ended december  the clemson bank became profitable in september  and at december   the company had approximately million in assets  million in loans  million in deposits  and million in shareholders equity 
due to the acquisitions of the new banks and the carolina first branches and net proceeds from the offering  the company has grown to million in assets  million in loans  million in deposits  and million in shareholders equity at december  the start up expenditures associated with the new banks  including the time and expense required to attract customers  deposits  and earning assets  and an increase in the number of outstanding shares of common stock from the offering  have resulted in a year over year decrease in the company s earnings per share 
management has emphasized maintaining strong asset quality through a credit underwriting and review system which includes both bank level and centralized controls 
over the five year period ended december   the company had an average net charge off ratio of 
at december   nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans was 
during  the company made the decision to acquire and capitalize the three new banks 
to capitalize the new banks  the company sold  shares of its common stock in the offering  resulting in net proceeds of million 
of the net proceeds  the company used million to capitalize the barnwell bank  million to capitalize the belton bank  and million to capitalize the newberry bank 
in accordance with the agreements with the organizers of the new banks and subject to the new banks being opened  the company agreed to include organizational and preopening costs in the initial capitalization of the new banks 
the goodwill associated with the acquisitions totaled  and is being amortized over a five year period on a straight line basis 
on april   the barnwell bank acquired net loans including accrued interest receivable of approximately and premises and equipment of approximately million and assumed deposits including accrued interest payable of approximately million of five branches located in aiken  barnwell and orangeburg counties  south carolina from carolina first bank the carolina first branches 
in connection with the purchase of the carolina first branches  the barnwell bank paid a premium of million which is being amortized over a fifteen year period on a straight line basis 
during  the company experienced dilution of its return on equity and earnings per share due to the increased number of shares of common stock from the offering  expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and opening of the new banks  and losses incurred by the belton bank and the newberry bank 
tangible book value per share was also negatively affected by the intangibles associated with the acquisition of the carolina first branches and the new banks 
the company believes that the dilution of earnings per share  return on equity  and tangible book value per share will be outweighed by the long term benefits and shareholder value the company expects to derive from the purchase of the new banks and the acquisition of the carolina first branches 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve these goals 
on february   the clemson bank and the belton bank entered into purchase and assumption agreements with carolina first bank whereby the belton bank will acquire certain assets and assume deposits of two branch offices of carolina first bank in anderson county  south carolina and the clemson bank will acquire certain assets and assume deposits of a branch office in calhoun falls  south carolina 
the belton bank and the clemson bank will each pay a premium to carolina first bank equal to of the deposits other than certificates of deposit greater than or equal to  assumed on the date of closing 
the company anticipates that the total deposits will be approximately million and the loans will be approximately million based on the unaudited balances at december  results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  net interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net interest income was due primarily to an increase in average earning assets

the provision for loan losses was  in compared to  in the increase in the provision was primarily the result of the growth in the loan portfolio from the acquisition and opening of the new banks and the banks efforts to maintain their respective allowances for loan losses at levels sufficient to cover known and inherent losses in their loan portfolios 
noninterest income increased  or  to million in from million in  primarily attributable to increased service charges on deposit accounts and increased fees from mortgage loan originations 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was attributable to the increase in the number of deposit accounts from acquisitions during the year and the growth of the new banks

the company s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in as compared to and in the decrease in the net interest spread and the net interest margin was primarily the result of the growth in the volume of investment securities as a percentage of average earning assets in order to improve liquidity and lower the loans to assets ratio

the largest component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents the company s net interest margin 
average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to the company s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated

all loans and deposits are domestic

analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following tables set forth the effect which the varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income from to and to analysis of changes in net interest income year ended december  compared with compared with variance due to variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total earning assets loans     securities  taxable   securities  nontaxable nonmarketable equity securities funds sold and other total interest income     interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts savings and market rate investments certificates and other time deposits   total interest bearing deposits    other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances total interest expense     net interest income   volume rate changes have been allocated to each category based on the percentage of the total change 
interest sensitivity 
the company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique employed by the company is the measurement of the company s interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in this same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis after one after three greater than within through through one year one three twelve within or non december  dollars in thousands month months months one year sensitive total assets earning assets loans       securities     funds sold and other total earning assets       liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits       total interest bearing deposits       other short term borrowings    federal home loan bank advances      total interest bearing liabilities       period gap      cumulative gap      ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements which give the company the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
the company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive 
the company is liability sensitive over the one month  three month  and one year time frames 
however  the company s gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  management believes a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of the company s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
the company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a quarterly basis  each bank s board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for that bank s allowance for loan losses based upon management s recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both the company and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on the company s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s allowance for loan losses is based upon judgements and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  management monitors the overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  charge offs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the company s monitoring and analysis system are also reviewed periodically by the banking regulators and the company s independent auditors 
based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
the company does not allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans but evaluates the adequacy on an overall portfolio basis utilizing a risk grading system 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses and the composition of charge offs and recoveries for each of the last five years 
allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period  net of unearned income      average loans outstanding  net of unearned income      balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period allowance for loan losses from acquisitions loan losses commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer total loan losses recoveries of previous loan losses commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net loan losses provision for loan losses balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period  allowance for loan losses to period end loans net charge offs to average loans nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured or impaired loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end loans and foreclosed property accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if the company s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets increased  to  at december   from  at december  this increase was primarily due to the foreclosure on a piece of other real estate valued at  and one customer owing  who was placed in nonaccrual status in december nonperforming assets were of total loans and foreclosed property at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  potential problem loans 
at december   through their internal review mechanisms  the banks had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
the largest component of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts  which totaled  in  a increase over the level of  the increase in service charges and other noninterest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the customer base due to the acquisitions of the new banks and the carolina first branches 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees in order to staff the new banks and the trust services company 
the acquisitions of the new banks and the carolina first branches also resulted in increases in all other categories of noninterest expense 
the company is amortizing the intangible assets associated with the acquisitions over periods ranging from five to fifteen years 
during  the company recorded amortization expense of  compared to  in the factors above resulted in increases in net occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  and other operating expenses 
the company s efficiency ratio  which is noninterest expense as a percentage of the total of net interest income plus noninterest income  net of gains and losses on the sale of assets  was in compared to in and in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal components of noninterest income noninterest income year ended december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts residential mortgage origination fees securities gains losses fees from sales of mutual funds other total noninterest income   noninterest expense

loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans were million compared to million at december  the increase in loans during was primarily due to the new markets created by the acquisition of the new banks and the purchase of approximately million in loans from the acquisition of the carolina first branches by the barnwell bank 
the banks have also actively sought opportunities to participate in loans originated by other financial institutions 
the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio by category at the dates indicated and highlights the company s general emphasis on mortgage lending 
composition of loan portfolio december  percent percent percent percent percent dollars in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      mortgage residential      mortgage nonresidential      consumer      other total loans      allowance for loan losses  net loans      the principal component of the company s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at december   this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in the company s market areas to obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
residential mortgage loans  which is the largest category of the company s loans  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase in real estate lending was attributable to the new markets in the local communities of the new banks  the continued demand for residential and commercial real estate loans in the greenwood market  and loan growth at the clemson bank 
the banks have been able to compete favorably for residential mortgage loans with other financial institutions by offering fixed rate products having three and five year call provisions 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the company  particularly the new banks  actively seeking participation loans from unrelated financial institutions 
management believes that these participation loans do not have more credit risk than other loans and provide a greater return than investment securities 
consumer loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the growth in consumer loans is primarily attributable to overall growth in the company s loan portfolio due to new markets created by the acquisitions 
the barnwell bank and the belton bank are in more rural areas  which typically have more consumer loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio 
the company s loan portfolio reflects the diversity of its markets 
the home office and branch offices of the greenwood bank are located in greenwood county  south carolina 
the economy of greenwood contains elements of medium and light manufacturing  higher education  regional healthcare  and distribution facilities 
the clemson bank moved into its permanent facility in clemson  south carolina during due to its proximity to a major interstate highway and clemson university  a state supported university  management expects the area to remain stable with continued growth 
the belton bank and the barnwell bank are in more rural areas and will have a higher concentration of consumer loans with fewer opportunities for commercial lending 
the newberry bank is located in newberry county  south carolina and is in close proximity to an interstate highway 
the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
the company does not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of liquidity for the company 
the following table sets forth the company s loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates over one year one year through over five december  dollars in thousands or less five years years total commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate     consumer and other     loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates  floating interest rates  the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown on the above table 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of the company s total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  compared to million in and million in at december   the total securities portfolio was million 
securities designated as available for sale totaled million and were recorded at estimated fair market value  and securities designated as held to maturity totaled  and were recorded at amortized cost 
the securities portfolio also includes nonmarketable equity securities totaling million which are carried at cost because they are not readily marketable or have no quoted market value 
these include investment in federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock and the stock of four unrelated financial institutions 
the increase in the portfolio during was primarily due to the investment of proceeds from the offering and from the acquisition of the carolina first branches in debt securities 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities held by the company at the dates indicated

the yield on state and political subdivisions is presented on a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 
other attributes of the securities portfolio  including yields and maturities  are discussed above in net interest income interest sensitivity 
short term investments 
short term investments  which consist primarily of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks  averaged million in  compared to million in and million in at december   short term investments totaled  these funds are a source of the banks liquidity 
federal funds are generally invested in an earning capacity on an overnight basis 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million in  from million in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million in  from million in these increases resulted from increases in most categories of interest bearing liabilities  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the new banks and the approximately million of deposits transferred upon the acquisition of the carolina first branches 
deposits 
average total deposits increased million  or  to million during  from million during at december   total deposits were million compared to million a year earlier  an increase of 
the following table sets forth the deposits of the company by category at the dates indicated 
deposits december percent percent percent percent percent dollars in thousands amount of deposits amount of deposits amount of deposits amount of deposits amount of deposits demand deposit accounts      now accounts      money market accounts      savings accounts      time deposits less than       time deposits of  or over      total deposits      core deposits  which exclude certificates of deposit of  or more  provide a relatively stable funding source for the company s loan portfolio and other earning assets 
the company s core deposits increased million in due to the acquisitions by the company 
deposits  and particularly core deposits  have historically been the company s primary source of funding and have enabled the company to meet successfully both its short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be the company s primary source of funding in the future 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of  and the ratio averaged during the maturity distribution of the company s time deposits over  at december   is set forth in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more after three after six within through through after three six twelve twelve months months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more      approximately of the company s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months and had maturities within six months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  the company does not solicit brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist primarily of short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased from correspondent banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and advances from the federal home loan bank 
average short term borrowings were million in  an increase of  from average federal home loan bank advances during were million compared to million during  an increase of million 
advances from the federal home loan bank are collateralized by million of debt securities of us government agencies  one to four family residential mortgage loans  and the company s investment in federal home loan bank stock 
at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
although management expects to continue using short term borrowing and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be the company s primary funding source 
long term debt 
of the million advances from the federal home loan bank outstanding at december   million will mature after one year 
capital the federal reserve board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off balance sheet exposures  adjusted for risk weights ranging from to 
under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
the federal reserve guidelines contain an exemption from the capital requirements for bank holding companies with less than million in consolidated assets 
prior to the offering  the company had less than million in assets and  consequently  was not subject to these rules 
following the offering and the acquisition of the carolina first branches  however  the company had assets in excess of million  and the federal reserve s requirements applied to the company 
tier i capital of the company consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
the company s tier capital consists of general reserve for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier i and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier i and for total risk based capital 
the holding company and banking subsidiaries are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets as defined  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to basis points above the minimum 
the company exceeded the federal reserve s fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december   and  as set forth in the following table 
analysis of capital december  dollars in thousands tier i capital    tier capital  total qualifying capital    risk adjusted total assets including off balance sheet exposures    tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio each of the banks is required to maintain risk based and leverage ratios similar to those required for the company 
each of the banks exceeded these regulatory capital ratios at december   as set forth in the following table 
bank capital ratios tier total risk risk tier december  based based leverage the greenwood bank the clemson bank the barnwell bank the belton bank the newberry bank the banks are expected to maintain capital ratios that exceed their regulatory minimum requirements 
the company has verbally committed to the state commissioner of banking to maintain the percentage of tier capital as defined by the commissioner to total assets at the new banks at a minimum of the clemson bank and the belton bank have entered into agreements with carolina first bank to acquire three of its branch offices 
the purchase of the branches and the intangible assets resulting from the purchase will lower the capital ratios of the two banks 
the company will be required to infuse additional capital into the belton bank 
see liquidity management and capital resources for additional information 
liquidity management and capital resources liquidity management involves monitoring the company s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
net proceeds from the offering and cash received upon the acquisition of the carolina first branches improved the overall liquidity of the company 
the funds were primarily invested in securities which the company has designated as available for sale 
as a result  the company s loans to assets ratio and loans to funds ratio decreased 
the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank increased approximately million from the december  balance of approximately million 
management expects to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
additionally  the company has approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases 
the company also has approximately million of securities available for sale as a source of liquidity 
the company depends on dividends from the banks as its primary source of liquidity 
the ability of the banks to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions which may  but are not expected to  have a material impact on the liquidity available to the company 
generally  banks are not allowed to pay dividends unless the retained earnings are in a positive position 
accordingly  management does not expect the new banks to be able to pay cash in the form of dividends to its parent company in the near future 
the company does not plan to pay cash dividends for the near term 
the company has paid stock dividends in september  april  august  and may and may do so in the future 
the net proceeds of the offering were adequate for the initial capitalization of each new bank and for capital injections at the barnwell bank and the greenwood bank to comply with capital requirements of the state board resulting from the growth of the banks 
the state board could require the company to increase the capitalization of any of the banks 
in such event  the company would likely fund the increased capitalization through the proceeds remaining from the offering  from dividends from the banks to the extent available  through loans from the company s banking subsidiaries subject to regulatory limits and regulatory approval or through loans from third parties subject to obtaining regulatory approval 
the greenwood bank has entered into a purchase and assumption agreement dated november  with the palmetto bank to sell certain assets  specifically overdraft protection loans  and assign and transfer the deposits of its branch in ninety six  south carolina 
the company anticipates that the sale of the branch will occur during the second quarter of in order to pay the palmetto bank for the net liabilities assumed  the greenwood bank will sell investments from its portfolio of securities available for sale 
as of december   the overdraft protection loans of the ninety six branch were  and the deposits were million 
the volume of loans and deposits at december  may change considerably prior to the closing date 
on february   the clemson bank and the belton bank each entered into purchase and assumption agreements to acquire certain assets and assume deposits of three branch offices of carolina first bank 
the clemson bank will assume approximately million based on december  levels  unaudited of deposits of the calhoun falls  south carolina branch 
the belton bank will assume approximately million based on december  levels  unaudited of deposits of two branches located in anderson county  south carolina 
the clemson bank s current capital structure will support the acquisition with no capital infusion by the company 
in contrast  the company will have to inject capital in the belton bank in order for the belton bank to remain well capitalized and to meet the minimum capital requirements of the state board 
although the amount of additional capital needed for the belton bank can not be determined until the closing date  the company expects the amount to range from to million 
the company expects to fund the additional capitalization through a combination of liquid assets of the parent  cash dividends from the greenwood bank  borrowings from the banking subsidiaries  and loans from a third party 
the amount of each funding source has not yet been determined 
accounting rule changes earnings per share 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  earnings per share  effective for years ending after december  sfas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share and makes them comparable to international earning per share standards 
it also requires the dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic earnings per share computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted earnings per share computation 
basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period excluding the effects of any dilutive potential common shares 
diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued 
the dilutive effect of options outstanding under the company s stock option plan is reflected in diluted earnings per share by the application of the treasury stock method 
sfas became effective for the company as of december  as required by sfas  all prior period earnings per share data presented has been restated to conform with the provisions of the statement 
comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb released sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
sfas requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources and excludes investments by owners and distributions to owners 
comprehensive income consists of two components  net income and other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income includes  among other things  the change in the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
industry developments in february   the supreme court ruled that federal credit unions must limit its membership to employees of the company that sponsors it 
banking leaders throughout the country have argued that credit unions have an unfair competitive advantage because they do not pay income taxes and are not subject to the same level of regulatory oversight 
the supreme court ruling applies only to federal credit unions 
state chartered credit unions were not directly affected by the ruling 
the lower courts will determine whether current members who are not employed by the credit union sponsor will be forced to close their accounts 
management does not expect the ruling to have an immediate affect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the effects on future periods has not yet been determined 
the year during  the company commenced a year date conversion project to address all necessary code changes  testing and implementation 
failure to address the issue could result in computer applications which fail or create erroneous results by or at the year bank regulators have established minimum guidelines for banks in addressing the year issue 
the regulators are monitoring the progress of banks in complying with these guidelines and have the option of taking regulatory action for banks which have not made satisfactory progress in addressing the year issue 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  and test the systems for the year compliance 
the company has contacted its primary processing vendors  and the vendors have developed plans to address processing of transactions in the year management has not yet assessed the year compliance expense but does not expect it to have a material effect on the company s earnings 
maintenance or modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized over the software s useful life
