item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k particularly this item contains statements that are considered forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of as discussed in item business under forward looking statements and risk factors  actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by those forward looking statements 
general in  the company went through a major transformation as a result of the acquisition discussed in item business above 
legally  xplor corporation acquired the assets of new venus 
however  accounting principles require that this transaction be treated as a reverse acquisition of the company by new venus 
after the transaction  the company s name was changed from xplor corporation to venus exploration  inc under the reverse acquisition accounting principles  the results of operations and financial information for prior years shown in this report are those of the predecessor venus entities  not xplor corporation 
moreover  operational data shown herein for periods prior to may   eg  production information  reflect the operations of new venus and its predecessors 
accordingly  comparison of information in this report with prior xplor corporation corporate reports previously filed under the security exchange act of is not an appropriate performance measure 
the oil and gas reserves added by the acquisition  plus the completion of new wells drilled in the company s drilling program  increased venus proved oil and gas reserves  net of production and revisions of previous estimates  by over from bcfe on december   to bcfe on december  in  the production obtained and the revisions of previous estimates of reserves that were incurred together resulted in a reduction of reserves of approximately bcfe  so the gross increase in proved reserves was bcfe 
of that gross increase in proved reserves   or bcfe  is attributable to the acquisition transaction  and  or bcfe  to the company s exploration and development program 
of the bcfe proved reserves increase from the drilling and exploration programs in   or bcfe  was comprised of proved undeveloped reserves in the constitution field  jefferson county  texas  and  or bcfe  was comprised of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves in the allen field  seminole county  oklahoma 
the balance of the company s proved reserve growth was through extensions  discoveries and additions in other fields  including the shanghai field  wharton county  texas  and the vidor south field  orange county  texas 
the company s drilling program resulted in the drilling of wells during and the first quarter of five of the wells drilled were exploratory wells  and were development wells 
twelve of the wells have been completed as oil and gas wells  one well was completed as a non commercial oil well  and as of march   two wells were in the process of being completed 
six of the wells drilled by the drilling program were producing revenue in december  as of the end of march  are expected to be producing revenue 
management s business plan for its program provides for capital expenditures of approximately million for exploration and development drilling and land and d seismic acquisition 
approximately million of this amount million is expected to be financed under the stratum facility described below  leaving approximately million to be financed by other sources of corporate finance as discussed below 
the number of wells proposed to be drilled under management s program is exploratory and development wells 
the cost of d seismic acquisition included in the plan is estimated at  the company may elect to reduce its interests  through sales  farmouts or other transactions  in certain wells or seismic projects or to include those wells or projects in a joint venture with industry participants  in which event the company s capital investment and upside potential would be lower 
the actual timing of the drilling of the wells is dependent upon may unpredictable factors  and in all likelihood the drilling program will not be completed until the number of wells that were drilled in and that are currently being operated required a large increase in venus s operations  accounting and administrative staff 
however  venus believes that the current staff levels can manage the new wells in the drilling program at a lower marginal cost than experienced in the company s general and administrative expense increased significantly from to this increase is due primarily to two factors  ie  significantly expanded exploration activities and various corporate restructurings during and the corporate restructurings included i the incorporation of a united kingdom public limited company  ii the repatriation of the united kingdom company  and iii the acquisition 
all contributed to the significant increase in both and of the company s general and administrative costs 
venus uses the successful efforts method of accounting of its oil and gas activities 
it capitalizes the costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and to equip exploratory wells that result in proved reserves  and to drill and to equip development wells 
it expenses the costs to drill exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves  costs of geological  geophysical and seismic data and analysis  and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties 
capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties  after considering estimated abandonment costs and estimated salvage values  are depreciated and depleted using the unit of production method 
unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically reviewed for impairment of value  and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance 
the acquisition and the corporate restructuring in affected the reported financial results in various ways 
the historical financial statements of the company are that of a predecessor entity for all of and the first six months of on july   that predecessor entity transferred most but not all of its interest in the oil and gas properties to another predecessor entity of the company 
comparisons of revenues and expenses between and are affected by the inclusion in the first half of of the revenues and expenses attributable to oil and gas properties and other assets and liabilities that were  for accounting purposes  deemed distributed on july  likewise  comparisons of results with results are affected because contains months of activity attributable to the assets and liabilities deemed distributed as of july   while contains six months of activity 
results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  the company experienced a net loss of million for versus a net loss of million for the company reported impairment losses in and of million and million  respectively 
general and administrative cost increased by  or over 
oil and gas production was mmcfe in compared to mmcfe in  an increase of over 
of the mmcfe increase  approximately mmcfe was due to successful drilling activities 
the remainder  mmcfe  was due to production from the properties acquired from xplor and lomak 
average oil prices declined from per barrel in to in  a decrease 
average natural gas prices declined from per mcf to  a decrease 
despite the decrease in average product prices  oil and gas revenue of million for increased by million over revenue of million  primarily due to successful drilling and the acquisition 
oil and gas production costs in were  per mcfe compared with  in per mcfe 
this decrease is due mainly to the lower operating cost of new properties acquired through successful drilling and the acquisition 
the production or lifting cost as a percentage of oil and gas sales decreased to  compared with in during the company booked impairment expense of million as compared to the million recorded in the impairment expenses for both and relate primarily to the cost  initially capitalized  of acquiring and drilling exploratory and development wells that were completed but that failed to establish enough reserve value to justify their carrying value 
in such cases an impairment is recognized to reduce the capitalized cost to the estimated fair market value of each well  which valuation is on a field by field basis 
costs of exploratory wells that are not completed  but are plugged and abandoned  are charged directly to dry hole expense 
the exploration expense  including geological  geophysical and seismic data acquisition and analysis and dry hole expenses  was  in  compared to  in the increase is due mainly to the company s drilling of one exploratory well dry hole during the year and increased activity in exploration joint ventures operated by the company that resulted in an increase in geological and geophysical costs 
during  general and administrative expense of  increased  from  in this increase was primarily due to the significant increase in exploration activity and the acquisition 
the exploration activities led to the creation of new employee positions and the increased use of third party engineering services and other professional consultants 
the amount also includes  of non cash compensation expense related to stock options granted to directors and costs in connection with the corporate restructuring 
the company s interest income of  increased by  over due primarily to interest received from the investment of cash acquired in the acquisition 
interest expense was  in  compared to  in the  increase is primarily due to increased borrowings by venus development  inc approximately  of the interest expense reported by venus development  inc  represents amortization of deferred financing cost  not a current or future cash expense 
the average balances of interest bearing debt was  in  compared to  in year ended december   compared with year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million for versus a net loss of million for the company reported impairment expense of million in and none in general and administrative expense increased by million 
oil and gas production was mmcfe in compared to mmcfe in  a decrease of over 
accordingly  revenues decreased from million for to million in  a decrease of million  or 
production in and related revenues include revenue from properties that were sold in early as well as from properties that were deemed distributed to shareholders effective july  as a result  these properties reported twelve months production and related revenue in but only six months in the decline in revenue was lower than the decline in production because of the increase in average prices 
average oil prices increased from per barrel in to in  a increase 
average natural gas prices increased from per mcf in to in  a increase 
the depletion rate of as a percentage of sales is comparable to s rate of 
oil and gas production costs in were  per mcfe compared with  in per mcfe 
the decrease in total cost was due to the properties retained by the predecessor entity and properties sold in early the costs for include months of operations for these wells  while reflects operations for six months for the wells retained by the predecessor entity and one to three months operations for the properties sold during the first half of production cost per mcfe increased due mainly to costs incurred on the company s oklahoma wells to improve production and operating efficiencies 
the lifting cost of oil and gas sales of relative to sales decreased by from the prior year s cost of relative to sales 
increased average product prices contributed to the decrease in cost as a percent of sales 
exploration including geological  geophysical and seismic data and analysis and dry hole costs expense was  in compared to  in  a  decrease from the amount for includes dry hole costs of  there was no dry hole expense in the most significant component of the balance of the remaining  decrease is the result of the company selling part of its participation in an exploration joint venture to a new participant 
this reduced the company s share of the allocated geological  geophysical  seismic and other venture expenses 
during  general and administrative expense of  increased  from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in overhead to support increased exploration activity and overhead costs related to corporate restructuring that resulted in an increased use of consultants  such as attorneys  accountants and engineers 
the general and administrative expense for also includes  of compensation expense related to stock options granted new non employee directors 
the company s interest income of  decreased by  over because for twelve months in  but only six months in  the company had notes receivable from certain shareholders 
these notes  which totaled  at december   were retained by the predecessor entity and for accounting purposes treated as distributed to shareholders on july  as a result  interest income for reflects six months of interest from these notes while reflects twelve months 
interest and other expenses were  in  compared to  in the  decrease was primarily due to a  worthless inventory write down 
interest expense in was higher than in the average balances of interest bearing debt were  in  compared to  in the interest bearing debt outstanding in consisted of bank debt that was subject to a much higher interest rate than the interest bearing debt outstanding during  which consisted of notes payable to former shareholders 
accounting policies in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components 
this statement requires a separate statement to report the components of comprehensive income for each period reported 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management believes that the company currently does not have items that would require presentation in a separate statement of comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which establishes standards and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services and major customers 
this statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on its financial statement disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  compared with working capital of  at december   a decrease of  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december   was 
to compared with to at december  net cash used in operating activities during was  whereas  was used during cash and equivalents decreased by  principally due to capital expenditures related to exploration and development and the cost of administrative services required to support the increased exploration activities and corporate restructurings 
the increase of  in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the timing of revenue receipts and joint interest receivables 
the increase in current liabilities of  is attributable to the increased level of drilling conducted by the company in and higher revenue payables to nonoperating interest owners as a result of the increasing number of operated properties 
capital resources to fund its business activities  venus had previously relied on bank financing  cash flow from operations  sales of properties and joint ventures with industry participants 
in  the decision was made to sell equity interests and to use limited recourse financing under a credit facility with stratum group energy partners  lp 
in  a more conventional line of credit facility was set up with wells fargo bank texas  na in the future  venus intends to finance its drilling plans and other operations with cash flow from operations  borrowings from the two credit facilities  sales of non strategic properties  and public and private equity sales 
the prices paid to venus and other producers in the first three months of have been considerably below the average price received in that diminished revenue could have a material effect on the number of wells drilled by the company in cash flow from existing properties will not fund management s drilling plan  therefore  the number of wells drilled by the company will depend on a number of external factors  the most important of which is the availability to the company of debt and equity capital in public and private capital markets 
in addition  if venus is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its debt  it may be required to refinance all or some of its debt  to sell certain assets or to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
there is no assurance that any such additional funding will be available 
any major property acquisitions are also dependent upon receiving adequate financing to fund the purchase  therefore  any such transaction will be subject to the same factors 
while venus regularly evaluates and discusses possible acquisitions  it has no present agreements or commitments with regard to any specific such acquisition 
any acquisition outside of current exploration and development programs would require additional financing and would be dependent upon financing options available at that time 
venus has been successful in the highly capital intensive oil and gas exploration business 
the capital resources and liquidity needed to run the business over the last several years have been provided in large part from two main sources cash sales of properties that were the result of venus s past exploratory successes and debt and equity financing 
there is no assurance that such sources of capital will be available in the future 
the successes of and provide a cash flow stream that is dependent upon the various factors that generally affect the domestic oil and gas markets  eg  price  government regulation and normal oil and gas operational events 
of course  the current trend of lower oil and gas prices has a negative effect on cash flow from current production  the lines of credit that are supported by reserve value  and the availability of the new capital resources needed to explore and develop the extensive portfolio of projects and prospects that venus has under study 
increases in the lines of credit are directly dependent upon continued successes in drilling productive wells and the prices paid for oil and natural gas production at any given time 
indirectly  those continued successes would help in any efforts to raise additional capital resources 
stratum facility effective october   venus entered into a credit facility the stratum facility with stratum energy group partners  lp stratum 
the stratum facility provides a term loan with a maximum limit of million 
the line of credit limit varies with the value of the borrowing base  which is based on the value of the properties subject to the underlying deed of trust 
the lender s only recourse is against venus development  inc venus development  a wholly owned subsidiary of venus exploration  inc  and the properties securing the stratum facility 
the final drawdown can be made no later than october   and its maximum term is years 
the right of venus development to draw on the line of credit is subject to numerous collateral tests 
the interest rate charged on outstanding advances is floating prime plus 
prepayment is not allowed until the earlier of i when the full line has been drawn down  or ii october  as a part of the stratum facility  stratum was granted an overriding royalty interest equal to of venus development s net revenue interest in the properties subject to the stratum deed of trust 
stratum can convert its overriding royalty interest into venus common stock at share  with the present value of the overriding royalty interest being determined based on a discount rate 
stratum also has certain restricted warrants that become exercisable after venus conducts its next public offering  and the price per share pursuant to those warrants is of the public offering price 
the conversion rights and the warrants are exercisable only against a pool of venus exploration common stock the conversion share pool that are owned by the shareholders of the former venus entity that was a party to the acquisition 
the conversion share pool contains  shares of venus exploration common stock  and those shares are held in an escrow account maintained by the frost national bank 
in the event that stratum exercises its conversion rights or warrants  no new shares of the company s common stock would be issued to satisfy those rights or warrants 
hedging activities on certain properties  venus uses commodity derivative contracts to protect and to ensure cash flow levels 
those properties currently are limited to those that are owned by venus development and that are subject to the financing facility provided by stratum 
the stratum facility requires that those hedges be used  in part  because it is arranged in such a way that the lender has no recourse against the assets of the parent that are not owned by venus development 
on december   venus development entered into a financial swap  whereby the counterparty agrees to pay venus development the difference between the floating price and the fixed price for certain volumes of production in future months commencing with january production if the floating price falls below the negotiated fixed price of per mmbtu for natural gas or per barrel for oil  respectively 
should the floating price exceed the fixed price for natural gas or oil  the company is required to remit the difference to the counterparty 
as of december   quantities hedged are  mmbtu s of natural gas and  barrels of oil 
this financial swap agreement expires december  as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s swap positions was a net receivable of approximately  based upon an estimate of what the company would receive if the contracts were liquidated 
the net effect of venus s commodity derivative contracts reduced oil and gas revenues by  and  in the years ended december  and there were no hedges in place in wells fargo facility effective december   the company entered into a revolving line of credit facility the wells fargo facility with wells fargo bank texas  na wells fargo 
the wells fargo facility is a million revolving line of credit subject to a borrowing base supported by the value of the mortgaged oil and gas reserves on which wells fargo has a first lien 
those reserves include substantially all of the assets of the company other than those that are owned by venus development 
draws may be made as either prime rate advances or libor advances 
the borrowing base as of march   was  of which  had been drawn at that date 
the facility terminates on june  prime rate advances accrue interest at the floating prime rate quoted by wells fargo 
libor advances accrue interest at libor plus 
the libor rate also is increased to cover any bank reserve costs  and if there is any increase in the administration costs of the libor advances due to changes in the law  wells fargo can assess additional charges to cover those additional costs 
the advances received by venus as of december   and as of march   were prime rate advances  and the interest rate was  per annum on both such dates 
fees payable by venus under the agreement include a borrowing base determination fee  for each regular redetermination  a facility fee of any increase in the borrowing base  and a commitment fee a quarterly payment based on a charge of per annum on the average unused borrowing base for each day during the preceding calendar quarter 
negative restrictions imposed upon venus by the wells fargo agreement include venus s agreement to not declare a dividend  not enter into any hedging agreement covering more than of venus s projected monthly production or for periods beyond the current calendar year  not amend the stratum agreements  not advance venus development more than  per year  not allow gas balancing  take or pay contracts or other similar situations to exist to the extent that venus would not be entitled to receive the full value of delivered production  not merge or consolidate with anyone else unless venus is the survivor  not change its control or management  and not allow other liens to be placed on venus s properties 
in order to use the wells fargo facility  venus must maintain wells fargo s first lien on the properties subject to the deed of trust and other usual covenants 
venus must maintain a ratio of a the sum of all of its current assets and the unused amount of the borrowing base  to b all of its accounts payable and other current liabilities 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth requirement 
the company obtained a waiver from the lender as of december  which included a reduction in tangible net worth requirement to  however  because of uncertainty regarding the company s ability to remain in compliance with this covenant through the first quarter of  the outstanding balance has been classified as a current liability in the december  financial statements 
inflation although many of venus s expenses and items of income may be affected by inflation  inflationary costs have not had a significant effect on its results of operations 
however  the tightness in the drilling rig market is a concern and may lead to inflationary effects in the near future 
impact of year concern over the year arises because many computer microprocessors have been designed  and application software has been written  using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of venus s microprocessors or application software that are time sensitive may recognize a date of as the year  rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  eg  a temporary inability to operate machinery  to process transactions  to send invoices  or to otherwise engage in normal business activities 
venus has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify any such problems  and it has not identified any problems that will require the expenditure of material amounts to address 
venus has developed a plan to conduct tests throughout to evaluate the situation 
the company has received written representations from the accounting firms that manage the company s accounting and payroll about any year risks  and based on those representations venus believes that there is no problem with those firms computer systems in that regard 
venus has business relations with many other companies  including various purchasers of production 
it has not checked with those entities  but it believes that even if those entities have any year problems  those problems will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business or finances 
however  until that time  venus cannot give any assurances regarding the year effect
