the company has experienced an operating loss for each of the last three years and expects to continue to incur operating losses through at least cvd s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
quarterly operating results depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with expanding the company s operations  the conduct of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products  the mix between domestic and export sales  variations in foreign exchange rates  changes in third party payors reimbursement policies and healthcare reform 
the company does not operate with a significant backlog of customer orders  and therefore revenues in any quarter are significantly dependent on orders received within that quarter 
in addition  the company cannot predict ordering rates by distributors  some of whom place infrequent stocking orders 
the company s expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to adjust in response to fluctuation revenues 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from the sale of its equity securities  advances from endosonics  licensing its technologies and through international product distribution agreements

on december   cvd had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
the company expects to incur substantial costs related to  among other things  clinical testing  product development  marketing and sales expenses  and to utilize increased levels of working capital to finance its accounts receivable and inventories  prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through june  cvd s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including its research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the regulatory approval process  the costs involved in intellectual property rights enforcement or litigation  competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  and the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties 
the company may need to raise funds through additional financings  including private or public equity offerings and collaborative arrangements with existing or new corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that funds will be raised on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to grant rights to certain technologies or products that the company would not otherwise grant

dependence upon new products  rapid technological change  risk of obsolescence 
the medical device industry generally  and the interventional catheter market in particular  are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions 
as a result  the useful lives of both the technology and products for the treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases are limited  in some instances to as little as twelve months 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop  manufacture and introduce new products that address the needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products that achieve market acceptance or that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s existing products will not be rendered obsolete as a result of technological developments or that the products that the company has under development will not be rendered obsolete prior to the introduction of such products 
see item business products 
limited sales to date  uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s catheters and stents are used in conjunction with angioplasty and other intravascular procedures such as vascular stenting and drug delivery 
although the company has received regulatory clearance for a total of product models  only of such product models have been marketed 
of those products which have been marketed  many have been marketed only in limited quantities or in certain markets  or are allowed to be marketed only in certain countries 
in addition  while interventional catheters are widely used technologies  the company s catheter designs are relatively new 
the commercial success of the company s products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community as useful  cost effective components of interventional cardiovascular and peripheral vascular procedures  including the acceptance by the medical community of stents and the availability and acceptance of therapeutic drugs for use in interventional procedures 
the company currently relies upon relationships with certain prominent doctors and researchers in the medical community to promote the uses and acceptance of its approved products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or establish additional relationships in the future 
the erosion or loss of any such relationship could detrimentally affect the market acceptance of the company s products 
failure of the company s products to achieve such market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
cvd s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company has experienced an operating loss for each of the last six years 
quarterly operating results will depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with expanding the company s operations  the conduct of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products  the mix between domestic and export sales  variations in foreign exchange rates  changes in third party payors reimbursement policies and healthcare reform

reliance on patents and proprietary technology  risk of patent infringement 
while the company owns certain issued and allowed us patents and has additional us and foreign patent applications pending  there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications will issue as patents or that any issued patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
the interventional cardiovascular and peripheral vascular markets in general and the market for balloon angioplasty catheters and coronary stents including the types of catheters and stents offered by cvd in particular has been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company s products do not infringe such patents or rights 
during  the company was sued for trademark infringement regarding the company s use of the product name lynx in connection with one of the company s balloon angioplasty catheter product lines 
cvd paid no monetary damages but agreed to a consent judgment which prohibits the company from using this name in the united states 
in the event that any parties assert claims against the company for patent infringement and such patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from utilizing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the owners of any such patents or redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be so on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
in addition  foreign intellectual property laws may not provide protection commensurate with that provided by us intellectual property laws  and there can be no assurance that foreign intellectual property laws will adequately protect the company s intellectual property rights abroad 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology and enters into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with its employees  consultants and advisors 
there can be no assurance that the confidentiality of such trade secrets or proprietary information will be maintained by employees  consultants  advisors or others  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in such a manner that the company has no practical recourse 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to enforce patents issued to the company or to protect trade secrets  and there can be no assurance that any such litigation would be successful 
any litigation could result in substantial costs to  and diversion of resources by  the company and its officers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

significant competition 
competition in the market for devices used in the treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and is expected to increase 
the interventional cardiology market is characterized by rapid technological innovation and change  and the company s products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
the company s catheters  coronary stents and other products under development compete or will compete with products marketed by a number of manufacturers  including advanced cardiovascular systems  inc  a subsidiary of guidant corporation acs  scimed life systems  inc  a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation scimed  johnson johnson interventional systems jjis and cordis corporation  subsidiaries of johnson johnson  medtronic  inc  cr bard  inc 
and schneider usa  a subsidiary of pfizer  inc such companies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  established market positions  and significantly larger sales and marketing organizations than does the company 
the company also faces competition from manufacturers of other catheter based devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat vascular disease 
in addition  the company believes that many of the customers and potential customers of the company s products prefer to purchase catheter and stent products from a single source 
accordingly  many of the company s competitors  because of their size and range of product offerings  have a competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more clinically effective or cost effective than any that are being marketed or developed by the company  or that such competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for introducing or commercializing any such products prior to the company

limited manufacturing experience 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with iso  the fda s qsr requirements  california department of health services cdhs licensing and other regulatory requirements  in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
the company began manufacturing certain of its products at its facilities in july the company also introduced a significant number of new products in and accordingly  the company has limited experience in manufacturing its products 
the company has undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular qsr inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
the company s success will depend  among other things  on its ability to efficiently manage the simultaneous manufacture of different products and to integrate the manufacture of new products with existing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
the company s failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of these new products  or to increase production volumes of new or existing products in a timely manner  would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to increase production volumes in a timely or cost effective manner or to achieve or maintain compliance with iso  qsr requirements  cdhs licensing or other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company purchases many standard and custom built components from independent suppliers and subcontracts certain manufacturing processes from independent vendors 
most of these components and processes are available from more than one vendor 
however  certain manufacturing processes are currently performed by single vendors 
an interruption of performance by any of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products until a new source of supply was qualified and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

potential inability to manage growth 
prior to june  the company historically relied on endosonics to perform certain activities on its behalf  including manufacturing  financial  regulatory and administrative functions 
since july  cvd has conducted its manufacturing operations at its facilities in irvine and also currently performs the financial  regulatory and administrative functions previously performed by endosonics 
accordingly  the company has experienced a period of significant expansion of its operations that has placed a significant strain upon its management systems and resources 
the company has implemented a number of new financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
the company also plans to expand the geographic scope of its customer base and operations 
this expansion has resulted and will continue to result in substantial demands on the company s management resources 
the company s ability to manage future expansion of its operations will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and to expand  train and manage its employee work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation 
the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the company believes that its success will be significantly dependent upon commercial sales of improved versions of its catheter and coronary stent products 
the company will not be able to market these new products in the united states unless and until the company obtains approval or clearance from the fda 
foreign and domestic regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
if a medical device manufacturer can establish that a newly developed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or to a class iii device that the fda has not called for a premarket approval pma  the manufacturer may seek clearance from the fda to market the device by filing a premarket notification with the fda under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act k 
all of the k clearances received for the company s catheters were based on substantial equivalence to legally marketed devices 
there can be no assurance that k clearance for any future product or significant modification of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be unduly lengthy 
in addition  if the fda has concerns about the safety or effectiveness of any of the company s products  it could act to withdraw approval or clearances of those products or request that the company present additional data 
any such actions would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if substantial equivalence cannot be established  or if the fda determines that the device or the particular application for the device requires a more rigorous review to assure safety and effectiveness  the fda will require that the manufacturer submit a pma application that must be reviewed and approved by the fda prior to sales and marketing of the device in the united states 
the pma process is significantly more complex  expensive and time consuming than the k clearance process and always requires the submission of clinical data 
it is expected that certain of the company s products under development will be subject to this pma process 
in february  the fda approved the company s pma application and  so  the company can now independently seek approval of its products 
the company is also required to register as a medical device manufacturer with the fda and maintain a license with certain state agencies  such as the cdhs 
as such  the company is inspected on a routine basis by both the fda and the cdhs for compliance with qsr requirements 
these regulations require that the company manufacture its products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and control activities 
the company has also undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular qsr inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
further  the company is required to comply with various fda requirements for labeling 
the medical device reporting laws and regulations require that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
in addition  the fda prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved applications 
cvd has received fda approval to market the fact and arc catheters  which utilize the focus technology  for coronary balloon angioplasty 
these catheters are marketed outside the united states for use in stent deployment 
however  without specific fda approval for stent deployment  these catheters may not be marketed by the company in the united states for such use 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other consequences  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
in addition  government regulations may be established in the future that could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of the company s products 
delays in receipt of clearances or approvals  failure to receive clearances or approvals or the loss of previously received clearances or approvals would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices 
the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business products and item business government regulation 
international sales of the company s products are subject to the regulatory requirements in many countries 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data 
the company typically relies on its distributors in such foreign countries to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance  however  that such approvals will be obtained on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  the fda must approve the export to certain countries of devices that require a pma but are not yet approved domestically 
generally  in order to continue selling its products within the european economic area and switzerland following june   the company will be required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the medical devices directive mdd and affix ce marking on its products to attest to such compliance 
the company believes that products which have already been delivered to distributors will be able to continue to be sold by such distributors during a subsequent three year transition period 
to achieve compliance  the company s products must meet the essential requirements of the mdd relating to safety and performance and the company must successfully undergo verification of its regulatory compliance conformity assessment by a notified body selected by the company 
the company has selected tuv product service of munich  germany as its notified body 
the nature of such assessment depends on the regulatory class of the product  and the many of the company s coronary products are currently in class iii  the highest risk class  and therefore subject to the most rigorous controls 
in december  the company received iso en certification from its notified body with respect to the manufacturing of all of its products 
this certification applies to the manufacturing operations in the company s irvine facilities and its contracted manufacturing facility in nieuwegein  netherlands 
in january  the company obtained the right to affix ce marking to all of its products currently sold in all countries of the european economic area and switzerland 
the company will be subject to continued supervision by its notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities 
the company also will be required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the mdd 
with respect to products not already cleared for ce marking  the company will need to comply with the ce marking requirements prior to june   or else it will be unable to sell such additional products in the european economic area or switzerland unless and until compliance is achieved 
failure to achieve such compliance could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain compliance required for ce marking on all or any of its products or that it will be able to timely and profitably produce its products while complying with the requirements of the mdd and other regulatory requirements 
limited marketing and sales resources  dependence upon strategic partners 
cvd intends to rely primarily on certain strategic relationships  medical device distributors and its direct sales organization to distribute its products  some of which are competitors of the company 
see item risk factors significant competitors 
the company s ability to distribute its products successfully depends in part on the marketing capabilities of its strategic partners 
in recent years there has been significant consolidation among medical device suppliers as the major suppliers have attempted to broaden their product lines in order to respond to cost pressures from health care providers 
this consolidation has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers  such as the company  to distribute their products effectively without a relationship with one or more of the major suppliers 
the company is currently marketing certain of its products through licensing agreements with scimed and acs 
in addition  cathex co  ltd 
cathex is currently the company s exclusive distributor in japan for certain products 
cathex is also responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the company s products in japan 
the company s revenue from its distributor relationships is dependent upon the efforts made by such parties and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or expand its relationships with its strategic partners or to replace its strategic partners in the event any such relationship were terminated 
in the event of such a termination  the company s ability to distribute its products would be materially adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cvd currently has a limited marketing and sales staff 
the company intends to expand its direct sales force to market the company s expanded product offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that cvd will successfully expand its direct sales and marketing organization  or that if expanded  such organization will be able to effectively distribute cvd s products 
if cvd is unable to achieve distribution of its products through its direct sales organization  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company also has a product development relationship with scimed 
in prior years  scimed funded certain research and development efforts undertaken by cvd in the area of combined drug delivery and coronary angioplasty 
if cvd is unable to obtain new relationships its product development efforts could be materially adversely affected 
any disruption of the company s product development efforts would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

limitations on third party reimbursement 
in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by medical institutions  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid  and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group drg established by the us health care financing administration hcfa 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed  and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
reimbursement of interventional procedures utilizing the company s products is currently covered under a drg 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such procedures will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
in addition  reimbursement may be denied if the product use is not in accordance with approved fda labeling 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

control by existing stockholder  limitations on pooling of interests accounting in merger transactions 
endosonics owns approximately of the company s outstanding voting common stock 
as a result of the cumulative voting provision in the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation  endosonics is virtually assured of electing at least one member to the company s five person board of directors 
the company has proposed an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation to eliminate cumulative voting of directors which will be voted on at the annual meeting of stockholders 
however  even in the event of approval of the amendment  endosonics  as the company s largest single stockholder  will be able to exert significant influence over the company s affairs and the conduct of its business 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the company is prohibited from accounting for a merger transaction  of or by the company  as a pooling of interests for a period of two years following june   the date on which endosonics ceased to control of the outstanding voting common stock of the company 
as a result  any business combination consummated prior to the expiration of such period would have to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under the purchase method  the excess of the purchase price over the net book value of the assets acquired would be amortized as an expense  which could result in a significant negative impact on the acquirer s results of operations and  therefore  reduce the attractiveness of  or the price paid in  a particular acquisition transaction 
on january   endosonics announced that in connection with the acquisition of cardiometrics  inc cardiometrics by endosonics pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated as of january   among endosonics  river acquisition corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of endosonics  and cardiometrics  shares of the company s common stock held by endosonics would be distributed to the former stockholders  warrantholders and optionholders of cardiometrics 
this acquisition was completed on july   and endosonics distributed a total of  shares of cvd common stock 
after such distribution  endosonics owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
on september   endosonics made a dividend distribution of one cvd share for every endosonics shares to its stockholders and option holders of record on september  the distribution totaled  shares of cvd common stock  and reduced endosonics ownership to approximately  shares or of the company s common stock outstanding 
in february  the company purchased  shares of its common stock from endosonics  thereby reducing their ownership to approximately of the voting common stock outstanding 
potential product liability  limited insurance 
the company faces the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims 
the company s products are often used in situations in which there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
such risks will exist even with respect to those products that have received  or in the future may receive  regulatory approval for commercial sale 
the company is currently covered under a product liability insurance policy with coverage limits of million per occurrence and million per year in the aggregate 
there can be no assurance that the company s product liability insurance is adequate or that such insurance coverage will remain available at acceptable costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant product liability claims in the future 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of the company s products and the company s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products and substantially divert the time and effort of management away from the company s operations 
volatility of stock price 
since the company s initial public offering in june  the price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly 
the company believes that factors such as variations in quarterly results of operations  any future litigation involving the company  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  other developments or disputes with respect to proprietary rights  general trends in the industry and overall market conditions  and other factors  could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for small capitalization stocks in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
effect of certain charter provisions  anti takeover effects of certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prohibit the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
in addition  the company has proposed two amendments to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will be voted on at the annual meeting of stockholders 
one proposal eliminates cumulative voting of directors  while the other proposal divides the board of directors into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
both amendments are designed to protect stockholder interests in the event of hostile takeover attempts against the company 
however  either one of both amendments may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
further  certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
impact of year the company s computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process finance  sales and inventory transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to upgrade portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost is estimated at  since the upgrades will be to existing software  which will be capitalized 
to date  the company has spent a minor amount  primarily for the assessment of the year issue and the development of a modification plan and upgrade of software 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with upgrades of existing software  the year issue will not create significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such upgrades are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resource and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
absence of dividends 
the company has never paid any cash dividends on the common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future
