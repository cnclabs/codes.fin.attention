the credits and allowances are designed to increase market penetration and increase the number of product lines carried by customers by displacing competitors products within customers stores and promoting consolidation of customers suppliers

year compliance the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent in part on its computer software programs and operating systems programs 
the company has been evaluating its programs to identify potential year compliance problems 
this evaluation has led to the selection and implementation of a comprehensive enterprise resource planning package and related programs new system expected to be operational by the second quarter of this new system will be used in several key areas of the company s business including inventory purchasing and management  production planning  forecasting  pricing  sales  shipping and financial reporting and will replace the majority of the company s current programs 
those programs not replaced by the new system are also being evaluated for year compliance and appropriate adjustments have been or will be made to bring them into compliance either through modification or replacement

the company expects that the investment in capital expenditures to implement the new system will be approximately million million incurred as of december  and that the expenses associated with modification of other programs will not be material
