net income for was million compared with million in excluding realized gain loss on investments  gain on sale of subsidiaries  discontinued operations and the special addition to the disability income reserve  lnc earned million for compared to million in this increase is the result of increased earnings in the life insurance annuities  lincoln uk and reinsurance segments 
century compliance the year issue is pervasive and complex and affects virtually every aspect of lnc s businesses 
lnc s computer systems and interfaces with the computer systems of vendors  suppliers  customers and business partners are particularly vulnerable 
the inability to properly recognize date sensitive electronic information and transfer data between systems could cause errors or even a complete systems failure which would result in a temporary inability to process transactions correctly and engage in normal business activities for one or more of lnc s businesses 
lnc is redirecting a large portion of its internal information technology efforts and contracting with outside consultants to update its systems to accommodate the year also  lnc has initiated formal communications with critical parties that interface with lnc s systems to gain an understanding of their progress in addressing year issues 
while lnc is making every effort to address its own systems and the systems with which it interfaces  it is not possible to provide assurance that operational problems will not occur 
lnc presently believes that  with the modification of existing computer systems  updates by vendors and conversion to new software and hardware  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
in addition  lnc is developing contingency plans in the event that  despite its best efforts  there are unresolved year problems 
if the remediation efforts noted above are not completed timely or properly  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operation of lnc s businesses 
during and  lnc identified expenditures of approximately million million after tax that it had spent to address this issue 
lnc s financial plans for include expected expenditures of an additional million million after tax on this issue 
the cost of addressing year issues and the timeliness of completion will be closely monitored by management and are based on management s current best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
nevertheless  there can be no guarantee that these estimated costs will be achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer problems  and other uncertainties 
review of consolidated financial condition as a result of the purchase of a block of individual life insurance and annuity business in january of  select balance sheet accounts described below will increase see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
investments the investment portfolio  excluding cash and invested cash  is comprised of fixed maturity securities  equities  mortgage loans on real estate  real estate  either wholly owned or joint ventures  and other long term investments 
lnc purchases investments for its segmented portfolios with yield  duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported 
the total investment portfolio increased million in this minimal increase was the net result of increases from the fair value of securities available for sale and the new purchases of investments from cash flow generated by the business units being mostly offset by the sale of select investments to raise cash for the january  purchase of a block of individual life insurance and annuity business and the continuation of fixed annuity contractholders opting to transfer funds to variable annuity contracts 
lnc maintains a high quality fixed maturity securities portfolio 
as of december   billion or of its fixed maturity securities portfolio had ratings of aa or better 
fixed maturity securities with below investment grade ratings bb or less were billion or of the total fixed maturity securities portfolio see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the below investment grade fixed maturity securities represent of lnc s total investment portfolio 
the interest rates available on these below investment grade securities are significantly higher than are available on other corporate debt securities 
also  the risk of loss due to default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to such below investment grade securities because these securities are generally unsecured  often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer and issued by companies that usually have high levels of indebtedness 
lnc attempts to minimize the risks associated with these below investment grade securities by limiting the exposure to any one issuer and by closely monitoring the credit worthiness of such issuers 
for the year ended december   the aggregate cost of below investment grade securities purchased was billion 
aggregate proceeds from such investments sold were billion  resulting in a realized pre tax gain at the time of sale of million 
lnc s entire fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio is classified as available for sale and is carried at fair value 
changes in fair values  net of related deferred acquisition costs  amounts required to satisfy policyholder commitments and taxes are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity 
note to the consolidated financial statements on page shows the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december  lnc s fixed maturity securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities 
the mortgage backed securities included in lnc s investment portfolio are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments or delayed repayments 
this may result in these securities having a different actual cash flow and maturity than planned at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss 
those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain 
repayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment or delayed repayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
lnc limits the extent of its risk on mortgage backed securities by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par  by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral  and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield but higher liquidity than higher risk mortgage backed securities 
at selected times  higher risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio 
at december   lnc did not have a significant amount of higher risk mortgage backed securities 
there are negligible default risks in the mortgage backed securities portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by us government sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status 
note to the consolidated financial statements on page shows additional detail about the underlying collateral 
as of december   mortgage loans on real estate and investments in real estate represented and of the total investment portfolio 
as of december   the underlying properties supporting the mortgage loans on real estate consisted of in commercial office buildings  in retail stores  in apartments  in industrial buildings  in hotels motels and in other 
in addition to the dispersion by type of property  the mortgage loan portfolio is geographically diversified throughout the united states 
cash and invested cash cash and invested cash increased by billion in this increase is the result of accumulating funds at the end of in anticipation of the purchase of a block of individual life and annuity business on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs decreased million in this decrease was the net result of an increase related to the growth in business being more than offset by decreases related to the write off of such costs in conjunction with the strengthening of disability income reserves see note to the consolidated financial statements on page and reductions related to the increase in unrealized gain on securities available for sale 
premiums and fees receivable premiums and fees receivable decreased million in as the result of decreased volumes of business in the reinsurance segment more than offsetting the increase in volumes of business in the investment management segment 
assets held in separate accounts this asset account  as well as the corresponding liability account  increased by billion in as a result of increases in annuity and pension funds under management 
this increase resulted from new deposits  market appreciation and the continuation of fixed annuity contractholders opting to transfer funds to variable annuity contracts 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers the increase of million in amounts recoverable from reinsurers was the result of an increased volume of business ceded in the life insurance and annuities segment 
goodwill the increase of million is the net result of additions related to business acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements on page being more than the on going amortization 
other intangible assets the decrease of million is the net result of additions related to the purchase of subsidiary see note to the consolidated financial statements on page being more than offset by the on going amortization and an adjustment to the lincoln uk amount to more closely conform this segments classifications to lnc s us operations 
other assets the decrease in other assets of million is the result of having a lower receivable related to investment securities sold in the last few days of versus the end of total liabilities total liabilities from continuing operations increased by billion in the primary item underlying this increase is the increase of billion related to separate accounts see explanation under assets held in separate accounts above 
the increase of million in insurance policy and claim reserves is the result of increased volumes of business and reserve strengthening as described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page the reduction in contractholder funds is the net result of new deposits being more than offset by the withdrawal of guaranteed interest contract funds because of the decision to exit this business 
the increases in the other liability categories essentially offset the reduction in contractholder funds 
the increase in other liabilities relates to an increase in the expected payouts for securities purchased in the last few days of versus a lower volume of such transactions late in while it is management s judgement that  based on available information  the appropriate level of liabilities have been recorded  lnc has areas where changes in estimates of related liabilities required could occur in the near term 
these areas include claims for disability income coverages  liabilities and recoveries related to inappropriate selling of pension products in the united kingdom  liabilities for marketing and compliance issues  the reserve for the run off of group pension annuities and liabilities for personal accident programs see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million during the year ended december  excluding the increase of million related to an increase in the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale  shareholders equity increased million 
this increase in shareholders equity was the net result of increases due to million of net income  million from the issuance of stock related to the purchase of subsidiary companies and million from the issuance of common stock related to benefit plans and decreases of million related to the declaration of dividends to shareholders  million related to a decrease in the accumulated foreign exchange gain and million for the retirement of common stock 
capital adequacy is a primary measure used by insurance regulators to determine the financial stability of an insurance company 
in the us  risk based capital guidelines are used by the national association of insurance commissioners to determine the amount of capital that represents minimum acceptable operating amounts related to insurance and investment risks 
regulatory action is triggered when an insurer s statutory basis capital falls below the formula produced capital level 
at december   statutory basis capital for each of lnc s us insurance subsidiaries was substantially in excess of regulatory action levels of risk based capital required by the jurisdiction of domicile 
as noted above  shareholders equity includes net unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale 
at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities and at december   the book value of per share included of unrealized gains on securities 
a significant portion of both realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments that support long term life insurance  pension and annuity contracts are expected to be applied to contract benefits 
these realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in net income and shareholders equity  respectively 
current accounting standards do not require or permit adjustment of policyholder reserves to recognize the full effect of these realized and unrealized gains or losses on future benefit payments in the absence of a contractual obligation requiring their attribution to policyholders 
market risk exposures of financial instruments lnc analyzes and manages the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments  as well as other risks  in an integrated asset liability management process that takes diversification into account 
by aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks of the entire enterprise  lnc estimates  reviews and in some cases manages the risk to its earnings and shareholder value 
lnc has material exposures to several market risks including interest rate  default risk  foreign currency exchange and equity price risks 
the exposures of financial instruments to market risks  and the related risk management processes  are most important in the life insurance and annuities segment 
this segment is where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
as an important element of its integrated asset liability management process  lnc uses derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest rate levels and the shape of the yield curve 
in this context  derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of large rises in interest rates on lnc s stream of earnings 
additional market exposures exist in lnc s other general account insurance products and in its debt structure and derivatives positions 
the primary sources of market risk are substantial  relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates  fluctuations in currency exchange rates a sharp drop in equity market values 
each of these market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages 
interest rate risk accumulation and investment oriented insurance products 
general account assets supporting accumulation and investment oriented insurance products total billion or of total invested assets 
fixed maturity and equity securities are held at fair value on the balance sheet  mortgage loans on real estate are held at amortized cost and real estate is held at cost less depreciation while liabilities are generally held at account values less surrender charges see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
the fair values for mortgage loans on real estate and guaranteed interest rate contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis while fixed annuities and other deposit liabilities are at policy cash surrender value see note to the consolidated financial statements on page 
with respect to these products  lnc seeks to earn a stable and profitable spread between investment income and interest credited to account values 
if lnc has adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed through to customers  its spreads are reduced 
alternatively  lnc may seek to maintain spreads and this may result in crediting rates that are not competitive in the market place 
this strategy could result in adverse surrender experience on policies and could force lnc to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund excess cash surrender value benefits 
lnc does not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material 
the combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months  asset liability management strategies  flexibility in adjusting crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to minimize this risk 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
fixed deferred annuities 
assets of billion supports the biggest category of accumulation and investment oriented insurance products  fixed deferred annuities 
for these products  lnc may adjust renewal crediting rates monthly or annually  subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to 
the higher minimums apply to in force blocks of older products that no longer are sold 
annuity insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
due to lnc s ability to change crediting rates to reflect investment experience  the underlying assets are assumed to be a good proxy for the interest rate risk inherent in these liabilities 
this assumption is appropriate for probable movements in interest rates over the next months 
this assumption may not be appropriate for a substantial  relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period 
universal life 
lnc has billion in assets supporting universal life insurance on which it has the right to adjust renewal crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums ranging from to at december  similar to annuities  universal life insurance customers have the right to surrender their policies at account value less a surrender charge that grades to zero over periods ranging from to years from policy issue date or  in some cases  the date of each premium received 
guaranteed interest contracts and group pension annuities 
lnc has assets totaling billion that support guaranteed interest contracts  group pension annuities and immediate annuities 
generally  the cash flows expected on these liabilities do not vary with fluctuations in market interest rates and are not adjustable by lnc 
accordingly  if experience on the assets supporting these products is more adverse than the assumptions used in pricing the products  spreads will tend to be below expectations 
lnc limits exposure to interest rate risk by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment portfolio in relation to the liabilities it supports 
other general account insurance products 
lnc has billion of assets supporting general account products  including disability income and term life insurance 
for these products  the liability cash flows may have actuarial uncertainty 
however  their amounts and timing do not vary significantly with interest rates 
lnc limits interest rate risk by analyzing the duration of the projected cash flows and structuring investment portfolios with similar durations 
interest rate risk falling rates 
after rising in  interest rates fell in  rose again in and declined in for example  the five year treasury yield rose from to during and fell back to at the end of  increased to by the end of and decreased to by the end of under scenarios in which interest rates fall and remain at levels significantly lower than those prevailing at december   minimum guarantees on annuity and universal life insurance policies generally to or an average of approximately could cause the spread between the yield on the portfolio and the interest rate credited to policyholders to deteriorate 
select contracts that specify these minimum guarantees can be amended periodically to reflect current interest rate conditions 
the earned rate on the annuity and universal life insurance portfolios averaged and  respectively  for the year ended december   providing a cushion for further decline before the earned rates would be insufficient to cover minimum guaranteed rates plus the target spread 
the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of this cushion for a period of time 
however  spreads would be at risk if interest rates continued to fall and remained lower for a long period 
lnc manages these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting its exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
lnc believes that the portfolios supporting its accumulation and investment oriented insurance products have a prudent degree of call protection individually and on a consolidated basis 
the mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs portion of the portfolio represents a total of billion or of the billion of general account assets supporting such products 
of this portfolio  of general account assets or billion is subject to residential prepayment risk from investments made in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  mortgage pass throughs  manufactured housing and home equity loans 
lnc s mbs portfolio has equal to or slightly less prepayment risk than the mbs pass through market in general primarily due to holding more seasoned securities in the portfolio 
due to the combination of recent lower interest rates and increased efficiency by mortgage holders in exercising their prepayment options  the riskiness of these securities has increased over the last few years without a compensating adjustment to risk premiums 
this trend has also reduced the degree of protection provided by the purchase of protected amortization class cmos 
as a result  lnc has reduced its exposure to the mbs asset class in recent years 
interest rate risk rising rates 
for both annuities and universal life insurance  a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mbs prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if lnc sets renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between its renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders 
if lnc credits more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  its spreads will narrow 
lnc devotes extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions see discussion below 
with this hedge  the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within corporate risk tolerances 
lnc believes that the risks of rising interest rates are also mitigated by its emphasis on periodic premium products 
debt 
lnc has short term debt  long term debt  and minority interest preferred securities of subsidiary companies totaling billion million of this debt is at fixed rates and million is at floating rates 
lnc manages the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise 
derivatives 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  lnc has entered into derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to rapid rises in interest rates 
the four programs discussed below are used to help lnc achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are rising 
failure to maintain competitive crediting rates could cause policyholders to withdraw their funds and place them in more competitive products 
lnc uses interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
interest rate caps are contracts that require counterparties to pay lnc at specified future dates the amount  if any  by which a specified market interest rate exceeds the cap rate stated in the agreements  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of billion with cap rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
the cap rates in some contracts increase over time 
these agreements expire in through lnc also uses swaptions to hedge against the negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates 
swaptions are options to enter into a swap at a specified future date 
if the option is exercised at expiration  the option is either settled in cash or exercised into a swap agreement 
lnc purchases swaptions to be settled in cash 
at expiration  the counterparty is required to pay lnc the amount  if any  of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate on a market rate swap and the strike rate stated in the agreement  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of billion with strike rates ranging from to basis points above prevailing interest rates 
these agreements expire in and for future periods  the fair value of lnc s interest rate caps and swaptions depends on the levels of interest rates on us treasury securities with maturities of two  five  seven and years and us dollar swap rates with five  seven and year maturities 
the table below analyzes fair value levels at december  and for the next five years if the rates were     or higher than they were at december  in relation to the level of these rates at december   the cap and swaption rates were from to out of the money  ie  higher 
the table below shows the fair value levels of interest rate caps and swaptions under these scenarios 
year ended december in millions no change 


up 

up up up up up lnc uses exchange traded financial futures contracts and options on financial futures to hedge against interest rate risks and to manage duration of a portion of its fixed maturity securities 
financial futures contracts obligate lnc to buy or sell a financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price 
they may be settled in cash or through delivery of the financial instrument 
cash settlements on the change in market values of financial futures contracts are made daily 
put options on a financial futures contract give lnc the right  but not the obligation  to assume a long or short position in the underlying futures contract at a specified price during a specified time period 
as of december   lnc did not have any open futures or options on futures 
lnc uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to floating rate bond coupon payments  replicating a fixed rate bond 
an interest rate swap is a contractual agreement to exchange payments at one or more times based on the actual or expected price  level  performance or value of one or more underlying interests 
lnc is required to pay the counterparty the stream of variable coupon payments generated from the bonds  and in turn  receives a fixed payment from the counterparty  at a predetermined interest rate 
as of december   lnc had a swap agreement with a notional amount of million that expires in in addition to continuing existing programs  lnc may use derivative products in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns  particularly in the management of investment spread businesses 
lnc has established policies  guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in lnc s operations

foreign currency risk foreign currency denominated investments 
lnc invests in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to united states dollar denominated usd securities 
the fair value of foreign securities which are denominated in different foreign currencies  as of december  was million 
lnc periodically uses a combination of foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign currency options  and foreign currency swaps to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to its investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies 
the currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds 
unhedged  a adverse move in the currency would create a million pre tax loss 
the aggregate usd equivalent of forward currency positions hedging the portfolio was million  the unhedged amount of the portfolio was million 
a adverse currency move has thus been reduced to million pre tax through hedging

foreign currency forward contracts 
lnc uses foreign currency forward contracts to actively hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to its investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies 
lnc typically engages in short term currency forward contracts of less than six months and actively monitors currency markets in determining those currencies to hedge  the duration of the hedge and the nominal amount to hedge 
a foreign currency forward contract obligates lnc to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date at a specified exchange rate 
the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts at any given point fluctuates according to the underlying level of exchange rate and interest rate differentials 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million in foreign exchange forward contracts for an average overall hedge ratio of 
these contracts include hedges against british pounds hedged  japanese yen hedged and italian lira hedged with average forward foreign exchange rates of  and  respectively 
lnc periodically uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against foreign exchange risk related to lnc s investment in its british subsidiary  lincoln national uk 
as of december   lnc did not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts related to its investment in lincoln national uk 
foreign currency options 
a foreign currency option gives lnc the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a foreign currency at a specific exchange rate during a specified time period 
lnc has historically used options that were slightly out of the money resulting in a corridor of currency risk assumed  but limited the risk above the strike price 
at december   lnc did not have any open positions in foreign currency options 
foreign currency swaps 
a foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries pursuant to an agreement to re exchange the two currencies at the same rate of exchange at a specified future date 
as of december   lnc had a foreign currency swap with a notional amount of million 
equity market exposures lnc s revenues  assets  liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk 
fee revenues 
the fee revenues of lnc s investment management segment and fees earned from variable annuities are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
these fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals 
such withdrawals from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to lnc s fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to lnc by its competitors customers 
assets 
while lnc invests in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in its core fixed income investments  the returns on  and values of  these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than its fixed income investments 
these investments  however  add diversification benefits to lnc s fixed income investments

    liabilities 
lnc has an exposure to foreign currency equity risk with respect to unit linked annuity policies issued in the uk 
as of december   the aggregate u 
s dollar equivalent amount of account value is million 
lnc also has a small exposure to us equity markets through reinsurance contracts that reinsure equity indexed annuities 
the aggregate amount of account value of these annuities is million 
these risks are being hedged with equity derivatives as discussed below 
derivatives hedging equity risks 
lnc has two programs hedging equity market risk in annuities issued in the uk and uk that contain equity features 
lnc uses over the counter otc foreign currency equity call options to hedge against the foreign equity market risk component contained in its uk unit linked annuities which are a function of the financial times stock exchange ftse index 
these call options require the counterparties to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the percentage increase in the ftse index over the strike price defined in the contract  applied to a notional amount 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million 
the call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire in through lnc uses otc equity call options on the s p index to hedge against the increase in its liabilities resulting from certain reinsurance agreements which guarantee payment of the appreciation of the s p index on certain underlying annuity products 
these call options require the counterparty to pay lnc at specified future expiration dates the amount  if any  of the percentage increase in the s p index over the strike price defined in the contract  applied to the notional amount 
the reinsurance agreement then requires lnc to pay any appreciation on the s p index to the reinsurance client 
as of december   lnc had agreements with notional amounts of million 
the call options expirations are matched to the liabilities and expire in default risk 
in assessing the risk that the rate of default losses for each category of asset may be higher than the rates assumed in pricing its products  lnc considers the entire billion portfolio of invested assets  taking diversification into account 
of this total  billion consists of corporate bonds and billion consists of commercial mortgages 
lnc manages the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  lnc s exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group 
lnc remains exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
lnc is depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under interest rate cap agreements  swaptions  spread lock agreements  interest rate swaps  call options  foreign currency exchange contracts  foreign currency options and foreign currency swaps 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  lnc diversifies its exposures among several dealers and limits the amount of exposure in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
lnc generally limits its selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
credit related derivatives 
lnc periodically uses spread lock agreements to hedge a portion of the value of its fixed maturity securities against the risk of widening in the spreads between their yields and the yields of comparable maturity us or other government obligations 
the actual risk being hedged by these agreements is the potential widening of bond spreads that would be caused by widening swap spreads 
under these agreements  lnc assumed the right and the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date in which lnc would pay a fixed rate equal to a contractually specified spread over the yield of a specified government security and receive a floating rate 
as of december   lnc did not have any open spread lock agreements 
liquidity and cash flow liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety 
because of the interval of time from receipt of a deposit or premium until payment of benefits or claims  lnc and other insurers employ investment portfolios as an integral element of operations 
by segmenting its investment portfolios along product lines  lnc enhances the focus and discipline it can apply to managing the liquidity as well as the interest rate and credit risk of each portfolio commensurate with the profile of the liabilities 
for example  portfolios backing products with less certain cash flows and or withdrawal provisions are kept more liquid than portfolios backing products with more predictable cash flows 
the consolidated statements of cash flows on page indicate that operating activities provided cash of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
this statement also classifies the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities and financing activities and discloses the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet lnc s obligations 
although lnc generates adequate cash flow to meet the needs of its normal operations  periodically lnc may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal expansion  acquisitions  investment opportunities and the retirement of lnc s debt and equity 
as of december   lnc had a shelf registration with an unused balance of million that would allow lnc to issue debt or equity securities 
in  lnc filed another shelf registration for million which included the right to offer various forms of hybrid securities 
these securities  which have a combination of both debt and equity characteristics  are offered through a series of three newly formed trusts lincoln national capital i  ii and iii
