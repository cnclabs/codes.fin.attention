results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain income and expense items as a percentage of net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development merger costs and special charges operating loss profit other income  net loss income before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal vs 
fiscal net revenue net revenue for fiscal year decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year this overall decrease is attributable to the downturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry which resulted in a significant slowdown in the construction or expansion of semiconductor fabs 
the decrease was partially offset by increased shipments  resulting from increased design wins  of both mm and mm tool automation products to oem semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
net export sales to customers comprised  or of revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit the company s gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the reduction in margin was caused by changes in product mix as well as excess capacity and related manufacturing costs that could not be reduced proportionally with the decline in production volume 
furthermore  the industry downturn increased competitive pricing pressure 
additionally  there were  in charges during the fiscal year related to inventory and warranty provisions 
excluding these charges  the gross profit margins would have been 
research and development research and development expenses increased to  or approximately of net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the dollar amount of research and development spending reflects the company s continued investment in new product developments and enhancements of existing products 
the company continued to invest in the development of mm and mm products throughout the tool automation and factory automation product lines and advanced planning and scheduling software products 
the company believes that these investments are critical to maintaining and improving its market share 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  or of net revenue for fiscal year compared to  or of net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
during the second half of fiscal  the company reduced its operating expenses by  compared with operating levels during the first half of fiscal the company had two reductions in force totaling approximately of the work force

acquired in process research and development on october  the company acquired interval logic corporation ilc  a california corporation  for aggregate consideration of  shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company issued or assumed options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
ilc was formed in to develop advanced  high performance planning and scheduling software solutions for the semiconductor industry 
the value of the transaction was  including approximately  of expenses related to the acquisition 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
at the time of the acquisition  the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets of ilc based on the fair market value of those assets using a risk adjusted discounted cash flow approach 
specifically  the purchased technology was evaluated through extensive interviews and analysis of data concerning the state of the technology and needed developments 
this evaluation of underlying technology acquired considered the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the development  and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and the risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
at the time of the acquisition  the fair value of  of the acquired technology that had not reached technological feasibility was expensed as in process research and development 
the significant further investments in development required and currently underway to meet expected customer requirements is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year this effort is estimated to take approximately engineering man months at a cost of approximately  this project includes completion of the software requirement definition  data integration and validation  completion of the graphics user interface  development of alpha and beta versions for customer testing  and integration and adaptation with customer systems 
the underlying technology had no alternative future use to the company in other research and development projects or otherwise 
merger costs and special charges during fiscal year the company incurred certain special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired equipe in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
direct acquisition costs  primarily related to legal  investment banking  and accounting fees  amounted to  and were charged against the results of operations in the quarter

the special charges primarily included provisions for severance compensation of  resulting from terminations of approximately personnel completed in  costs of  relating to reductions of leased facilities space and a non cash write down of specialized demonstration equipment for a particular customer of  associated with the closure of the customer training site that is not usable elsewhere 
at september    of restructuring charges remained in accrued expenses associated with the severance and lease reductions totaling  the employee severance and lease reduction costs are considered restructuring charges 
the company expects the remaining accrued restructuring costs of  at september  to be paid by the end of fiscal operating loss profit as a result of the decline in revenue and the other foregoing factors  for fiscal year the company experienced an operating loss of  or negative of net revenue  compared to an operating profit of  or of net revenue for the prior fiscal year

interest income was  and  for fiscal and  respectively  and interest expense for the years ended september  and amounted to  and  respectively 
while net interest income increased in fiscal due to higher average cash and investment balances  this income was offset by increases in other expenses experienced in fiscal benefit from provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal year was  compared to a provision of  for the previous fiscal year 
the effective tax rate reflects a benefit for fiscal year compared to a provision for the prior fiscal year 
the change is primarily due to the charges for acquired in process research and development and merger costs  which are not fully deductible for tax purposes  and the fact that two of the equipe combined companies were not subject to federal income tax prior to january  due to their s corporation status 
the company has recognized a net deferred tax asset of  at september  the company believes it is more likely than not that its total net deferred tax asset of  will be realized 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net revenue net revenue for fiscal year increased to  compared to  for fiscal year this increase resulted from greater market acceptance of  and demand for  the company s flexible factory automation and tool automation systems  as a result of semiconductor manufacturers continuing upgrades and expansion of existing fabrication facilities and construction of new facilities  and from the company s growth in europe and in the asia pacific region 
net export sales to unaffiliated customers comprised  or of net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of net revenue for the prior fiscal year

the effective tax rate increased for fiscal year to as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this effective tax rate is based on the fact that equipe technologies and a related company acquired by the company were not subject to federal income taxes prior to the acquisition due to s corporation status 
the s corporation income was higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year resulting in a lower effective tax rate in fiscal year elimination of certain valuation allowances placed against certain deferred tax assets also contributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations primarily through bank lines of credit  public stock offerings in october and july and cash generated from operations

in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s shipment level and profitability and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many of such factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information or future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply 
this recurring over supply often has had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital expenditures  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will be subject to similar fluctuations 
also  the recent high rate of technical innovation and resulting improvements in the performance and price of semiconductor devices  which have driven much of the demand for the company s products  could slow  or encounter limits  in the future 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties posed by the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties the lengthy sales cycle for the company s products  and the consequent need to invest substantial resources on sales efforts with no assurance that a sale will result  the company s dependence on a limited number of customers  delays in the expected transition to mm manufacturing technology  the company s ability to manage growth in periods of fluctuating demand  the company s ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses into its operations  risks associated with a substantial and increasing percentage of sales to customers in other countries  intense competition from daifuku co  ltd 
and others  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  delays in introducing new products and systems or in manufacturing products and systems able to meet the complex technical requirements of customers  dependence on sole source suppliers or on a limited number of suppliers for components or specialized processes  the ability to protect the company s intellectual property and the risk that others could assert intellectual property claims against the company  dependence on key executive officers and employees  and risks associated with the asian financial crisis 
the current economic and financial uncertainty in certain asian countries has delayed some orders from customers in these countries  and could cause future delays and cancellations 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price

subsequent events on november   the company agreed to acquire promis systems corporation ltd  promis  a toronto based canadian corporation traded on the toronto stock exchange 
promis is a leading developer of manufacturing execution systems  or mes  software for semiconductor and precision electronics manufacturers 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will issue approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of promis 
the acquisition is intended to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to be completed during the first calendar quarter of  subject to  among other things  regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of promis 
year general many computer systems and software products are expected to experience problems handling dates beyond the year because the systems are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code fields 
inability of the company s products  or of products and systems on which the company relies  to process these dates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company has implemented a company wide year project the project with the objective of minimizing the impact of year issues on its products  services  infrastructure  and internal business support applications 
the project s goals are to ensure year readiness and compliance for i all of the company s products  ii all business systems that are used by the company  and iii all critical business services or products provided to the company by its vendors 
project the company has created and is currently implementing a plan intended to ensure that all of the company s processes and systems have been assessed  tested and made year compliant 
the company engaged the services of an information technology consulting firm to assist in the program management of the project  and has created a project team which includes representatives from each of the company s divisions 
the year project has been in operation since and is proceeding on schedule 
the project is addressing the impact of year on company products  internal it systems  internal non it systems  and systems and products of the company s suppliers and other third parties 
the steps in completing the project are identify software systems and products that pose potential year issues  assess the year readiness of each item identified  develop and implement programs that will achieve year compliance  test to verify compliance  and develop contingency plans as required 
at september   the project is in various stages of progress as discussed below pri products the company is in the process of completing the testing and verification portion of the project for all of its products 
this segment of the project is on schedule and is expected to be completed by early internal it systems the company has assessed its internal information technology  or it  systems  including business information systems  systems utilized in its manufacturing and service operations  and systems providing electronic interfaces between the company and its customers  to determine whether the company s operations will be interrupted by year issues 
the company is currently in the process of testing and verifying year compliance of its internal it systems 
this segment of the project is on schedule and is expected to be completed by june  internal non it systems internal non it systems include telecommunications systems  security systems  hvac systems and utilities 
testing of these systems is ongoing and is expected to be completed by march  supply chain the company has been working with suppliers and other third parties upon which it is dependent to determine the extent of their year compliance 
the company s inquiry and assessment of their year readiness is ongoing and is expected to be completed in early costs based on its investigation to date  the company does not expect the total cost of its year project to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately  the total amount charged to expense through september  was approximately  the remaining amounts are expected to be spent during risk the project is intended to reduce the company s risk of experiencing significant year problems 
based on the progress that the company has made to date in addressing its year issues  and its plan and timetable to complete the project  the company does not anticipate significant interruption of normal operations 
the risk posed by year issues depends substantially on the number and type of any instances of non compliance that have not yet been discovered by the company 
to the extent that the company s internal systems  or products and services obtained from third parties  are found not to be year compliant  the company could face disruptions in its business which could  in turn  cause delays in meeting production and shipping goals and could divert significant management resources 
to minimize potential disruptions  the company intends to adopt a contingency plan  if deemed necessary  to address any issues raised during the completion of the assessment and testing phases of the project 
because no specific instance of material year non compliance has been discovered to date  the company has not adopted a contingency plan to deal with year issues
