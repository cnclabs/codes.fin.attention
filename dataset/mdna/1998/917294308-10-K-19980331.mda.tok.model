under the new strategy  the company will focus its efforts toward specific industry vertical markets the company believes will offer the greatest revenue and profit growth potential 
the company has historically employed multiple channels of distribution which combined the company s direct sales and support resources with qualified third party remarketers 
as part of its new strategic plan  the company will channel its sales efforts through selected distributors and vars capable of providing the level of support and expertise required in the real time manufacturing and process control application market

this business has historically been engaged in the sale of automatic identification auto id equipment  distributed management software and related integration services that allow remote  real time data collection using a variety of automatic identification techniques

as a result of this decision  the company s revenues and operating expenses for the years presented herein reflect only the software operations with the net results of the systems operations reported on its statements of operations as a single line item entitled income from discontinued systems operations 
the company does not currently anticipate it will incur either a loss on disposal or from operations until the time of disposal of the systems operations and has not therefore accrued for any such loss as of december  risks and uncertainties except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
potential risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change the market for computer software in general is characterized by rapid changes in computer hardware and software technology and is highly competitive 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving end user requirements and achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or product enhancements on a timely basis or in a manner that satisfies customers needs or achieves market acceptance 
dependence on principal product families the company currently derives substantially all of its software operations net sales from licenses of the company s factorylink ecs family of products and related support services 
while the company plans on broadening its product families  it expects that factorylink ecs products will continue to account for a substantial portion of its software operations net sales 
intense competition some of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors have been or could be acquired by larger  stronger companies  thus increasing their competitive resources 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not be better positioned to adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources that the company to the promotion and sales of products 
the company s competitors may also increase their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing 
timing of sales the software operations of the company have historically operated with little backlog because software products are shipped as orders are received 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
if net sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  the loss of a significant customer  the addition of a new large customer  or changes in seasonal patterns of capital spending by customers of the company would affect the company s financial results 
dependence on key personnel the company believes its future success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of its senior management  certain members of which have only recently joined the company  as well as its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  contractors and other senior personnel 
in particular  the marketplace for skilled  technical employees and contractors in the company s business is extremely competitive 
although the company expects to be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and contractors for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so

impact of year issue the company is currently addressing the year issue  which results from the fact that many computer programs were previously written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year
