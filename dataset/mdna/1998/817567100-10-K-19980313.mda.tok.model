financial statement presentation since the ipo  the financial presentation of the company has changed 
the combination was accounted for using the historical cost basis of the predecessor companies in accordance with sab on july   sab was adopted to replace sab for certain combination transactions 
in accordance with the provisions of sab  the presentation of financial information for the company reflects the acquiring company as the acquiror of the other predecessor companies 
prior financial statements of the combined predecessor companies are not included in the company s historical financial presentation 
the operation of the predecessor companies and other acquired companies except for the pooled companies have been included in the company s financial statements from their respective effective dates of acquisition 
the acquired companies historically have been managed as independent private companies and  as such  their results of operations reflect different tax structures which have influenced  among other things  their historical levels of owner s compensation 
owners and certain key employees of the acquired companies have agreed to certain reductions in their compensation in connection with the acquisitions 
components of income net revenue of the acquired companies has been derived primarily from the installation  service and maintenance of central air conditioners  furnaces and heat pumps in existing homes 
net revenue and associated income from operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations resulting from increased demand for the company s services during warmer weather in the summer months and during colder weather in winter months  particularly in the beginning of each season 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of purchased materials such as replacement air conditioning units and heat pumps and the labor associated with both installations and repair orders 
the main components of selling  general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  insurance expense and promotion and advertising expenses 
preferred vendor program the company s preferred vendor program was designed with flexibility to ensure competitive prices and services at the local level and at the same time reduce certain administrative and operational costs in the system 
the preferred vendor program will also help to offset corporate costs 
at each service center  the company s managers have the freedom to determine the best source s of products for their customers needs 
the company has developed a strategic relationship with several vendors and requests that the service centers support them when possible and practical 
the benefits available to the service center by utilizing this select list of vendors are significant and although the programs are voluntary  they are widely used in almost every service center 
included in the preferred vendor program are recognized national brands in manufacturing including the trane company  lennox industries  inc and amana  and distribution channels including watsco  inc  pameco corp 
and hughes supply  inc results of operations because of the significant effect of the combination  the acquisitions of the acquired companies and the anticipated effect of pending acquisitions on the company s results of operations  the company s historical results of operations and period to period comparisons will not be indicative of future results and may not be meaningful 
the company plans to continue acquiring service centers in the future 
the integration of acquired service centers and the addition of management personnel to support existing and future acquisitions may positively or negatively affect the company s results of operations during the period immediately following acquisition

cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the acquisition of hvac businesses 
the company s ability to acquire new hvac businesses will depend on a number of factors  including the ability of management of the company to identify favorable target businesses and to negotiate favorable acquisition terms  the availability of adequate financing and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying and acquiring service centers  that the company can integrate such new service centers into the company s operations or that the company s new service centers will generate sales revenue or profit margins consistent with those of the company s existing service centers

management believes that the company s existing cash balances  cash generated from operations  and additional borrowings will be sufficient to fund the company s operating needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next months 
management continually evaluates potential strategic acquisitions as part of the company s growth strategy 
to date  such acquisitions have been predominantly funded by issuing shares of common stock  although future acquisitions could be effected using greater amounts of cash 
although the company believes that its financial resources will enable it to consider potential acquisitions  should the company s actual results of operations fall short of  or its rate of expansion significantly exceed  its plans  or should its costs or capital expenditures exceed expectations  the company may need to seek additional financing in the future 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to the company 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on the company s plans to acquire additional hvac businesses

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement 
statement establishes standards for the way public business enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires these enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management of the company is currently reviewing the impact of statement the company will adopt statement on december  and will report interim information effective in the first quarter of impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material effect on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on currently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has determined it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project no later than march   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts on  its year project and the development of a modification plan  purchase of new systems and systems modifications 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements regarding the business and industry of the company  including those regarding the successful integration of the businesses of its subsidiaries  the effective implementation of the company s strategy  the availability of additional hvac businesses for acquisition  the adequacy of the company s capital resources and other statements regarding trends relating to the hvac industry and various revenue and expense items 
many factors  including the company s limited operating history on a combined basis  its aggressive acquisition strategy and the uncertainty that acquisitions can be completed and integrated as planned  the fact that many of the company s operating and information systems are in the development or implementation phase  competition  labor availability  regulatory developments and other uncertainties  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements made in this report 
limited combined operating history the company was incorporated in march and  simultaneously with the closing of the company s ipo on august   consummated the acquisition of the predecessor companies in exchange for shares of common stock and cash 
since the ipo  the company has acquired numerous additional service centers 
because of the limited operating history of the company as a combined entity  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully the businesses of its subsidiaries or to operate profitably 
there can be no assurance that the company s management will be able to manage effectively the combined entity and implement effectively the company s operating and acquisition strategies 
failure to integrate successfully the company s subsidiaries and to implement successfully the company s operating and acquisition strategies could have a material adverse effect on the company s net revenue and earnings 
risks associated with acquisition strategy and financing the success of the company s acquisition strategy will depend on a number of factors  including i the company s ability to locate and successfully negotiate the acquisition of hvac businesses and to successfully integrate the operations of acquired service centers into the company s operations and ii the availability of adequate financing to develop or acquire additional hvac businesses 
in addition  the company competes with other hvac and residential service companies for desirable acquisition candidates 
some of these companies may have access to capital  personnel and other resources equal to or greater than those of the company 
the company expects that its capital needs over the next several years  primarily for acquisitions  will exceed capital generated from operations 
the company plans to incur indebtedness and to issue  from time to time  additional debt or equity securities 
in the event that the common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  or potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  the company may be required to utilize more of its cash resources  if available  in order to maintain its acquisition program 
there can be no assurance that the company s acquisition strategy will be successful  that modifications to the company s strategy will not be required  that the company will be able to manage effectively and enhance the profitability of additional service centers or that the company will be able to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms to develop or acquire additional hvac service businesses 
risks associated with development  implementation  and integration of operating systems and policies as a rapidly growing provider of hvac services  the company is faced with the development  implementation and integration of company wide policies and systems related to its operations 
each of the subsidiaries of the company and companies to be acquired may need  to some extent  to modify or adopt certain systems and policies they have utilized historically in order to implement the company s systems and policies  which management is continuing to formulate 
the company is implementing a uniform computer system and electronic mail system at each of the service centers 
the company plans to implement and integrate certain other information and operating systems and procedures for the service centers including  but not limited to  uniform purchasing programs and certain centralized marketing programs 
the company may experience delays  complications and expenses in implementing  integrating and operating such systems  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  net revenue and earnings 
competition the hvac service and replacement industry is highly competitive 
the company s service centers compete with other full service hvac businesses primarily on the basis of quality  reliability  customer service and price 
several companies have been organized to pursue the acquisition of businesses that offer hvac services 
some of these competitors have access to capital  personnel  marketing and technological resources that are equal to or greater than those of the company 
in certain markets  the company competes with utility companies which have access to capital  personnel  marketing and technological resources that are equal to or greater than those of the company 
because of the fragmented nature of the industry and relatively low barriers to entry  additional competitors  including companies that offer other home improvement services in addition to hvac services  may emerge with greater access than the company to capital  personnel and technological resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that such competition will not make it more difficult to acquire hvac businesses on terms beneficial to the company 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company is dependent upon the continued services of the company s senior management  particularly upon its chairman  president and chief executive officer  alan r 
sielbeck 
the loss of the services of mr 
sielbeck or any of the company s senior management would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business and prospects 
labor availability the timely provision of high quality service by the service centers requires an adequate supply of skilled labor 
in addition  the operating costs of each service center may be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase productivity and net earnings is limited to a degree by its ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet the company s service requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently its service centers or that the company s labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled workers 
seasonal nature of the industry the hvac service industry generally experiences increased demand during the summer and winter months 
the company may  in certain periods  be affected by these seasonal trends 
extended periods of unseasonably mild or wet weather can have an adverse affect on the business of the company 
there can be no assurance that the hvac service and replacement industry will not experience future declines or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
control by management and principal stockholders as of march   directors  officers and stockholders of the company beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these persons have substantial influence over the affairs of the company  including the ability to influence the election of directors and other matters requiring stockholder approval 
regulation hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including  but not limited to  laws and regulations implementing the clean air act  relating to minimum energy efficiency standards of hvac systems and the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in such systems 
in connection with the entry into new markets  the company may become subject to compliance with additional regulations  and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future 
various local  state and federal laws and regulations  including those implementing the clean air act  impose licensing standards on technicians who service heating and air conditioning units 
while the installers and technicians employed by the service centers are duly certified by applicable local  state and federal agencies and have been able to meet or exceed such standards to date  there can be no assurance that they will be able to meet future standards 
in some states  warranties provided for in the company s service agreements may be deemed insurance contracts by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies thereby subjecting the company and the service agreements to the insurance laws and regulations of such state 
certain anti takeover provisions certain provisions of the company s restated certificate of incorporation restated certificate and bylaws and delaware law may make a change in the control of the company more difficult to effect  even if a change in control were in the stockholders interest 
section of the delaware general corporation law would prevent an interested stockholder defined in section  generally  as a person owning or more of the company s outstanding voting stock from engaging in a business combination as defined in section with the company for three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions  including approval by the company s board of directors  are met 
the company s restated certificate and bylaws include certain super majority voting requirements 
the restated certificate also allows the board to determine the terms of preferred stock which may be issued by the company without approval of the holders of the common stock 
the ability of the company to issue preferred stock in this manner could enable the board to prevent changes in management and control of the company 
the board of the company is divided into three classes of directors  with directors being elected for staggered three year terms 
such staggered terms may affect the ability of the holders of the common stock to change control of the company 
in addition  certain provisions of the employment agreements between the company and the executive officers of the company may make a change of control more difficult 
pursuant to these employment agreements  upon a change in control of the company  each executive officer is to be paid as severance pay such officer s base salary for the remaining term of the employment agreement 
volatility of market price from time to time  there may be significant volatility in the market price of the common stock 
quarterly operating results of the company  changes in earnings estimated by analysts  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the company could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance
