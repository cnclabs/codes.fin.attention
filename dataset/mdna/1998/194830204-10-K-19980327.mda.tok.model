the company makes capital expenditures on a recurring basis for replacements and improvements 
as of december   the company s continuing operations had approximately million in outstanding capital expenditure commitments 
the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for continuing operations including its outstanding commitments in fiscal will aggregate approximately million  a portion of which may be financed through leasing 
the company s capital expenditures in future years will depend upon demand for the company s products and changes in technology 
the company is sensitive to price movements in its raw material supply base 
during fiscal  prices for most of the company s primary raw materials remained constant with price levels at december  while the company may not be able to pass on future raw material price increases to its customers  it believes that a significant portion of the increased cost can be offset by continued results of its value engineering value analysis and cost improvement programs and by continued reductions in the cost of nonconformance 
since wallcoverings was classified as a discontinued operation in april  wallcoverings has continued to experience sales declines 
from april through october  the company has expended approximately million to fund operations  working capital and capital expenditures and to replace receivables previously sold to carcorp 
of these amounts  million represents repayments of intercompany amounts owed to wallcoverings 
from november  through its disposition  the company expended approximately million prior to the disposition of wallcoverings principally to fund wallcoverings operations  working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
of this amount  million was the responsibility of the purchaser of wallcoverings under the sales agreement and an estimate  which is subject to adjustment  was included in the purchase price paid at closing 
the company has significant obligations relating to postretirement  casualty  environmental  lease and other liabilities of discontinued operations 
in connection with the sale and acquisition of certain businesses  the company has indemnified the purchasers and sellers for certain environmental liabilities  lease obligations and other matters 
in addition  the company is contingently liable with respect to certain lease and other obligations assumed by certain purchasers and may be required to honor such obligations if such purchasers are unable or unwilling to do so 
management currently anticipates that the net cash requirements of its discontinued operations  excluding wallcoverings  will be approximately million in fiscal however  because the requirements of the company s discontinued operations are largely a function of contingencies  it is possible that the actual net cash requirements of the company s discontinued operations could differ materially from management s estimates 
management believes that the company s cash needs relating to discontinued operations can be provided by operating activities from continuing operations and by borrowings under the bank credit facilities 
tax matters at december   the company had outstanding net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
substantially all of these nols expire over the period from to the company also has unused federal tax credits of approximately million  million of which expire during the period to approximately million of the company s nols and million of the company s unused federal tax credits may be used only against the income and apportioned tax liability of the specific corporate entity that generated such losses or credits or its successors 
future sales of common stock by the company or its principal shareholders  or changes in the composition of its principal shareholders  could constitute a change in control that would result in annual limitations on the company s use of its nols and unused tax credits 
management cannot predict whether such a change in control will occur 
if such a change in control were to occur  the resulting annual limitations on the use of nols and tax credits would depend on the value of the equity of the company and the amount of built in gain or built in loss in the company s assets at the time of the change in control  which cannot be known at this time 
in fiscal  the company s continuing business segments generated substantial operating income  consistent with historical trends  that  when combined with the post recapitalization capital structure  resulted in income for both tax and financial reporting purposes 
the proposed disposition of wallcoverings that was announced in april further clarified management s assessment of the company s likely future performance 
management considered these factors as well as the future outlook for its continuing businesses in concluding that it was more likely than not that previously unrecognized net deferred tax assets totaling approximately million would be realized 
similarly  management concluded that it was more likely than not that net deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  will be realized 
while continued operating performance at current levels is sufficient to realize these assets  the company s ability to generate future taxable income is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic conditions  the state of the automotive industry and other factors beyond management s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectation of future taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  provides for certain deferred tax assets that in management s assessment may not be realized due to tax limitations on the use of such amounts or that relate to tax attributes that are subject to uncertainty due to the long term nature of their realization 
in fiscal  the california franchise tax board issued a notice of tax assessment for approximately million related to the treatment of the sale of certain foreign subsidiaries during the company disputes the assessment and has filed a protest with the franchise tax board 
if the franchise tax board were to maintain its position and such position were to be upheld in litigation  the company would also become liable for the payment of interest which is currently estimated to be million 
in the opinion of management  the final determination of any additional tax and interest liability related to this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that i affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses and ii impose liability for the costs of investigation and remediation and otherwise related to on site and off site soil and groundwater contamination 
the company s management believes that it has obtained  and is in material compliance with  all material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct its various businesses 
environmental compliance costs for continuing businesses currently are accounted for as normal operating expenses or capital expenditures of such business units 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  such environmental compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
the company is legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites 
it also has received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in a number of proceedings 
the company may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
the company is currently engaged in investigation or remediation at certain sites 
in estimating the total cost of investigation and remediation  the company has considered  among other things  the company s prior experience in remediating contaminated sites  remediation efforts by other parties  data released by the united states environmental protection agency  the professional judgment of the company s environmental experts  outside environmental specialists and other experts  and the likelihood that other parties which have been named as prps will have the financial resources to fulfill their obligations at sites where they and the company may be jointly and severally liable 
under the theory of joint and several liability  the company could be liable for the full costs of investigation and remediation even if additional parties are found to be responsible under the applicable laws 
it is difficult to estimate the total cost of investigation and remediation due to various factors including incomplete information regarding particular sites and other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of environmental problems and the company s share  if any  of liability for such problems  the selection of alternative compliance approaches  the complexity of environmental laws and regulations and changes in cleanup standards and techniques 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   including sites relating to the acquisition of c a plastics  jps automotive and perstorp components and excluding sites at which the company s participation is anticipated to be de minimis or otherwise insignificant or where the company is being indemnified by a third party for the liability  there are sites where the company is participating in the investigation or remediation of the site  either directly or through financial contribution  and additional sites where the company is alleged to be responsible for costs of investigation or remediation 
as of december   the company s estimate of its liability for these sites  which exclude sites related to wallcoverings  is approximately million 
as of december   the company has established reserves of approximately million for the estimated future costs related to all its known environmental sites  excluding sites related to wallcoverings 
in the opinion of management  based on the facts presently known to it  the environmental costs and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or future results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company has identified or properly assessed all potential environmental liability arising from the activities or properties of the company  its present and former subsidiaries and their corporate predecessors 
impact of year compliance in order to improve operating performance  the company has undertaken  or will undertake in the near future  a number of significant information systems initiatives 
one goal of such systems initiatives is to make the company s systems year compliant 
based upon a recent assessment  the company expects at this time that the cost of the overall information systems initiatives which includes the cost of ensuring that its remaining computer systems are year compliant should not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has completed a preliminary assessment of each of its operations and their year readiness and believes that appropriate actions are being taken 
the company currently expects to complete its overall year remediation prior to any anticipated impact on its operations 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new systems  the year issue should not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
whether such modifications and conversions are timely completed may to some extent depend on the availability of outside consultants as well as establishing reliable telecommunication links with the company s operations in europe and mexico 
further  while the company has initiated communications with a number of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues  and plans to initiate similar communications with the balance of its major suppliers and major customers in  there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
currency rate exposure the primary purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency purchase transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
the company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts and purchased options with durations of generally less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments or anticipated transactions are included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
to the extent that a qualifying hedge is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any deferred gains and losses up to that point continue to be deferred and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
all other foreign exchange contracts are marked to market on a current basis and are generally charged to other income expense 
to the extent that the anticipated transactions are no longer likely to occur  the related hedges are closed with gains or losses charged to earnings on a current basis 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure at december   including derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments  a near term change in currency rates in amounts indicated by historical currency rate movements would not materially affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company
