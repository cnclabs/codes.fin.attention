the company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of advertisements on its websites  primarily through banner advertisements and sponsorships 
advertising contracts are primarily sold as a run of site contract under which a customer is guaranteed a number of impressions  a key word contract in which a customer purchases the right to advertise in connection with specified word searches  or a targeted contract where the customer purchases a specified number of impressions in one of the web guides or on a specified page or service 
electronic commerce  license and other revenues 
electronic commerce  license and other revenues increased million or  to million for the year ended july   representing of total revenues 
for the previous year ended july   electronic commerce  license and other revenues were million  representing of total revenues 
for the year ended july   the increase in electronic commerce  license and other revenues is attributable primarily to the addition of several new partners during the year  including  among others  at t  barnes and noble  microsoft and cdnow 
electronic commerce revenues are derived principally from slotting fees paid for selective positioning and promotion within the company s suite of products as well as from royalties from the sale of goods and services from the company s websites 
the company s license and product revenues are derived principally from product licensing fees and fees from maintenance and support of its products 
electronic commerce  license and product revenues are generally recognized upon delivery provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the receivable is probable 
in cases where there are significant remaining obligations  the company defers such revenue until those obligations are satisfied 
fees from maintenance and support of the company s products including revenues bundled with the initial licensing fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million or  to million for the year ended july   representing of total revenues 
cost of revenues for the previous year ended july  were million  representing of total revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of expenses associated with the ongoing maintenance and support of the company s products and services  including compensation  consulting fees  equipment costs  networking and other related indirect costs 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased million or  to million for the year ended july   representing of total revenues for the year  but declined as a percentage of total revenues 
for the year ended july   research and development expenses were million  or of total revenues 
research and development expenses consist primarily of equipment and salary costs 
the overall increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased engineering staffing to continue to develop and enhance the company s growing product offerings 
the company believes that significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive 
as a consequence  the company expects to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future 
in process research and development 
upon consummation of the tripod  wisewire  and guestworld acquisitions  the company s management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the respective acquisition dates 
each of these activities was evaluated as of the respective acquisition dates so as to determine their stage of development and related fair value 
the company s review  as of the acquisition date  indicated that the in process research and development had not reached a state of technological feasibility and evidenced no alternative future use 
in the case of in process projects  the company made estimates to quantify the cost to complete for each project  identifying the project date of introduction  the estimated life of the project  the project s fit within the company s own in process research projects  the revenues to be generated in each future period and the corresponding operating expenses and other charges to apply to this revenue stream 
in order to determine the value of the earnings stream attributable to the in process research and development  the excess earnings from the projects were calculated by deducting the earnings stream attributable to all other assets including working capital and tangible assets 
based upon these assumptions  after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project s were determined  appropriately discounted back to its respective net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process projects 
in order to assess the reasonableness of the conclusions reached under the excess earnings discounted future earnings method  the value of the technologies was also estimated using a relief from royalty approach 
under this approach  the value of the technologies is estimated to be the present value of the after tax amounts that the company would otherwise be required to pay to third parties to obtain access to the subject technologies  if it did not already own them 
in applying the method  management estimated a royalty rate and forecasted an estimated royalty stream for the in process technologies 
the estimated royalty rate used was based on existing lycos contracts for the licensing of similar technologies 
guestworld and wisewire are both development stage companies that had not generated significant commercial revenue at their respective acquisition dates and were loss making 
neither company had completed development of technologically robust or commercially viable products or services 
significant uncertainty existed in relation to the introduction of such products or services 
lycos management has considered the possible existence or value of other intangible assets such as patents  copyrights  brand names  customers lists  etc 
however  management at both companies had been focused on completing the development projects underway and they had not undertaken the development of other intangible assets 
accordingly  lycos management believes that the value of any other such assets at the respective acquisition dates to be minimal or zero 
the purchase price paid for guestworld and wisewire reflected payment for incomplete technology 
should the in process projects fail  the value of lycos investment in these incomplete technologies would be diminimous or zero 
in the case of tripod  management does believe that other intangible assets had been created by management at the acquisition date 
as a result  in addition to valuing in process research and development  management has also allocated a proportion of the purchase price  based on their respective fair values  to existing technology employed in the creation and management of pods as well as to other intangible assets associated with the existing community members 
as a result of this analysis  the company expensed approximately million representing purchased in process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use

factors affecting the company s business  operating results and financial condition the following risk factors should be considered in conjunction with the other information included in this report 
this report including the documents incorporated by reference herein may include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition to those risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the company identifies the following risk factors which could affect the company s actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
limited operating history  anticipation of continued losses 
the company was founded in june and for the years ended july  and generated revenues of million and million  respectively 
accordingly  the company has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
the company and its prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include the company s ability to continue to develop and extend the lycos brand  the company s ability to maintain premier positions on high traffic web access points such as its arrangements with netscape communications corp 
netscape and microsoft corporation microsoft or to enter into additional distribution relationships and strategic alliances  the ability of the company to maintain and increase levels of traffic on its websites  the ability of the company to continue to develop or acquire content  features and functionality for its services  the development of equal or superior services or products by competitors  the failure of the market to adopt the web as an advertising or commercial medium  the reduction in market prices for web based advertising as a result of competition or otherwise  the company s ability to effectively generate commerce related revenues through sponsored services and placements in lycos services  and the company s success in attracting  retaining and motivating qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the limited operating history of the company makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult or impossible  and therefore  the recent revenue growth experienced by the company should not be taken as indicative of the rate of growth  if any  that can be expected in the future 
the company has incurred significant losses since inception 
the company reported a loss of per share a loss per share before amortization and one time acquisition related charges for the year ended july  and there can be no assurance that the company will sustain revenue growth or return to profitability in the future 
as of july   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
as a result of the company s limited operating history  the company does not have historical financial data for any significant period of time on which to base planned operating expenses 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a certain extent are fixed 
quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on the advertising  electronic commerce  license fees and other revenues received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
because the company s expense levels are based upon anticipated advertising  electronic commerce and licensing revenue  the company may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in relation to the company s expectations would have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company plans to significantly increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  increase its sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  broaden its customer support capabilities  maintain brand identity and pursue strategic alliances 
in the future  leading websites  browser providers and other distribution channels may require payments or other consideration in exchange for providing access to the company s products and services  such as the company s agreements with netscape and microsoft 
additionally  the company may incur costs pertaining to the introduction or enhancement of services offered by the company or the acquisition of businesses or technologies 
to the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
these factors include general economic conditions  specific economic conditions in the internet industry  usage of the internet  the level of traffic to the company s websites  demand for internet advertising and electronic commerce  the addition or loss of advertisers or electronic commerce sponsors  seasonal trends in advertising sales  the advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  incurrence of costs relating to acquisitions  the introduction of new products or services by the company or its competitors  the mix of the services sold  the channels through which those services are sold  and pricing changes 
as a strategic response to a changing competitive environment  the company may elect from time to time to make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the nascent nature of the internet industry  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon for an indication of future performance 
the company also has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonality in its business  with user traffic on the company s websites and the websites of its partners being lower during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods  when usage of the web and the company s services has typically declined 
due to all of the foregoing factors and others that the company cannot predict  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on advertising revenues  risks related to sponsorships 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of advertisements on its web pages 
for the fiscal year ended july   advertising revenues represented approximately of the company s total revenues 
the company s strategy is to continue to develop advertising and other methods of generating revenues through the use of its products and services 
the company s ability to increase its advertising revenues will depend  among other things  on advertisers acceptance of the internet as an attractive and sustainable medium  the development of a large base of users of the company s products and services possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  the expansion of the company s advertising sales force and the development of the internet as an attractive platform for electronic commerce 
in addition  there is fluid and intense competition in the sale of advertising on the internet  resulting in a wide range of rates quoted and a variety of pricing models offered by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  which makes it difficult to project future levels of advertising revenues that will be realized generally or by any specific company 
it is also difficult to predict which pricing models will be adopted by the industry or advertisers 
for example  advertising rates based on the number of click throughs from the company s network to advertisers pages  instead of rates based solely on the number of impressions  could materially adversely affect the company s revenues 
in addition  filter software programs that limit or remove advertising from the web user s desktop are available 
the widespread adoption of such software by users could have a material adverse effect on the viability of advertising on the web 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating significant future advertising revenues  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  significant and consistent investment on the internet by many advertisers is dependent upon validation that the internet is an effective advertising medium  which validation has not yet occurred and which is essential to the achievement of steady and predictable advertising revenues

the company has entered into sponsorship arrangements with third parties to provide sponsored services and placements on the company s websites in addition to traditional banner advertising 
in connection with these arrangements  the company may receive sponsorship fees as well as a portion of transaction revenues received by such third party sponsors from users originated through the company s websites  in return for minimum levels of user impressions or click throughs to be provided by the company 
to the extent implemented  these arrangements expose the company to potentially significant financial risks  including the risk that the company fails to deliver required minimum levels of user impressions or click throughs in which case  these agreements typically provide for adjustments to the fees payable thereunder or make good periods and that third party sponsors do not renew the agreements at the end of their terms 
certain of these arrangements also require the company to integrate sponsors content with the company s services  which requires the dedication of resources and significant programming and design efforts to accomplish 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract additional sponsors or that it will be able to renew existing sponsorship arrangements when they expire 
in addition  the company has granted exclusivity provisions to certain of its sponsors  and may in the future grant additional exclusivity provisions 
such exclusivity provisions may have the effect of preventing the company  for the duration of such exclusivity arrangements  from accepting advertising or sponsorship arrangements within a particular subject matter in the company s websites or across the company s entire service 
the inability of the company to enter into further sponsorship or advertising arrangements as a result of its exclusivity arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business advertising and electronic commerce 
the internet as a commercial endeavor has been in existence for a short period of time 
the costs of establishing a website are low  and new online service providers  content providers and advertisers are being launched regularly 
many of these companies are funded with venture capital and other forms of financing before they have proven both that their particular industry segment and their business strategy will be successful 
those companies that are unable to prove themselves successful before their initial funding is depleted may find it difficult or impossible to secure additional funding 
the failure of any of the company s advertisers or electronic commerce sponsors to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on netscape  microsoft and other third party relationships 
the company is dependent on a number of third party relationships  including its relationships with netscape and microsoft  to create traffic on the company s websites and consequently generate revenues 
these relationships include arrangements relating to the positioning of the company s products and services on web browsers such as those offered by netscape and microsoft  and on other sites through license agreements in which internet sites are linked to or otherwise utilize the company s services 
for the fiscal year ended july   a material portion of the traffic to the company s websites was derived through the netscape and microsoft browsers 
in may  the company renewed its one year premier provider agreement with netscape the netscape agreement pursuant to which the company is designated as a premier provider of search and navigation services accessible from the net search button on the netscape browser through may  under the terms of the netscape agreement  netscape will commit of its search exposures during the one year term of the netscape agreement to the company s search services 
in september  the company signed a one year agreement with microsoft the microsoft agreement pursuant to which the company is designated as a premium provider of search services on the microsoft start page and from the search buttons imbedded in the internet explorer broswer 
because netscape and microsoft provide only exposures from their respective services as compared to a number of users who click through to the company s websites  there can be no assurance that the netscape agreement and microsoft agreement will provide the company s websites with material amounts of traffic 
netscape has recently announced a two year agreement with excite  inc in which netscape will commit an aggregate of of its search exposures during the first year of the agreement to excite s search services and netscape s own branded search service which will be powered by excite and netscape will commit an aggregate of of its search exposures during the second year of the agreement to netscape s branded search service and excite s search services 
this agreement will limit the number of search exposures which netscape may make available to other providers of search services  including the company  in the future 
although each of the netscape agreement and microsoft agreement may only be terminated under certain limited circumstances  if the company were unable to continue as a premier provider for either netscape or microsoft  the company s websites could lose a material portion of their traffic  traffic on competing services could substantially increase  and the company s websites could otherwise become less attractive to advertisers  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a traffic reduction could  in turn  result in advertisers on the company s websites  including sponsors and partners  terminating their contracts with the company  as such contracts are typically of short duration and terminable on relatively short notice  or reducing the number of impressions purchased 
furthermore  the company s contracts with advertisers and sponsors generally guarantee a minimum number of page views  and a failure to achieve the minimum page views could result in a reduction in payments to the company or compel the company to provide make good impressions if such minimums are not met 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with third parties to create traffic on the company s websites or is otherwise unable to offset a reduction in traffic  advertising revenues would be materially adversely affected  resulting in a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business strategic alliances 
the company is also dependent on website operators that provide links to the company s websites and  for certain elements of the company s properties  the company licenses technology and related databases from third parties  including telephone directories  e mail  chat  street mapping and other similar services 
the company believes that certain of its third party relationships are important to its ability to attract traffic and advertisers 
any errors  failures or delays experienced in connection with these third party technologies and information services could alienate the company s users and adversely affect the company s brand and its business 
although the company views these relationships as important direct and indirect factors in the generation of revenues  most of the company s arrangements do not include minimum commitments to use the company s services or to provide access or links to the company s products or services in the future  are not exclusive and generally have a term of only one to three years 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s partners regard their relationship with the company as important to their own respective businesses and operations  that they will not reassess their commitment to the company s products or services at any time in the future  or that they will not develop their own competitive products or services 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenues for the company 
failure of one or more of the company s partnering relationships to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success  or the termination of one or more successful partnering relationships  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the termination of the company s position on a web browser  or the grant to a competitor of an exclusive arrangement with respect to positioning on a web browser  would significantly reduce traffic on the company s websites  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition 
the market for internet products and services is highly competitive 
in addition  the market for internet advertising and electronic commerce arrangements is intensely competitive and the company expects that competition will continue to intensify 
although the company believes that the diverse segments of the internet market will provide opportunities for more than one supplier of products and services similar to those of the company  it is possible that a single supplier may dominate one or more market segments 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market are name recognition  distribution arrangements  performance  ease of use  a variety of value added services  functionality and features  and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of the company s target markets 
the primary competitors of the company s products and services are other companies providing online services  including america online including compuserve  compaq s alta vista  excite inc including webcrawler  infoseek corporation  microsoft s start  netscape s netcenter  prodigy services  inc  snap and yahoo inc 
in addition  a number of companies offering internet products and services  including direct competitors of the company  recently have begun to integrate multiple features within the products and services they offer to consumers 
integration of internet products and services is occurring through development of competing products and through acquisitions of  or entering into joint ventures and or licensing arrangements involving  competitors of the company 
for example  the web browsers offered by netscape and microsoft  which are the two most widely used browsers and substantial sources of traffic for the company  may incorporate and promote information search and retrieval capabilities in future releases or upgrades that could make it more difficult for internet viewers to find and use the company s products and services 
microsoft recently licensed products and services from inktomi corporation inktomi  a direct competitor of the company  and has announced that it will feature and promote inktomi services in the microsoft network and other microsoft online properties 
the company expects that such search services may be tightly integrated into the microsoft operating system  the internet explorer browser  and other software applications  and that microsoft will promote such services within the microsoft network or through other microsoft affiliated end user services such as msnbc or webtv networks  inc in addition  many large media companies have announced that they are contemplating developing or acquiring internet navigation services and are attempting to become gateway sites for web users 
in the event these companies develop such portal sites  the company could lose a substantial portion of its user traffic  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  entities that sponsor or maintain high traffic websites or that provide an initial point of entry for internet viewers  such as the regional bell operating companies or internet service providers isps such as america online  inc and prodigy services  inc  currently offer and can be expected to consider further development  acquisition or licensing of internet search and navigation functions competitive with those offered by the company  or could take actions that make it more difficult for viewers to find and use the company s products and services 
consolidations  integration and strategic relationships involving competitors of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also competes with metasearch services that allow a user to search the databases of several catalogs and directories simultaneously 
the company also competes indirectly with database vendors that offer information search and retrieval capabilities with their core database products 
tripod and angelfire compete with other community based websites  including geocities  inc in the future  the company may encounter competition from providers of web browser software and other internet products and services that incorporate search and retrieval features into their offerings 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not offer internet products and services that are superior to those of the company or that achieve greater market acceptance than the company s offerings 
moreover  a number of the company s current advertising customers and partners have established relationships with certain of the company s competitors  and future advertising customers and partners may establish similar relationships 
the company competes with online services and other website operators as well as traditional off line media  such as print and television  for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

risks associated with brand development 
the company believes that establishing and maintaining the lycos network brand is a crucial aspect of its efforts to continue to expand and attract its internet audience and that the importance of brand recognition will increase in the future due to the growing number of internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry 
promotion and enhancement of the lycos network brand will depend largely on the company s ability to provide consistently high quality products and services  which cannot be assured 
if consumers do not perceive the company s existing products and services to be of high quality  or if the company introduces new products and services or enters into new business ventures that are not favorably received by consumers  the company will be unsuccessful in promoting and maintaining its brand  and will risk diluting its brand and decreasing the attractiveness of its audiences to advertisers 
developing market  unproven acceptance of the company s products and services  uncertain adoption of the internet as an advertising medium 
the market for the company s products and services has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products and services for use on the internet 
the company s market is highly dependent upon the increased use of the internet for information publication and distribution  commerce  and on the development of the internet as an advertising medium 
the company s future operating results will depend upon the growth of the internet advertising and commerce markets  the successful implementation of the company s advertising program and the company s ability to establish electronic commerce and licensing relationships and other strategic alliances 
there can be no assurance  however  that the internet advertising or commerce market will develop as an attractive and sustainable medium  that the company will achieve or sustain market acceptance of its products and services or that the company will be able to execute its business plan successfully 
as is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the industry is young and has few proven products 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access  quality of service and acceptance of advertising and electronic commerce remain unresolved and may impact the growth of the internet  or the placement of advertisements on the internet or the growth of the internet as a means of electronic commerce 
if commercial use of the internet does not grow  if the internet does not develop as an attractive medium for advertising or electronic commerce  or if the internet infrastructure does not effectively support growth that may occur  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 
because the market for the company s products and services is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market and growth rate  if any 
there can be no assurance that the market for the company s products and services will develop or that demand for the company s products or services will emerge or become sustainable 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 
see business strategy 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and investments 
the company has completed  and may in the future pursue  acquisitions of companies  technologies or assets that complement the company s business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate any acquired business including tripod  wisewire  guestworld  whowhere and wired into the company s operations 
acquisitions may result in the potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the write off of in process research and development or software acquisition and development costs  and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  for the year ended july   the company recorded an in process research and development expense of approximately million and goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million in connection with the acquisitions of tripod  wisewire and guestworld 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development used by the company in making its determination as to the amount of in process research and development expense was supported by valuation studies prepared by an independent third party appraiser 
in september  a representative of the securities and exchange commission the sec provided the american institute of certified public accountants with quidance as to the factors to be considered in the valuation of in process research and development 
although the company believes that the amount of the recorded in process research and development expense is reasonable when applying these factors  there can be no assurance that the sec will not review the company s valuations  which review could result in the company making adjustments to the reported amounts of in process research and development expense for the year ended july  any such adjustment could result in an increase in the amount of goodwill recorded with respect to the acquisition of tripod  wisewire or guestworld  which would result in higher amortization expenses and  therefore  adversely affect the company s future operating results 
acquisitions would involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns along with the risks involved in entering markets in which the company has little or no experience 
problems with an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the company 
the company has made  and may in the future make  investments in companies involved in the development of technologies or services that are complementary or related to the company s operations 
the company has recently made investments in companies that are in an early stage of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
there can be no assurance that any investments in such companies will result in any return  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any such return  or that the company will not suffer the loss of its entire investment

management of growth  need to establish infrastructure  additional personnel 
the rapid execution necessary for the company to successfully offer its products and services and implement its business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
the company s rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial and operational resources 
to manage its growth  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
further  the company will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion and transition  that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  or that the company s management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to offer successfully the company s products and services and implement its business plan 
the company s future operating results will also depend on many factors  including its ability to expand its advertising sales and business development organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the growth of its business 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
see item a executive officers of the registrant 
risks associated with international expansion 
international sales  primarily from licensing the company s products and services  accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended july  as part of its business strategy  the company is seeking opportunities to expand its products and services into international markets 
in this regard  in may  the company formed lycos bertelsmann gmbh co 
kg in conjunction with bertelsmann ag to offer lycos search services in europe  and in march  the company entered into a joint venture with sumitomo corp 
and internet initiative japan  inc iij to offer search services in japan 
the company believes that this expansion is important to the company s ability to continue to grow and to market its products and services 
in marketing its products and services internationally  however  the company will face new competitors 
in addition  the ability of the company to enter international markets will be dependent upon the company s ability to create localized versions of its products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in creating localized versions of its products and services  marketing or distributing its products abroad or that  if the company is successful  its international revenues will be adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining international operations 
to date  the company has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally 
in addition to the uncertainty as to the company s ability to establish an international presence  there are certain difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as compliance with regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements  export restrictions  export controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  protection of intellectual property rights  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on any international operations established by the company and  consequently  on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements 
dependence on the internet 
the use of the company s products and services will depend in large part upon the development by others of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
because global commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks are new and evolving  it is difficult to predict with any certainty whether the internet will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including lack of acceptable security technologies  potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development and commercialization of performance improvements  including high speed modems 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it by such potential growth or that the performance or reliability of the web will not be adversely affected by this continued growth 
in addition  the internet could lose its commercial viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols for example  the next generation internet protocol to handle increased levels of internet activity 
there can be no assurance that the infrastructure or complementary services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace will be developed or  if developed  that the internet will become a viable commercial marketplace for products and services such as those offered by the company 
in particular  the internet has only recently become a medium for advertising and electronic commerce 
if the necessary infrastructure or complementary services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace or platform for advertising and electronic commerce  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
risk of capacity constraints and system failure  advertising management system 
a key element of the company s strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic to its products and services  which the company makes available free of charge to users of the internet 
accordingly  the performance of the company s products and services is critical to the company s reputation  its ability to attract advertisers to the company s websites and the market acceptance of these products and services 
any system failure that causes interruptions in the availability  or increases response time  of the company s products and services could result in less traffic to the company s websites and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of the company s products and services to advertisers and partners 
an increase in the volume of searches conducted through the company s products and services could strain the capacity of the software or hardware deployed by the company or the capacity of the company s network infrastructure  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
any failure to expand the capacity of the company s hardware or network infrastructure on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  as the number of web pages and users increases  there can be no assurance that the company s products and services will be able to scale proportionately 
the company is dependent upon web browsers and internet and online service providers for access to its products and services  and users have experienced difficulties due to browser and provider system failures unrelated to the company s systems  products and services 
the company is also dependent on hardware suppliers for prompt delivery  installation and service of servers and other equipment and services used to provide its products and services 
substantially all of the company s hardware operations are located at its computer facility located in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and the santa clara  california and waltham  massachusetts sites of exodus communications  inc the company also outsources a portion of its hardware operations to third parties 
there can be no assurance that a system failure at any of these locations would not adversely affect the performance of the company s products and services 
this system is vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
the company does not presently have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan 
despite the implementation of network security measures by the company  its servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems 
computer viruses  break ins or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to users of the company s products and services 
the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business properties 
the process of managing advertising within large  high traffic websites such as the company s is an increasingly important and complex task 
the company licenses from a third party an advertising management system 
to the extent that the company encounters system failures or material difficulties in the operation of this system  the company could be unable to deliver banner advertisements and sponsorships through its websites 
any extended failure of  or material difficulties encountered in connection with  the company s advertising management system may expose the company to make good obligations with its advertising customers  which  by displacing advertising inventory  among other consequences  would reduce revenue and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

technological change and new products 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and customer demands  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
these market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of this market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products in the near future 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of the lycos search and navigation services in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful 
in addition  a key element of the company s business strategy is the development  introduction and integration of new products that capitalize on the increasing use of the internet 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or integrating such products or services or that such products and services will meet with market acceptance 
in addition  new product releases by the company may contain undetected errors that require significant design modifications  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and viewer support  which will adversely affect the use of the company s products and services and  consequently  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business strategy and technology  intellectual property and property rights 
intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology 
the company currently relies on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and with its consultants and partners 
the company has registered and applied for registration of certain service marks and trademarks  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks  as appropriate 
in addition  carnegie mellon university cmu has been issued a patent in the united states relating to lycos search and indexing technology  which has been licensed to the company on a perpetual basis 
there can be no assurance that such patent will not be challenged  and if such challenges are brought  that the patent will not be invalidated 
there also can be no assurance that the company will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide the company with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or services or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and the company does not currently have any patents or patent applications pending in any foreign country 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology or duplicate the company s products or design around patents issued to the company or other intellectual property rights of the company 
there have been substantial amounts of litigation in the computer industry regarding intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not in the future claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products  trademarks or other proprietary rights  that the company will counterclaim against any such parties in such actions or that if the company makes claims against third parties with respect thereto  that any such party will not counterclaim against the company in such actions 
any such claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention  cause product release delays  require the company to redesign its products or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
see business technology  intellectual property and proprietary rights 
government regulation and legal uncertainties 
the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the web 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the web  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the web  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the web  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s services and products or increase the company s cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that  although transmission of the company s services originate from its operations centers in new jersey  pennsylvania  massachusetts and california the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or prosecute the company for violations of their laws 
there can be no assurance that violations of local laws will not be alleged or charged by state or foreign governments  that the company might not unintentionally violate such law or that such laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
it is also possible that states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales taxes on out of state companies that engage in commerce over the internet 
in the event that states or foreign countries succeed in imposing sales or other taxes on internet commerce  the growth of the use of the internet for commerce could slow substantially 
any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees  all of whom have worked together for only a short period of time 
the company does not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company is heavily dependent upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate skilled technical and managerial personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  hire  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability to attract  hire  assimilate or retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
see item a executive officers of the registrant 
liability for information retrieved from the internet 
because material may be downloaded by the online or internet services operated or facilitated by the company or the internet access providers with which the company has relationships  and be subsequently distributed to others  it is possible that claims will be made against the company on the basis of defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of such materials  including claims based on the company providing access to obscene  lascivious or indecent information 
although the company carries general liability insurance  the company s insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  or may not be adequate to indemnify the company for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
the price of the company s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in results of operations  announcements of new technological innovations or new products and media properties by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to the company  and news relating to trends in the company s markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  regardless of the company s operating performance

year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
these date code fields will need to distinguish st century dates from th century dates and  as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
state of readiness 
the company is in the process of evaluating the year readiness of the hardware and software products sold by the company products  the information technology systems used in its operations it systems  and its non it systems  such as building security  voice mail and other systems 
the company currently anticipates that the project will cover the following phases i identification of all products  it systems  and non it systems  ii assessment of repair or replacement requirements  iii repair or replacement  iv testing  v implementation  and vi creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
the company has completed its assessment of all current versions of its products and believes they are year compliant 
even so  the assessment of whether a complete system or device in which a product is embedded will operate correctly for an end user depends in large part on the year compliance of the system s other components  most of which are supplied by parties other than the company 
the supplier of the company s current financial and accounting software has informed the company that such software is year compliant 
further  the company relies  both domestically and internationally  upon various vendors  governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunications service companies  delivery service companies and other service providers who are outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that such parties will not suffer a year business disruption  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
during the first half of fiscal  the company intends to i conduct an internal review of the year compliance of all prior versions of its products and ii circulate a questionnaire to vendors and customers with whom the company has material relationships to obtain information about their year compliance 
until such information is obtained  the company will not be able to effectively evaluate whether any remediation efforts will be required with respect to its it systems except as described above  non it systems or prior versions of its products 
costs
