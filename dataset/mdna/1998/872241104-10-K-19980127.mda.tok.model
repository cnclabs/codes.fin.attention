year impact during the fiscal year ended october   the company began a process to identify and address issues surrounding the year and its impact on the company s computer operations 
the issue surrounding the year is whether the company s computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to  or systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
as the company has not completed their initial assessment of the impact the year may have on their computer operations  management can not estimate the costs associated with ensuring the company s systems are year compliant 
although the company is in the initial phases of determining the impact of the year  management anticipates completion of the project by january  allowing adequate time for testing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s systems nor the computer systems of other companies with whom the company conducts business will be year compliant prior to december  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
inflation the net impact of inflation on operations has not been material in the last three years due to the relatively low rates of inflation during this period 
if the rate of inflation increases the company may increase customer rates to keep pace with the increase in inflation  although there may be timing delays
