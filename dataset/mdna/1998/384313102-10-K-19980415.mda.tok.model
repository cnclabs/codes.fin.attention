item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background 
in  ucar international inc ucar and  together with its subsidiaries  the company consummated a leveraged recapitalization the recapitalization  an initial public offering the initial offering  a redemption the redemption of a portion of the subordinated notes the subordinated notes issued in connection with the recapitalization and a refinancing of the senior bank credit facilities established in connection with the recapitalization the refinancing 
in  the company also acquired substantially all of the shares of its brazilian subsidiary owned by public shareholders in brazil 
recent events 
in  the company acquired of the equity of ucar grafit oao ucar grafit 
thereafter  the company increased its ownership to at december  of such equity 
in  the company acquired of the equity of carbone savoie sas carbone savoie and  through a newly formed owned subsidiary  ucar elektroden gmbh ucar elektroden  acquired the graphite electrode business of elektrokohle lichtenberg ag ekl in berlin  germany 
the company also acquired the outstanding shares of emsa pty 
ltd 
emsa held by the company s former joint venture partner in emsa 
the acquisitions of ucar grafit  carbone savoie  emsa and the graphite electrode business of ekl collectively  the acquired companies were accounted for as purchases the company currently has no plans to make any further acquisitions in the near term 
in  ucar s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of common stock at prevailing prices from time to time in the open market or otherwise depending on market conditions and other factors  without any established minimum or maximum time period or number of shares 
through december   ucar purchased an aggregate of million of common stock under such program including  shares repurchased for million concurrently with a secondary public offering of common stock by stockholders affiliated with blackstone capital partners ii merchant banking fund lp and its affiliates collectively blackstone 
ucar does not currently expect to continue to repurchase common stock under this program 
in addition  on december   ucar s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of the outstanding performance stock options associated with performance targets 
in  western europe began to recover from the economic downturn that commenced in in addition  an economic downturn in the asia pacific region began in which is still continuing 
although the company is a global company  its exposure in the asia pacific region approximates of total net sales 
the company believes its net sales to asia pacific region customers will  at least during the first half of  be negatively impacted as a result of the decline in such region s steel production rates and the resultant delay in such customers orders for graphite electrodes 
the company serves every geographic market worldwide and  accordingly  it is always impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as country or regional market conditions fluctuate 
in  the company was served with subpoenas  search warrants and information requests by antitrust authorities in the united states and the european union in connection with investigations as to whether there has been any violation of antitrust laws by producers of graphite electrodes 
subsequently  several antitrust class action civil lawsuits were commenced against ucar and certain other producers of graphite electrodes in the united states 
these lawsuits have been consolidated into a single lawsuit  although additional similar lawsuits have been subsequently commenced 
as a result of recent developments  the company recorded a charge against results of operations for in the amount of million million after tax for estimated potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
although the million charge represents the company s best estimate as to the amount of such potential liabilities and expenses as of the date of filing this annual report on form k with the commission  actual liabilities and expenses could be materially higher or lower than such estimate 
ucar has also been named as a defendant in a shareholder derivative lawsuit and a securities class action lawsuit  each of which is based  in part on the subject matter of such antitrust investigations 
it is possible that additional antitrust civil lawsuits seeking  among other things  to recover damages could be commenced against the company in the united states and in other jurisdictions 
it is also possible that antitrust investigations in other jurisdictions could be commenced 
in april  pursuant to an agreement with the doj  ucar agreed to plead guilty to a one count charge of violating antitrust laws in the sale of graphite electrodes 
additionally  ucar agreed to pay a non interest bearing fine in the aggregate amount of million  payable in six annual installments 
under the plea agreement  ucar will not be subject to prosecution by the doj with respect to any antitrust violations occurring prior to the date on which the agreement receives court approval 
the fine payable pursuant to the plea agreement is within the amounts used by the company for purposes of determining the million charge 
the plea agreement has been submitted for court approval 
although ucar does not expect such an outcome  it is possible that the court could reject the plea agreement 
in such event  ucar would be required to either defend any charges which could be brought or enter into a less favorable plea agreement 
regardless of whether the plea agreement is accepted by the court  the plea agreement makes it more difficult to defend against antitrust civil lawsuits 
in addition  due to the fact such lawsuits are in the earliest stages and no evaluation of liability can yet be made  no amounts have been accrued with respect to the shareholder derivative and securities fraud class action lawsuits 
currency matters 
the company sells its products in multiple currencies but seeks to price its products based on us dollar equivalent target prices for each country or regional market 
these target prices are based on evaluations of the relevant exchange rates  the relationship between all of the target prices and other factors  if any  which the company may deem appropriate 
each subsidiary then seeks to institute price increases to achieve target prices when  as and if local conditions permit 
a subsidiary may rescind a price increase or grant price discounts if required by local conditions 
the impact on net sales of any price increase in foreign countries can be mitigated or exaggerated by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company has entered into hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
while most of the company s sales are made to customers in markets where local currencies are readily convertible into us dollars  the company makes sales to customers in other markets  particularly countries in the former soviet union  eastern europe  the middle east and the asia pacific region 
when the company deems it appropriate  the terms of sale to customers in these markets require payment in us dollars  deutsche marks or yen and may additionally require prepayment or delivery of a bank letter of credit or equivalent security for payment

the company s raw material sales were reduced by million in net sales of the company s products outside the united states accounted for of total net sales in and of total net sales in net sales of graphite electrodes accounted for of total net sales in as compared to of total net sales in excluding the acquired companies  the volume of graphite electrodes sold increased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in from  metric tons in  which added million of net sales in this increase in the volume of graphite electrodes sold was primarily due to the economic recovery in western europe  including purchases by certain customers in advance of announced price increases effective january   or customer buy ins  and increased export shipments to the asia pacific and middle east regions 
excluding the acquired companies  increases in the average selling price in us dollars and net of changes in currency exchange rates of graphite electrodes added approximately million to net sales in the western european currencies weakened considerably in against the us dollar 
accordingly  these price increases were more than offset by the negative impact of currency translation on net sales of graphite electrodes  which amounted to approximately million 
the non graphite electrode businesses  excluding the acquired companies  remained relatively stable on a combined basis in as compared to gross profit in was million of net sales  a increase over the gross profit of million of net sales in excluding the acquired companies  the gross margin would have been in  an improvement of basis points over the improvement resulted primarily from an increase in capacity utilization and cost savings  partially offset by increases in the cost of raw materials

excluding the million charge and the acquired companies  operating profit in would have been million of net sales in selling  administrative and other expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in selling  administrative and other expenses in included the million non cash charge for the vesting of outstanding performance stock options 
additionally  the acquired companies had selling  administrative and other expenses amounting to million in other income expense net was expense of million in as compared to income of million in the change resulted primarily from million of consulting fees associated with projects that the company is undertaking to further improve operating efficiency  integrate worldwide operations and generate earnings growth 
interest expense increased to million in from million in in  the average outstanding total debt balance was million and the average annual interest rate was as compared to an average outstanding total debt balance of million and an average annual interest rate of in the decline in the average annual interest rate is primarily attributable to decreases in interest rates resulting from the amendment of the company s senior bank credit facilities the senior bank facilities in march the increase in outstanding debt resulted primarily from million of investments in acquisitions  million for repurchase of common stock and million for capital expenditures  offset by net cash flow from operations of million 
provision for income taxes was million in as compared to million in in  the provision for income taxes was significantly higher than the amount computed by applying the united states federal income tax rate primarily due to the fact that a majority of the charge in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims will not be deductible  offset to a much lesser extent by the company s tax exemption in brazil  tax credits in the united states associated with research and development expenses and tax benefits recognized in italy and spain associated with capital expenditures and fixed asset revaluations  respectively 
ucar s share of net income from its company carried at equity  emsa  was million during the period from january  to april  as compared to million for all of in april  the company acquired the outstanding shares of emsa held by its former joint venture partner 
following the acquisition  emsa s results of operations were consolidated with the company s results of operations and no additional equity income was recorded

the graphite specialties business had increased volume in superfine grain products  which are used in the semiconductor industry  and increased volume in graphite cathodes  which are used in the aluminum industry 
net sales of the company s core graphite electrodes business  which accounted for of total net sales in  increased approximately to million in as compared to million in the average selling price in us dollars and net of changes in currency exchange rates of graphite electrodes sold increased approximately to  per metric ton in as compared to  per metric ton in the volume of graphite electrodes sold in declined by approximately in as compared to graphite electrode sales volume in western europe declined in as compared to as a result of lower economic activity as members of the european union continued to work toward a unified monetary system

restructuring costs of million were incurred in in connection with the rationalization project 
no restructuring costs were incurred in other income expense net was income of million in as compared to expense of million in the change resulted primarily from a million decrease in interest income primarily due to a reduction in short term investments by the company s brazilian subsidiary  a million reduction in expense from foreign currency adjustments including reduced translation losses from brazilian operations and us dollar denominated debt of the company s foreign subsidiaries and a non recurring expense of million associated with bank fees due to the recapitalization which were incurred in but not in interest expense decreased to million in from million in in  the average outstanding total debt balance was million and the average annual interest rate was as compared to an average outstanding total debt balance of million and an average annual interest rate of in provision for income taxes was million in as compared to million in in  income tax expense was higher than the amount computed by applying the united states federal income tax rate primarily due to non recurring taxes of approximately million associated with the recapitalization 
minority stockholders share of income of the company s brazilian subsidiary decreased to million in from million in due to an increase in the company s ownership of that subsidiary 
substantially all of the minority interest of the brazilian subsidiary was purchased by the company in the company s share of net income of emsa remained stable at million in and the following table sets forth a summary of the results of operations for  as adjusted for certain non recurring expenses  taxes and costs operating net profit income dollars in millions  except per share data as reported in the consolidated financial statements non recurring expenses  taxes and costs compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of performance stock options and restricted matching stock in connection with the initial offering senior subordinated credit facility expense and long term incentive compensation plan payments in connection with the recapitalization extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt taxes associated with the recapitalization pro forma interest adjustment to give effect to the recapitalization  the initial offering  the redemption and the refinancing as if they occurred on january  pro forma operating profit net income effects of inflation in general  the company s cost of sales is affected by the inflation in each country in which it has a manufacturing facility 
during the past three years  the effects of inflation in the united states and foreign countries except for highly inflationary countries have been offset by a combination of improved operating efficiency  improved pricing and permanent  on going cost savings and  accordingly  have not been material to the company 
the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by the company  and natural gas  which is used by the company in its electrode  cathode and graphite specialties baking operations  may fluctuate widely for various reasons  including fuel shortages and cold weather 
changes in such costs were not material to the company during the three years ended december  no assurance can be given that future increases in the company s cost of sales or other expenses will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts by which the company is able to increase its prices 
the company maintains operations in brazil and russia  countries which historically have had highly inflationary economies 
the financial statements of these foreign operations have been remeasured as if the respective functional currencies of the brazilian and russian economic environments were the us dollar 
accordingly  translation gains and losses were included in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the company also maintains operations in mexico 
because of significant increases in the rate of inflation in mexico  mexico is considered to have a highly inflationary economy and  effective january   the company changed its functional currency in mexico to the us dollar 
effective january   brazil is no longer considered to be a highly inflationary economy 
if this change had occurred effective january   the effect on results of operations and financial condition would not have been material 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates the company produces and sells its products in multiple currencies 
in general  the company s results of operations are affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
when the local currencies of foreign countries in which the company has a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by the company  which is denominated in us dollars 
the company prices products manufactured at such facilities in local currencies and adjusts those prices to the extent permitted by local market conditions to attempt to maintain a us dollar equivalent target price 
accordingly  when the local currencies increase or decline in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
net sales of graphite electrodes were approximately million  or  lower in as a result of the impact of negative currency translation 
the western european currencies weakened considerably in against the us dollar 
in an effort to mitigate the effects of exchange rate changes  price increases were announced in certain of the western european countries which became effective on january  during  the currencies in many of the countries in which the company sells its products have continued to weaken against the us dollar 
the company believes that it is likely that such exchange rate changes will adversely affect its net sales despite its efforts to mitigate the effects of such changes 
to further manage exposure to general economic and specific financial market risks caused by currency exchange rate changes  the company engages in hedging activities and uses various off balance sheet financial instruments 
the amount of currency exchange contracts used by the company to minimize these risks was million at december   million at december  and million at december  in connection with the recapitalization  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries borrowed million of us dollar denominated debt 
in november  the company repatriated us dollar denominated debt of its mexican subsidiary by replacing it with debt of ucar global enterprises inc global 
at december   total outstanding us dollar denominated debt of the company s foreign subsidiaries excluding the company s subsidiaries in russia and brazil  which used the us dollar as their functional currency because they operate in highly inflationary economies was million 
changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies in the countries in which these subsidiaries are located result in foreign currency gains and losses that are reported in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations 
while changes in currency exchange rates did not materially affect the company in the three years ended december   there can be no assurance that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
since november  the company s foreign subsidiaries with us dollar denominated debt have entered into foreign currency contracts to protect against exchange rate changes 
the amount of such contracts was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the company believes that the repatriation of the us dollar denominated debt from its mexican subsidiary and such contracts reduce the company s exposure to exchange rate changes related to such borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt financing 
the company s uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of debt reduction including the redemption with proceeds from the initial offering  capital expenditures  distributions to stockholders including repurchases of common equity  acquisition of controlling interests in new companies or businesses and acquisition of minority stockholders shares of consolidated subsidiaries 
since  acquisitions and repurchases under ucar s stock repurchase program have been financed from existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  short term borrowings and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
general effects of indebtedness and liabilities 
the company is highly leveraged 
the company s indebtedness is expected to increase and its liquidity is expected to decrease in connection with liabilities arising out of antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
at december   the company had an aggregate of million of outstanding indebtedness and a stockholders deficit of million as compared to million of outstanding indebtedness and a stockholders deficit of million at december  the company s substantial indebtedness and obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims could have important consequences  including the following i the company s ability to restructure its existing debt or obtain additional debt financing for working capital  capital expenditures  settlements  judgments or other obligations in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims  or general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service obligations and obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  thereby reducing the funds available to the company for other purposes  iii the company may be substantially more leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place the company at a competitive disadvantage  iv the company s substantial degree of leverage may hinder its ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or other events  and v the company s substantial degree of leverage makes it more vulnerable to insolvency  bankruptcy or other adverse effects in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or its business or in the event that obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims are greater than expected 
the company s ability to service its debt and meet its other obligations  including obligations associated with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  as they come due will depend on its future financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to  among other things  changes in the graphite and carbon industry  prevailing economic conditions and certain financial  business and other factors beyond its control  including interest rates 
the company believes that obligations associated with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims has had a material adverse impact on its working capital  and will have a material adverse impact on its cash flow and liquidity 
if the company s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to enable the company to meet its debt service and other obligations as they become due  the failure to meet such obligations could have a material adverse effect on the company  up to and including bankruptcy 
cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
for at least the past five years  the company has had positive annual cash flow from operations 
typically  the first quarter of each year results in neutral or negative cash flow from operations after deducting cash used for capital expenditures due to various factors 
these factors include interest payments on the subordinated notes  rebuilding inventory levels related to the effect of customer buy ins in the fourth quarter of the prior year in response to price increases to be effective in the first quarter of the current year  and the payment during the first quarter of each year of variable compensation with respect to the immediately preceding year 
typically  the other three quarters result in significant positive cash flow from operations after deducting cash used for capital expenditures  although the third quarter tends to produce relatively less positive cash flow primarily as a result of interest payments on the subordinated notes due in that quarter 
the company believes that the current year will follow the historical pattern 
in addition  to minimize interest expense  the company other than its brazilian subsidiary typically operates on a zero cash basis  using funds available under the revolving credit facility as its primary source of liquidity 
accordingly  in the absence of borrowing capability under the revolving credit facility  the company would have limited funds available to meet its debt service obligations and obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in april  the company obtained a limited waiver of certain covenants of the senior bank facilities and  in connection therewith  borrowed million under the revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the million  together with cash flow from operations after deducting cash used for capital expenditures will enable it to meet its debt service  trade and other obligations when due in the ordinary course of business during the second quarter of  including currently anticipated obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in this regard  the company believes that the plea agreement with the doj will assist it in its efforts to meet its obligations as they become due since the plea agreement permits the company to pay the million non interest bearing fine in six annual installments 
there can be no assurance  however  that obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims will not be greater than expected 
the company is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts from the million charge  antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain  the company expects the potential liabilities  expenses and other impacts of antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims to be material and adverse 
no assurance can be given that the company s cash flow from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its debt service and other obligations and respond to such impacts 
such impacts could require that the company limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  certain of its business plans  activities or operations  further reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell certain of its assets or businesses  restructure or refinance some or all of its debt or incur additional debt  or sell additional common stock or other securities 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
further  such impacts may ultimately require that the company seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
the company s current plan is to continue its long term strategy of being a low cost producer of high quality products and provider of superior services to customers 
consistent with this strategy and in order to maximize funds available to meet its obligations  the company is focusing significant efforts on reducing operating expenses  capital expenditures and other cash requirements and commitments  while maintaining necessary and appropriate business operations 
the company believes that the long term fundamentals of its business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although no assurance can be given that such will be the case  the company believes  based on its expected cash flow from operations and taking into account its efforts to maximize funds available to meet its obligations  it will be able to restructure its capitalization and manage its working capital and cash flow to permit it to meet its obligations as they become due 
overview of debt financing and description of waiver 
upon consummation of the recapitalization  the company established recapitalization bank credit facilities which provided for borrowings of up to million  of which million was used in connection with the recapitalization 
on october   the company refinanced such facilities with the senior bank facilities at more favorable interest rates and with more favorable covenants 
the senior bank facilities initially provided for borrowings of up to million  of which million was used in connection with the refinancing 
on march   the senior bank facilities were amended to reduce the interest rates on amounts outstanding thereunder  to increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility to million from million and to change certain covenants to allow greater flexibility in uses of free cash flow for acquisitions  capital expenditures and restricted payments 
in april  the company obtained a waiver of a breach  if any  of certain of the covenants contained in the senior bank facilities relating to the company s compliance with laws prior to march  and the company s obligation to deliver to the lenders under the senior bank facilities certain financial information within days of the end of the prior year 
in connection with the waiver  the company agreed to grant a security interest in substantially all  to the extent possible  of its assets and amend certain provisions of the senior bank facilities 
such amendments are likely to result in an increase in the interest rates applicable to the indebtedness outstanding under the senior bank facilities 
in addition  in connection with the waiver  on april   the company borrowed an additional million under the revolving credit facility 
the waiver is not effective for any additional borrowings and will terminate on the earlier to occur of july   the occurrence of any other event of default under the senior bank facilities or a date on which the lenders notify the company that the lenders believe that there has been  since december   a material adverse change in ucar s assets  business  properties  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
description of senior bank facilities 
the senior bank facilities consist of a a tranche a facility the tranche a facility in the amount of million consisting of i a tranche a letter of credit facility providing for the issuance of up to million of us dollar denominated letters of credit for the purpose of supporting either us dollar denominated or foreign currency denominated loans  and interest and the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations thereon  to certain foreign subsidiaries of global together with global  a wholly owned subsidiary of ucar  the credit parties under facilities arranged with local lending institutions  ii a tranche a term loan facility providing for term loans of million to global and iii a tranche a reimbursement loan facility in respect of drawings under such letters of credit or to refinance such loans to foreign subsidiaries  b a tranche b term loan facility the tranche b facility providing for term loans of million to global  and c a revolving credit facility the revolving facility providing for revolving and swingline loans to global and the issuance of us dollar denominated letters of credit for the account of global or other designated credit parties in an aggregate principal and stated amount at any time not to exceed million 
the revolving facility terminates on december the tranche a facility including the letters of credit issued thereunder amortizes in quarterly installments over four years  commencing march   with installments ranging from million in to million in  with the final installment payable on december  the tranche b facility amortizes over five years  commencing march   with nominal quarterly installments during the first four years  and quarterly installments aggregating million in  with the final installment payable on december  the company s next required installment payments for the tranche a and tranche b portions of the senior bank facilities of million and million  respectively  occur during during  the company made payments in advance of installments due on the tranche a facility and tranche b facility  of million and million  respectively million and million  respectively  during 
the company did not make any voluntary prepayments during the company enters into agreements with financial institutions which limit the company s exposure to the incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
during  the company purchased interest rate caps on up to million of debt  limiting interest expense on this debt to through during  the company purchased interest rate caps on million of debt  limiting interest expense on this debt to a weighted average rate of for the period commencing february and continuing through various dates ending february fees related to these agreements are charged to interest expense over the term of the agreements 
use of these interest rate risk instruments satisfies requirements under the senior bank facilities 
the credit parties are required to make mandatory prepayments of loans  and letters of credit are mandatorily reduced  subject to certain exceptions  in the amount of a either or depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined of ucar and its subsidiaries of consolidated excess cash flow as defined of global and its subsidiaries after giving effect to debt service on the senior bank facilities and the subordinated notes less voluntary prepayments previously made during a specified annual period  b of the net proceeds of certain dispositions of assets or stock of subsidiaries or incurrence of certain indebtedness by ucar  global or any of their subsidiaries and c of the net proceeds of the issuance of any equity securities by ucar 
no mandatory prepayments were required in the obligations of the credit parties under the senior bank facilities are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by ucar and each of its direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries collectively  the guarantors 
in addition  the senior bank facilities and such guarantees are secured by first priority or equivalent security interests in substantially all capital stock of global and the guarantors  including all the capital stock of  or other equity interests in  each other direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of global and of the capital stock of  or other equity interests in  each direct foreign subsidiary of global or any guarantor or  in any case in which global or any guarantor holds directly less than of such stock or equity interests in any foreign subsidiary  all such stock or equity interests held by global or such guarantor to the extent permitted by applicable contractual and legal provisions 
certain of the foreign subsidiaries have agreed to provide additional credit support for obligations of foreign credit parties in respect of the tranche a facility in the form of collateral and or cross guarantees 
in connection with the waiver  each of ucar and the credit parties agreed to grant  to the lenders under the senior bank facilities in the case of global and the guarantors  and  to the extent legally permitted  to each local facility lender in the case of the direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries of global  a first priority security interest in substantially all of the respective assets of ucar and the credit parties 
at global s option  the interest rates applicable to the tranche a facility and revolving facility are either adjusted libor as defined plus a margin ranging from to depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined of ucar and its subsidiaries or the alternate base rate 
the interest rate applicable to the tranche b facility is either adjusted libor plus or the alternate base rate plus 
the alternate base rate is the higher of chase manhattan bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
at the relevant foreign credit party s option  the interest rate applicable to its loans is either adjusted libor plus  an alternate base rate which varies from loan to loan or  in the case of local currency denominated loans  the local interbank offered rate plus 
in connection with the waiver  the company agreed to amend certain provisions of the senior bank facilities related to interest rate changes for borrowings under the tranche a facility and the revolving facility 
such amendments are likely to result in an increase in the interest rate applicable to the indebtedness outstanding under the senior bank facilities because the definition of ebitda has been modified  for purposes of determining certain applicable interest rates  to include any payments made with respect to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
global pays a per annum fee ranging from to depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined of ucar and its subsidiaries of the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit under the tranche a facility and under the revolving facility and a per annum fee ranging from to depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda as defined of ucar and its subsidiaries on the undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the senior bank facilities 
the senior bank facilities contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of global and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  repay or refinance other indebtedness or amend other debt instruments  create liens on assets  enter into leases  investments or acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries or pay dividends or make other restricted payments and that otherwise restrict corporate activities 
in addition  under the senior bank facilities  global is required to comply with specified minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
the senior bank facilities prohibit modification of the indenture related to the subordinated notes the subordinated note indenture in any manner adverse to the lenders under the senior bank facilities and limit global s ability to refinance the subordinated notes without the consent of such lenders 
in addition to the failure to pay principal and interest on amounts outstanding under  and fees in respect of letters of credit outstanding and undrawn commitments under the senior bank facilities  events of default under the senior bank facilities include failure to comply with the covenants in the senior bank facilities  failure to pay when due  or other defaults permitting acceleration of  other indebtedness exceeding million  judgment defaults in excess of million to the extent not covered by insurance  certain events of bankruptcy and certain changes in control 
for this purpose  a change in control occurs on the date on which ucar ceases to own of the outstanding capital stock of global  any person other than blackstone and company management beneficially owns more than of the total voting power of ucar at any time when blackstone and company management beneficially own less than a majority of such voting power  a majority of the directors of ucar then serving are individuals who were neither nominated by blackstone and company management or by a majority of the directors of ucar or by directors so nominated then serving or a change in control of ucar or global occurs under the indenture or agreement governing any other indebtedness exceeding million 
there can be no assurance that global will have the financial resources necessary to repay amounts due under the senior bank facilities upon an event of default thereunder 
description of subordinated notes

the subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness of global 
the subordinated notes will rank pari passu with any future senior subordinated indebtedness of global and senior to all other subordinated indebtedness of global 
the subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by ucar 
the subordinated note indenture contains various covenants which  among other things and in each case subject to significant specified exceptions  limit the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  limit the ability of global and its subsidiaries to pay dividends  make investments and other restricted payments  create or permit to exist restrictions on distributions from such subsidiaries  or sell assets and subsidiary stock unless the net cash proceeds are used to repay debt  invest in assets or repurchase subordinated notes  restrict transactions with affiliates  prohibit ucar from engaging in any business activities other than holding the stock of global and certain permitted investments and limit the ability of global to sell any capital stock of its subsidiaries or enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
in addition  under the subordinated note indenture  global is required to comply with specified ratios 
in addition to the failure to pay principal and interest on  or repurchase when required  the subordinated notes  events of default under the subordinated note indenture include failure to comply with certain covenants in the subordinated note indenture  failure to pay at maturity or acceleration of other indebtedness exceeding million  judgment defaults in excess of million to the extent not covered by insurance and certain events of bankruptcy 
the subordinated note indenture also contains provisions as to legal defeasance and covenant defeasance 
there can be no assurance that global will have the financial resources necessary to purchase the subordinated notes upon a change in control  pay amounts due in connection with any legal or covenant defeasance or to pay amounts due under the subordinated note indenture upon an event of default 
other impacts of recent developments 
the senior bank facilities and the subordinated note indenture contain a number of significant financial and restrictive covenants and other provisions  which have been impacted as a result of the million charge for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in april  the company obtained a limited waiver of certain covenants of the senior bank facilities and  in connection therewith  borrowed million under the revolving credit facility 
from january  through april   the company increased its borrowings under the revolving credit facility by million 
as of april   after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and million borrowed under the revolving credit facility  million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
in order to make additional borrowings thereunder  the company would need to  among other things  make certain representations  including representations as to the absence of material adverse changes in the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company and the absence of material legal proceedings 
in light of antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to make those representations or make additional borrowings thereunder 
in addition  even if the company is able to make additional borrowings thereunder  such ability may be limited by certain covenants contained in the subordinated note indenture 
under the subordinated note indenture  subject to certain exceptions  the company may not incur additional indebtedness if its consolidated coverage ratio as defined is less than certain specified ratios 
as a result of the million charge  the company s consolidated coverage ratio as defined is less than those specified ratios 
as a result  under the subordinated note indenture  the company cannot incur additional indebtedness except under the exceptions referred to above 
in the absence of the waiver  the company could have been in breach of the covenants contained in the senior bank facilities 
in addition  under the covenants contained in the senior bank facilities and the subordinated note indenture  the company s ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility in the future may be extremely limited or non existent 
as a result  the company may not have sufficient funds to meet its debt service obligations and its obligations in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims as well as pay its operating and other expenses when due 
further  the waiver does not restrict the lenders under the senior bank facilities from declaring that there has been a breach  after giving effect to the million charge  of material adverse change representations made in the past 
any or a combination of these circumstances and other circumstances described in this annual report on form k could result in the occurrence of an event of default under the senior bank facilities 
the occurrence of an event of default  which is not waived  would permit the lenders thereunder to  among other things  accelerate all indebtedness outstanding thereunder by declaring all amounts borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  the lenders could foreclose upon collateral pledged to secure repayment of such indebtedness and the commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the senior bank facilities would be terminated 
under the cross acceleration provisions of the subordinated note indenture  the holders of subordinated notes would thereupon likewise be able to accelerate all indebtedness outstanding under the subordinated notes 
further  even if such indebtedness is not accelerated  the occurrence of an event of default  which is not waived  could require the company to reclassify some or all of its long term debt to current debt 
such reclassification of the debt could result in the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph in any audit report  which refers to substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern  which could itself constitute a separate event of default thereunder 
such actions by the lenders would have material and adverse impacts on the company 
such impacts could require that the company limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  certain of its business plans  activities or operations  further reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell certain of its assets or businesses  some or all of its debt or incur additional debt  or sell additional common stock or other securities 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
further  such impacts may ultimately require that the company seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws

the company has elected to continue the accounting prescribed by apb accordingly  the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company with the exception of expanded disclosures required under sfas year the year issue is the result of computer programs written using two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in processing errors  miscalculations or failures causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is correcting the year issue by both replacing and or modifying its existing computer systems
