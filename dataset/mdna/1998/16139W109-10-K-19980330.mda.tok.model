inscorp s results of operations for the period from december  to december  were immaterial to chartwell  chartwell has accounted for the merger as though it had occurred on december  recent industry performance the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been highly cyclical 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing market conditions  including the underwriting results of primary insurers 
the supply of reinsurance is primarily related to levels of underwriting capacity in the reinsurance industry and the relative cost and terms of reinsurance coverage 
the industry s profitability and the cyclical trends in the industry can be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including the occurrence of natural disasters  other catastrophic events  competitive pressures on pricing premium rates  fluctuations in interest rates  other variations in the investment environment  changes in the judicial system regarding tort law  general economic conditions and trends  such as inflationary pressures  that may tend to affect the size of profits and losses experienced by ceding primary insurers and other factors such as changes in tax laws and regulations 
many sectors of the industry are currently in a cyclical downturn and it cannot be predicted if or when market conditions will improve or when other sectors may experience a deterioration in pricing and terms 
commencing in the late part of the s  primary property and casualty insurers began to retain more of their business 
this reduction in the amount of business ceded to reinsurers  combined with the growth in reinsurance capacity  resulted in renewed price competition and less attractive pricing for reinsurers 
this caused a downturn for the reinsurance industry  resulting in increased underwriting losses which have continued to the present 
the following table presents the statutory combined ratios of chartwell  the property and casualty reinsurance industry and the property and casualty insurance industry during the to years 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned and the underwriting expense ratio underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written

in connection with the acquisition  stockholders of archer holdings could elect to receive loan notes in the amount of one pound sterling for each pound sterling of cash consideration 
the aggregate amount of loan notes issued in connection with the consummation of the acquisition was million denominated in pounds sterling 
the loan notes  which are guaranteed by first union as described below  pay interest semi annually at the rate per annum calculated as one percent below the sterling london interbank offered rate libor and will mature in june  unless redeemed at an earlier date 
also in connection with the acquisition  re holdings entered into a new credit facility with first union  as agent the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for i a tranche a million loan  ii a tranche a million loan  iii a tranche b million loan denominated in pounds sterling tranche a  tranche a and tranche b collectively  the first union loans  and iv a million revolving credit facility subsequently increased to million the first union revolver

all amounts denominated in pounds sterling were converted to us dollars at the rate of per pound  the rate in effect at december  upon consummation of the merger  chartwell became the successor to piedmont under the ci notes 
the ci notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of million  which principal amount will accrue interest at a rate of per annum  compounded annually 
such interest will not be payable until maturity or earlier redemption of the ci notes 
in addition  the ci notes will entitle the holders thereof to receive at maturity  in proportion to the principal amount of the ci notes held by them  an aggregate of from million up to million in contingent interest 
settlement of the ci notes may be made by payment of cash or  under certain specified conditions  by delivery of shares of the company s common stock 
the ci notes mature on june  chartwell and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to the limitations contained in the senior notes indenture  the agreements governing the credit facility and the ci notes indenture 
the agreements governing the senior notes  the ci notes and the credit facility significantly restrict the ability of re holdings to make dividend and other payments to chartwell 
further  dividend payments by chartwell reinsurance and inscorp are subject to limits under the laws of the states of minnesota and new york  respectively 
under the applicable provisions of the insurance holding company laws of the state of minnesota  chartwell reinsurance may  upon five days notice to the commissioner of insurance of the state of minnesota the commissioner following the declaration of dividends to stockholders  and upon at least ten days notice to the commissioner prior to dividend payments  pay dividends without the approval of the commissioner  unless such dividends  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  exceed the greater of i of chartwell reinsurance s policyholders surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or ii chartwell reinsurance s statutory net income  excluding realized capital gains  for the prior calendar year 
any dividend in excess of the amount determined pursuant to the foregoing formula would be characterized as an extraordinary dividend requiring the prior approval of the commissioner 
in any case  the maximum amount of dividends chartwell reinsurance may pay is limited to its earned surplus  also known as unassigned funds 
as of december   chartwell reinsurance reported unassigned funds  as defined  in the amount of million 
up to million is available under the foregoing formula for the payment of dividends by chartwell reinsurance without regulatory approval in on november   chartwell reinsurance paid a million dividend to re holdings 
chartwell reinsurance paid no dividends in or under new york law  which is applicable to inscorp  the maximum ordinary dividend payable in any twelve month period without the approval of the superintendent may not exceed the lesser of a of policyholders surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement or any more recent quarterly statement or b the company s adjusted net investment income 
adjusted net investment income is defined as net investment income for the twelve months preceding the declaration of the dividend plus the excess  if any  of net investment income over dividends declared or distributed during the period commencing thirty six months prior to the declaration or distribution of the current dividend and ending twelve months prior thereto 
in any case  new york law permits the payment of an ordinary dividend by an insurer or reinsurer only out of earned surplus 
moreover  notwithstanding the receipt of any dividend from inscorp  chartwell reinsurance may make dividend payments to re holdings only to the extent permitted under the minnesota provisions described above 
in addition to the foregoing limitation  the new york insurance department  as is its practice in any change of control situation  required chartwell to commit to preclude the acquired new york domiciled insurer  inscorp  from paying any dividends for two years after the merger without prior regulatory approval 
the foregoing restriction expired on december  the maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends 
furthermore  beyond the limits described in the preceding paragraph  the commissioner and superintendent have discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies domiciled in minnesota and new york  respectively 
management believes that current levels of cash flow from operations and assets held at the holding company level provide the company with sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs in the short term over the next months 
management expects chartwell to be able to continue to meet its operating needs after the next months from internally generated funds 
since the ability of chartwell to meet its obligations in the long term beyond such month period is dependent upon such factors as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating needs 
the company expects that  in order to repay the principal amount of the senior notes on maturity or otherwise  it will be required to seek additional financing or engage in asset sales or similar transactions  and would be required to take similar actions in order to repay the ci notes on maturity or otherwise  in the event it chose or was required to settle the ci notes in cash rather than common stock 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to the company at such time 
year compliance the company believes that it has identified certain significant computer hardware and software applications that may require modification to ensure their continued proper operation  notwithstanding the change in century on january  year compliance 
the company is using both internal and external resources to test such significant computer systems and applications and to make the modifications necessary for year compliance 
the testing and modification process  which is proceeding on schedule  is expected to be completed by june  in addition  the company has contacted certain of its significant business partners and service vendors to determine their year compliance readiness as well as the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year compliance issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will become year compliant in a timely manner  or that the failure by a third party to become year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost to the company to test and modify all systems to be year compliant has not been  and is not expected to be  material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
these estimates of cost and the anticipated completion date for year compliance are based on management s best estimates utilizing current data regarding available resources  coordination with third parties and other relevant factors and information about systems conversion 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from the current plan

requires impairment of property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles and goodwill to be considered whenever evidence suggests a lack of recoverability 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of chartwell 
regulatory accounting practices management does not believe that current accounting changes being contemplated by regulatory authorities  if implemented  would have a significant effect on the operations or liquidity of chartwell 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on chartwell are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on chartwell s results cannot be accurately determined until ultimate losses are settled 
however  based on the actual results reported to date  management believes that premium rates and loss reserves  including reserves for losses that have been incurred but not reported  adequately incorporate the effects of inflation
