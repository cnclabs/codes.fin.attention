benefit provision for income taxes net income loss revenues product revenue includes hardware sales and software license fees 
effective july   the company changed its revenue recognition policy on system sales to end users such that revenues from system sales are generally recognized upon shipment 
previously  the company generally recognized system sales to end users when the equipment had been shipped  installed and accepted by the end user 
the reason for this change was to better conform the company s policy with industry practices 
the installation of the company s systems is not considered a significant obligation and acceptance by the customer is not considered a significant uncertainty 
revenues from upgrade sales are generally recognized at the time the equipment is shipped 
provisions for product sales returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenue 
revenue earned under software license agreements with end users are generally recognized when the software has been shipped and there are no significant obligations remaining 
service revenue includes installation  maintenance and training and is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are provided 
the following table sets forth the principal components of the company s revenues years ended june  product revenue    service revenue    total revenues    product revenue decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal after growth of million  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal decrease was due to a million one time order from a large internet service provider in fiscal and a million decrease in revenue from japan  which made revenue comparisons difficult  compounded by product transition issues and increased competitive pressures 
the fiscal increases were attributable to the million one time order  higher average system prices and increased sales of upgrades to the company s installed base 
revenue from product upgrades  which primarily consist of additional processors or upgrades of existing processors  memory disk and tape drives  remained relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal revenue from product upgrades increased to in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal increase in product upgrade revenue as a percentage of total revenues compared to fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of the installed base of customers  demand from customers for increased storage capacity and the company s periodic product enhancements 
the company provides ongoing support and maintenance to its end user customers  distributors and oems  generally under annual service agreements 
service revenue as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the increase in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues compared to fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of the installed base of customers and the company s investment in expanding its customer service organization 
the following table sets forth the company s revenue by geographic area in thousands years ended june  north america    pacific rim    europe    total revenues    revenue from north america decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal decrease was due to a million one time order from a large internet service provider in fiscal revenue from the pacific rim decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in pacific rim revenue as a percentage of total revenue and in absolute dollars in fiscal  and was primarily due to the reorganization of a major oem partner and weakness in the japanese economy 
sales of products and services to intel accounted for  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
sales to aol accounted for of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  additionally  sales to fuji xerox accounted for of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  no other customer accounted for or more of total revenues for any of the three years in the period ended june  intel is not obligated to purchase any minimum level of products from the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales of products and services to intel will not decline  either in absolute dollar amounts or as a percentage of total revenues  in future periods and that any such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
gross margin the company s gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
costs of revenues include material costs  manufacturing and service overhead costs  installation and warranty expenses  obsolescence  the cost of spare parts and other related costs 
the decrease in gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to million of charges incurred for the write down of disk drive inventory to its net realizable value as a result of rapid price declines of four gigabyte drives coupled with an accelerated transition by the company to nine gigabyte drive technology and product obsolescence 
the decrease in gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to pricing on systems sales and lower margins on service 
this was partially offset by a significant increase in software revenue 
operating expenses marketing and sales expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and were  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was the result of an expansion of the north american direct sales operations  the growth of direct sales operations of the company s international subsidiaries and lower total revenues in fiscal research and development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to new product development efforts  the funding of the company s new research and development facility acquired in the alphatronix acquisition and the lower total revenue in fiscal the company believes that in order to remain competitive  it will need to continue to make substantial investments in new and enhanced products  and it anticipates that research and development expenses may increase in both absolute amounts and or as a percentage of total revenue from current levels 
general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal such expenses represented approximately of total revenue in each of fiscal  and general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the cost of expanding new facilities occupied in february general and administrative expenses remained generally flat in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million restructuring charge to cover the planned costs of reducing certain sectors of its workforce  scaling back its facilities and writing down equipment and other assets 
these charges reflect steps the company is taking to improve its product development efforts  streamline operations and reduce overall costs 
on june   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of alphatronix for a total purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was  and  respectively 
in addition  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no probable alternative future uses  which the company expensed in fiscal as a non recurring charge 
the remainder of the purchase price   was allocated to goodwill and is being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
alphatronix s r d projects relate primarily to developing a suite of network data management software applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in making commercially viable products from the alphatronix research and development 
other income other income and expense resulted in income of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income and expense includes interest income  interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in fiscal and as compared to fiscal primarily relates to an increase in the cash and short term investments balances 
provision for income taxes as of june   the company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million 
management has determined  based on the company s history of prior operating earnings  the ability to carry back net operating losses to prior periods and its expectations for future years  that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset is realizable 
however  no assurances can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated in future years for the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
the company recognized a tax benefit of approximately million for fiscal  which will be realized in fiscal  due to the anticipated carryback of current net operating losses to prior periods 
the provision for income taxes was approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to the fact that the company had not provided any tax benefits related to the write off of in process research and development expenses of approximately million resulting from the acquisition of alphatronix in fiscal excluding the write off of in process research and development expenses  which accounts for an increase of in the effective tax rate in fiscal  the company s effective tax rate would have been 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight quarters 
this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and in management s opinion reflects all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
based on the company s operating history and factors that may cause fluctuations in the quarterly results  quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
although the company s revenues are not generally seasonal in nature  the company has experienced decreases in first quarter revenue versus the preceding fourth quarter which are believed to result primarily from the capital asset purchase cycle of the company s customers 
the level of the company s operating expenses is partially based on its expectations of future revenue 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if revenue does not materialize in a period as expected 
since expense levels are usually committed in advance of revenue and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue  the company s net income may be impacted significantly by lower revenue 
the company s revenue decreased each quarter in fiscal compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year 
this decrease was due principally to lower sales volume or lower average selling prices of the company s products as a result of product transition issues  increased competitive pressures and weakness in japan

liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million as of june   compared to june  the company generated approximately million  million and million in cash from operating activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the company s net loss for the year and the increase in the income tax refund receivable which was offset by a reduction in accounts receivable 
the company s principal investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment amounting to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenditures were for leasehold improvements  equipment for research and development  manufacturing test equipment  office equipment and spare parts to support customer service contracts 
additionally  the company disbursed million in connection with capital expenditures and leasehold improvements for a new facility  which it occupied in february purchases of short term investments represent reinvestment of the proceeds from sale and maturities of short term investments and investment of cash and cash equivalents into short term investments 
the company also used net cash of million for the acquisition of alphatronix in fiscal the company s primary financing activities included proceeds from the sale of its common stock pursuant to employee benefit plans of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   working capital was million as compared with million as of june  based on its current operating plans  the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditures requirements at least through the next months 
factors that may affect future results the seventh paragraph of the section entitled the company in part i  the seventh paragraph of the section entitled products in part i  the first sentence in the fourth paragraph of the section entitled distribution in part i  the fourth sentence of the second paragraph of the section entitled research and development in part i  the last sentence in the second paragraph of the section entitled operating expenses in part ii  the second sentence of the first paragraph of the section entitled provision for income taxes in part ii  the last sentence of the fourth paragraph under the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in part ii  the third sentence of the risk factor entitled software product risks in factors that may affect future performance in part ii  the third sentence of the risk factor entitled new products in factors that may affect future performance  the second sentence of the risk factors entitled risks of international sales in factors that may affect future performance  the fifth  sixth and seventh sentence of the first paragraph  the second sentence of the fourth paragraph  the entire eighth paragraph  the last sentence of the ninth paragraph  the last sentence of the tenth paragraph and the entire eleventh paragraph of the section entitled year compliance in factors that may affect future performance contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the company may also make oral and written forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below 
the company undertakes no obligation to update such information 
potential significant fluctuations in quarterly results the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a combination of factors 
these factors include the timing of orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  and the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold 
the company generally realizes higher gross margins on sales of systems to end users and on single system sales than on systems sold through distributors and oems and on multiple system sales 
in addition  given the company s focus on highly configured enterprise class systems  the loss or delay in a given quarter of a relatively limited number of system sales could adversely affect the company s revenues 
historically  the company often has recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of any given quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
competitive market the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company experiences substantial competition  principally from sun microsystems  hewlett packard company and silicon graphics  inc  among others 
some companies have introduced proprietary products to provide network attached storage 
most of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of product upgrades to its installed base of customers  including additional processors  memory and disk 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrades sales 
in addition  decisions by customers not to increase capacity to their current systems could adversely impact the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
dependence on key personnel competition for employees with highly technical  management and other skills is intense in the computer industry and is particularly intense in the san francisco bay area 
the company has in the recent past encountered some difficulties in fulfilling its hiring needs and retaining key employees in this employment market  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring and retaining qualified employees in the future 
the company s failure to retain the services of key personnel or to attract additional qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
software product risks the company markets optional software products in addition to its line of network file servers 
these software products include netservices tm  driveguard tm  fastbackup tm  serverguard tm  serverguard global tm and dataguard tm 
the company also expects to release enhancements and new features for these products from time to time 
although the company performs extensive testing prior to releasing software products  such products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released 
these may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments 
failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could delay product introductions  require design modifications to previously shipped products  cause unfavorable publicity or negatively impact system shipments  any of which could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products new product introductions by the company or its competitors carry the risk that customers could delay or cancel orders for existing products pending shipment of the new products 
for instance  product transition issues had an adverse impact on north america revenue in fiscal the company s strategy is to continue to introduce new products and upgrades to existing products on an ongoing basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products and enhancements or that these new products and enhancements will adequately address market requirements  achieve market acceptance or generate substantial sales 
additionally  delays in the launch or lack of availability of new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on established standards the rapid emergence of new or alternate standards such as windows nt which replace or diminish the market acceptance of unix operating systems or nfs  on which the company s products are currently based  could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations unless the company is able to incorporate any such standards in the company s products in a timely manner 
dependence on certain customers distributors for fiscal and  direct sales of products and services to intel represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
also in fiscal  direct sales of products and services to aol represented approximately of the company s revenues 
for fiscal year  sales to fuji xerox  the company s non exclusive master value added distributor in japan  represented approximately of the company s revenues 
intel  aol and fuji xerox are not obligated to purchase any minimum level of products from the company 
additional significant reductions in product sales to intel  aol or fuji xerox would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the reduced purchases by aol and fuji xerox contributed to lower revenue in fiscal dependence on certain suppliers certain of the company s products contain critical components supplied by a single or limited number of third parties 
while the company has an inventory of these critical components  any significant or prolonged shortage of these components or the failure of the third party suppliers to maintain or enhance these components could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
excess or obsolete inventory managing the company s inventory of components and finished products is a complex task 
a number of factors  including but not limited to  the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components which are in short supply or which must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing  the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules  may result in the company maintaining large amounts of inventory 
other factors  including changes in market demand and technology  may cause inventory to become obsolete 
any excess or obsolete inventory could result in price reductions and or inventory write downs  which in turn could adversely affect the company and its results of operations 
for example  the company wrote down million of certain disk drive inventories in the second quarter of fiscal  and this write down had an adverse effect on gross margins 
risks of international sales  european and japanese market risks during fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues were derived from markets outside of north america 
the company expects that sales to the pacific rim and europe will continue to represent a significant portion of its business 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s pacific rim or european operations will continue to be successful 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from localized economic and market conditions 
for example  the company experienced a decrease in revenues from the pacific rim during fiscal due to further weakness in the japanese economy and effects from continuing organizational change at one of the company s major japanese distributors 
in addition  the company s international business may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency restrictions 
the company purchases the majority of its materials and services in us dollars  and most of its foreign sales are transacted in us dollars 
continued increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will make the company s products sold internationally less price competitive 
the company has offices in a number of foreign countries  the operating expenses of which are also subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
financial exposure may result due to the timing of transactions and movement of exchange rates 
the company s international business may further be affected by risks such as trade restrictions  increase in tariff and freight rates and difficulties in obtaining necessary export licenses and meeting appropriate local regulatory standards 
for example  the company has had to modify its products in minor respects in japan to comply with local electromagnetic emissions standards  and must also comply with corresponding european economic community standards 
in marketing its products to the european economic community  the company also must face the challenges posed by a fragmented market complicated by local distribution channels and local cultural considerations 
for international sales  the company has largely relied on distributors or oems  most of whom are entitled to carry products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing risks or issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock market fluctuations in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
intellectual property and proprietary rights  pending litigation the company currently relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its hardware and software products 
the company currently holds seven united states patents and has filed applications for additional patents 
the company also has filed applications for counterpart patents in foreign countries  including japan 
there can be no assurance that the company s present or future competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications will result in issued patents  or that the company s issued patents will be upheld if challenged 
additionally  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future projects or that any such assertions may not require the company to refrain from the sale of its products  enter into royalty arrangements or undertake costly litigation 
the company s adherence to industry standards with respect to its products limits the company s opportunities to provide proprietary features which may be protected 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company is subject to various claims which arise in the normal course of business 
the company believes that the litigation  individually or in the aggregate  to which it is currently a party  is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with the year problem 
the company s new products  as of fiscal  are being designed to be year compliant as the company has defined that term in its published statements 
however  some of the company s older products will not be year compliant and  as a result  the company s customers will be required to upgrade these products 
although products have undergone  or will undergo  the company s normal quality testing procedures  there can be no assurance that the company s products will contain all necessary date code changes 
any failure of the company s products to perform  including system malfunctions due to the onset of year  could result in claims against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company s customers could choose to convert to other year compliant products or to develop their own products in order to avoid such malfunctions  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently is in the process of auditing its own information technology infrastructure for year compliance  including reviewing what actions are required to make all software systems year compliant as well as actions needed to mitigate the risks of year such actions include a review of vendors contracts  attention to year issues in future contracts with vendors and formal communications with suppliers requesting that they certify that their products are year compliant 
state of readiness the company has been actively addressing the year issues since fiscal the following sections broadly address year matters with respect to the company s a suppliers  b facilities and infrastructure  c information technology systems  d engineering infrastructure  and e manufacturing operation year compliance assessment 
suppliers during fiscal  the company sent a year readiness letter questionaire to its suppliers 
very few responses to this letter were received and  as a result  the company is undertaking the following a new readiness letter questionaire is being generated and will be mailed to all suppliers by the end of october  the company is in the process of identifying and devoting resources to ensure the year compliance of significant and or critical suppliers  supplier response to the new year readiness letter questionaire will be closely monitored  and follow up communication will be initiated with significant and or critical suppliers who do not respond to the year readiness letter questionaire 
based on their responses and results of the readiness letter questionaire  alternate suppliers may need to be identified by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find suitable alternate suppliers and contract with them on reasonable terms  or at all  and such inability could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
facilities and infrastructure the company s new headquarters facility in santa clara and domestic remote sites are year compliant with respect to building automation systems and electronic security systems 
the company has presented formal queries to landlords  local fire departments and utility providers with regard to year compliance readiness 
formal responses have not been received as of this filing 
the company believes that its english and french facilities are year compliant  however  the german and japanese facilities have not responded formally to the company s inquiries as of this filing 
information technology systems over the past several years  the company has invested in a number of year compliant pbxs and voice mail systems 
the one current non compliant year pbx system resides in alphatronix 
plans are in place to migrate this system to a year compliant pbx system by the end of calendar year no effort has yet been spent on verifying year compliance of local telephone systems of most sales offices  and the company expects to have verified such compliance by the end of fiscal the company believes that its internal production data communication network is year compliant 
a majority of the key components of the network  which the company believes to be year compliant  were installed within the past nine months 
the company s wide area network requirements are provided by a major national and international carrier  and the company expects this carrier to be year compliant 
for local services that are provided by local carriers  the company has not yet invested a significant amount of time to verify their year readiness  but intends to verify compliance by the end of fiscal the company has replaced or upgraded  or is in the process of replacing upgrading  many of its core applications systems 
a new year compliant enterprise resource planning package was installed in the first calendar quarter of an upgrade to a newer version of this package is planned for the fourth calendar quarter of which incorporates several year compliance related bug fixes 
an active project is underway to upgrade the company s payroll and human resources systems to year compliant systems by the end of september the company s customer call tracking system is being upgraded to provide additional functionality and stability 
part of the project plan for this upgrade will be to confirm the vendor s assertion that the product is year compliant 
during fiscal  the company invested in a desktop upgrade program 
the standard personal computers and laptop computers installed during this period are year compliant to the extent the vendors have affirmed 
testing has confirmed the commonly used functions operate satisfactorily 
not every desktop application has been fully tested 
engineering infrastructure the company s engineering infrastructure is in a continual state of change due to the dynamic nature of the company s business and focus on new products 
as older products are retired and new products developed  the tools  equipment and laboratory environments change 
the company is in the process of assessing the year issues of its engineering infrastructure and will complete such assessment by the end of september manufacturing operations the company is primarily an assemble to order manufacturing operation 
there is no significant automated assembly equipment on its manufacturing shop floor 
the company is in the process of reviewing its manufacturing operations for potential year issues and will complete such assessment by the end of september costs to address year issues the company expects to incur total software  hardware and systems related costs of approximately million and solutions providers costs of approximately  in connection with remediations of year compliance issues 
there can be no assurance that the cost estimates associated with the company s year issues will prove to be accurate or that the actual costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
year issues the company s technical support representatives work closely with customers to resolve problems  issues and questions 
the company s customer satisfaction organization uses several toll free phone numbers to address customer problems  issues and questions 
these calls are logged and tracked using a call management system 
customer satisfaction has a significant reliance on communications  voice mail  email  paging  web and file transfer program services and data communications 
given the number and variety of suppliers and their inter dependencies  the number and location of worldwide customers and the number and locations of the various technical support offices  it is not feasible to fully test whether the company will be able to guarantee that each customer will be able to contact and or do business with customer satisfaction without disruption 
the company expects an increase in calls during the period of the year transition  which will likely impact customer satisfaction responsiveness 
contingency plans the company currently is in the process of preparing contingency plans for the year compliance issues areas noted above and the company anticipates completing those plans by september there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the occurrence of year problems  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio 
years ended june in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents and short term investments fixed rate short term investments    average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk the company transacts business in various foreign countries 
its primary foreign currency cash flows are in certain european countries 
during fiscal   and  the company employed a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge local currency cash flows for payroll and other operating expenditures in these european countries 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s local currency operating expenses and other cash outflows  as translated into us dollars  are partially offset by realized gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on the company s foreign currency cash outflows rather than to eliminate the possibility of short term earnings volatility 
as of june   the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts were comprised of million in british pounds and million in german marks
