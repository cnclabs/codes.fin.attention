the company s revenue from construction contracts and costs of construction contracts both increased by from to billion and billion  respectively 
the value of new contracts secured in was billion  slightly down from the billion secured in although contracts secured were slightly down in  anticipated earnings associated with these new contracts increased from at december   the company s backlog of value of construction to be completed was billion and anticipated earnings associated with backlog from construction contracts was million its highest level in seven years  compared to billion and million  respectively  at december  these results continue to reflect the growth of the company s non residential construction market and the high level of construction activity throughout the country

these losses were in addition to the million loss on the minneapolis project in the losses on the minneapolis project are principally related to significant changes in the design and scope of the project  which resulted in increased costs and time extensions  as well as certain changes to original estimates of costs 
the company is currently seeking additional revenue from the owner relating to the design and scope changes beyond the original contract 
there are no future losses anticipated by the company relating to its caribbean operations and the minneapolis project that have not been previously provided for in the company s financial statements 
work under construction management contracts as a percentage of value of construction completed continued to decline  from in to in construction management contracts normally involve lower risk  and therefore carry lower fees  than other types of contracts

the company s operating units and subsidiaries were able to achieve record revenue levels without adding to operating costs

because these expenses are non cash in nature  the company realized positive cash flow for each of these years  even after payment of interest on real estate debt 
as conditions continue to improve in the real estate market  the company will actively monitor the fair values of the properties and the appropriate timing of disposition  and make adjustments to the recoverable carrying values as necessary
