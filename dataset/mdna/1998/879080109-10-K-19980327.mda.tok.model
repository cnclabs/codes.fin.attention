these forward looking statements are subject to factors beyond the control of the company such as weather and market forces and with respect to the company s future development of its land  the availability of financing and the ability to obtain various governmental entitlements 
no assurance can be given that actual future events will be consistent with the forward looking statements made in this annual report 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  net income was  in   in  and  in net income for increased when compared to due to higher operating profits within the livestock division and increased easement sales within the real estate division 
net income for increased when compared to due to improved operating profits within the livestock  farming  and real estate divisions 
changes in revenues and expenses of registrant s industry segments for years and are summarized below 
livestock 
livestock net operating income of  in was an increase of  when compared to net operating income 
the growth in net operating income is due primarily to an increase in cattle sales revenue  and net operating income provided by the cattle feedlot that was purchased early in 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in cost of sales on cattle sold of approximately  cattle sales revenue grew during due to an increase in volume of cattle sold and higher prices on the cattle sold 
during   additional head of cattle were sold and the weights at which the cattle were sold averaged approximately pounds per head greater than in cost of sales increased due to owning the cattle for longer periods of time during than in past years 
registrant  with the purchase of the feedlot  has changed its operating procedures and is holding and owning the cattle through the feeding phase in order to have more direct control over the quality of beef the cattle are producing 
by holding the cattle for a longer period of time  the weights on the cattle will increase and registrant will receive more for the animal but the cost of sales also increases due to the costs of feeding for the additional period of ownership 
registrant continued to use the futures and options markets to protect the future selling price of cattle and purchase prices of feed 
without the ability to hedge cattle and feed positions  registrant would have sustained a net loss on the sale of its cattle during during  due to the increase in cattle prices throughout most of the year  registrant recognized approximately  in losses on hedge positions 
gains on hedge positions totaled approximately  during many of these gains were due to the continuing decline of cattle prices during  especially during the first half of registrant s goal in hedging its cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that in years like and  allow registrant to recognize a profit on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in hedging cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price or can add additional costs for feed if grain prices fall dramatically 
cattle prices improved throughout until late and early when the impact of the asian financial crisis hit the cattle commodity markets 
with beef being the largest dollar agricultural export and asia receiving much of the beef exported  prices fell significantly during december through february not only have prices declined in the beef market  but prices for hides  which are used in the production of leather  have also declined 
hide prices have declined almost over this time period 
it is anticipated that prices later in will improve when compared to current levels due to fewer head of cattle being in feedlots for sale 
the increase in prices is expected to be less than would normally be expected due to the economic problems in asia 
overall  registrant believes it will see lower prices during  which will impact cattle sales revenues 
on march   registrant purchased the assets of a feedlot that is located in western texas 
registrant will operate this feedlot for its use as well as that of other customers who want to feed cattle 
the feedlot was purchased for million  has a cattle head capacity of  and covers approximately acres 
registrant believes that by controlling the feeding phase of its cattle before sending them to packing houses  a better quality product will be produced providing higher margins to registrant 
during  the feedlot produced approximately  in revenues and a net operating profit of  registrant believes that the revenues generated by the new feedlot operation will continue to be material to future earnings 
in connection with the purchase of the feedlot registrant began a program in to expand the cattle herd 
at december  registrant had  head of cattle  which is approximately  head more than in this will allow registrant to provide additional cattle for the feedlot operation and potentially increase the earnings from its cattle operations 
registrant is also becoming involved in a strategic alliance with other select producers and a packer to produce a high grade beef product to be sold to steak restaurants and higher end grocery stores 
the strategic alliance was formed in order for the producers of cattle to gain higher margins on the beef they produce and sell 
livestock operating profits of  in  grew  when compared to operating profits 
the growth in operating profits is due to a decrease in cost of sales  which was partially offset by reduced cattle sales revenue 
cost of sales declined during due to cattle being placed in feedlots for periods of time shorter than in and to better grazing conditions during during  registrant delayed the sale of approximately  head of cattle from may to october and placed these cattle in feedlots during the summer months of the expense associated with four extra months of feedlot costs during is the primary reason for the favorable cost of sales variance 
the reduction in cattle sales revenue is due primarily to fewer pounds of cattle being sold in than in during  more head of cattle were sold   head of cattle compared to  head of cattle in  but at weights which were approximately pounds per head less than in when cattle were held in feedlots for four extra months 
as in cattle prices per pound continued to be depressed throughout see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of registrant s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
farming operating profits of  in are  less than operating profits 
the decline in operating profits is due to a drop in almond revenues  lower walnut revenues  and higher cultural costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased grape revenues  the receipt in of revenues associated with the crop  and lower fixed water costs the decrease in almond revenues during was due to a decrease in production of when compared to and a decrease in prices of approximately 
registrant s production fell during due to the timing of rains and cold weather during the critical pollination period 
prices declined due to the california almond industry producing a near record crop 
walnut revenues declined due to a drop in production during the decline in walnut production was due primarily to below normal chilling hours that are required by walnut trees for adequate dormancy during the winter months 
grape revenues increased primarily due to an increase in production of when compared to production increased due to favorable summer weather 
the additional revenue received in related to the harvest was due to final market prices for grapes and almonds being higher than originally forecasted by the grape and almond industries 
cultural costs increased due to higher chemical costs  expenses associated with crops coming into production that were capitalized in prior years and increased harvest costs due to the high grape production 
overall crop revenues were higher than expected due mainly to higher wine grape production and the receipt in of revenues associated with the crop 
almond  walnut  and pistachio demand is expected to remain good during and the near future 
industry expectations are that statewide nut crop yields should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices 
in addition  industry projections show a continuation of new almond and pistachio plantings that could impact prices once full production begins 
registrant s almond crop as well as the crops of other producers within california may be negatively impacted by the winter rain and winds caused by el nino storms during february and march that arrived during the critical bee pollination period 
this potential decline in production could help stabilize prices on almonds at current levels 
in registrant signed a five year contract with a winery that provides the better of a minimum price or market price for grapes each year 
this contract is beneficial to the registrant because it helps minimize future price fluctuations 
within the grape industry there continues to be new land developed  which could depress prices in the future once all new developments are in full production 
pricing pressure on grapes did begin during due to high industry production and should continue into all of registrant s crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item business farming operations 
farming operating profits increased  in to  which was a increase over operating profits 
in comparison to  net operating income increased due to higher pistachio revenues  higher grape revenues  higher almond revenues  and the charge off of destroyed almond trees of  which occurred during partially offsetting these favorable variances was an increase in fixed water costs of  and in cultural costs of  the increase in cultural costs was primarily due to higher harvesting costs 
grape revenues grew  in due to increases in prices 
on average the price received by registrant increased approximately per ton of grapes 
the almond revenue increase during was due to a increase in production 
the increase in production was partially offset by almond prices falling when compared to prices 
pistachio revenues were  higher in due to an increase in production 
pistachio production increased approximately because was the on production year in the alternate year bearing cycle 
walnut revenues increased  during due to prices rising approximately during resource management 
resource management net operating income of  in was  or below net operating income 
the decrease in net operating income during was due to lower revenues from oil and gas royalties  increases in professional service fees and an increase in staffing costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased sand rock aggregate royalties  cement royalties  and game management permits 
oil and gas royalties declined due to lower prices for crude oil within california and the continuing decline of oil exploration activities on ranch lands 
professional service fees and staffing costs increased due to the ongoing monitoring of the activities of oil and gas lessees and monitoring of environmental activities at the national cement lease site 
sand rock and cement royalties increased during due to the growth of construction within southern california and kern county 
game management permit revenues increased due to an expansion of services offered and an increase in hunting programs 
the resource management division has been very profitable over the last several years 
however  oil and gas royalties are expected to be adversly affected over the next few years by the fact than little or no new oil and gas exploration is taking place on registrant s lands and oil prices during early are at the lowest levels in years 
registrant does expect royalties from cement production to grow over the next few years due to increased construction activity and to the cement manufacturing plant being renovated and production capacity being increased 
see part i  item business resource management  for a further discussion of activities and future expectations 
resource management operating profits of  in were  or greater than operating profits 
the increase in operating profits during was primarily due to the growth of filming location fees and higher oil and gas royalties and cement royalties 
these increases were partially offset by lower sand rock aggregate royalties and increased professional service fees 
filming location fees increased due to a much more aggresive marketing program which increased the number of films and commercials that used registrant s lands for location film shoots 
oil and gas royalties increased due to an increase in oil prices throughout  and cement royalties were higher due to increases in production because of the growth in construction within southern california 
sand rock royalties declined due to winter weather during early which delayed the start of several construction projects 
professional service fees increased due to the monitoring of environmental activities at the national cement site 
real estate 
real estate operating profits of  in is a  increase when compared to s operating loss 
the increase during is due primarily to the receipt of a one time payment of   net of tax in revenue from a pipeline company for the acquisiton of easement rights 
this increase is partially offset by higher professional service and planning fees  and higher staffing costs 
professional service fees increased due to market evaluations being conducted to determine the feasibility of developing a destination land use at grapevine center and a rural ranch estates program 
staffing costs increased due to the hiring of a new vice president of real estate 
see part i  item  business commercial and land use and part i  item  properties land planning  for a further discussion of and activity and future planning activities 
the operating loss of  was a  improvement over s operating loss of  the improvement in was due to a decrease in professional service fees  and a gain from the sale of land 
partially offsetting the above favorable variances was an increase in fixed water costs of  registrant s commercial lease revenue during was flat when compared to lease revenues 
professional service fees declined due to the timing of planning activities on registrant s lands related to the interstate corridor and the absence of any costs during related to the proposed major crude oil pipeline through registrant s land 
the costs associated with the pipeline were incurred during fixed water costs grew due to the transfer of additional state water project water that can be used in the future for municipal and industrial uses 
in addition to the cost of this additional water  a local water district charged registrant for costs related to a water banking program 
interest 
interest income declined to  during from  in due to a  reduction in funds invested 
investment funds declined due to the purchase of the feedlot  capital expenditures  an increase in the cattle herd  and the payment of dividends 
interest income in fell  or  when compared to interest income 
the reduction during is due primarily to lower average invested dollars throughout when compared to on average million was invested during while million was invested during investment funds declined due to capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
interest expense for was  an increase of  over the growth in interest expense was due to the addition of long term debt associated with the purchase of the cattle feedlot  outstanding and the short term funding of the growth in the cattle herd 
the feedlot also borrows on a short term basis to provide cattle and feed financing for its outside customers 
the cost of this borrowing approximates the bank s prime interest rate 
the feedlot then charges its customers the national prime interest rate plus one to one and one half percent for any financings it does 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a further discription of short term and long term debt 
interest expense declined in to  from  in interest expense during was attributable to the remaining balance of long term debt used to finance registrant s acre almond and acre wine grape developments  which were developed in  and use of registrant s working capital line of credit 
the increase in expense during was due to registrant increasing the usage of short term lines of credit which became necessary because of delays in the sale of cattle and the timing of crop proceeds 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses for were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase is due to higher professional service charges and staffing costs 
staffing costs increased due to to the fact that registrant s new chief executive officer joined registrant in may and served the full year of professional service fees increased due to costs associated with consulting contracts with an investment banking firm 
corporate expenses for were  or  higher than corporate expenses for the increase in costs is primarily due an increase in staffing costs  and employee relocation costs 
these variances were partially offset by a reduction in professional service fees 
the increase in staffing costs and relocation costs was primarily related to the hiring of a new chief executive officer in may inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on registrant s operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to registrant s farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received by registrant for many of its products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for registrant to accurately predict revenue  just as it cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  registrant plans to adopt sfas no 
and sfas no 
with the fiscal year beginning january  sfas no 
and sfas no 
do not have any impact on the financial results or financial condition of registrant  but will result in the disclosure of the components of comprehensive income 
impact of year during early  registrant completed the conversion to new accounting and financial software that identifies the date by using four digits for the year 
registrant at this time believes that the new software installed will eliminate its internal exposure to year problems 
registrant is in the process of initiating formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which registrant s systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
no assurances can be given that the systems of other companies on which registrant s systems rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the registrant s systems 
financial condition 
registrant s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is comparable to s working capital 
working capital uses during the year were for capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of the cattle feedlot and the payment of dividends 
registrant has a revolving line of credit of  that as of december   had a balance of  bearing interest at the rate of 
registrant also has an outstanding short term borrowing with an investment banking firm with a balance of  at december  at an interest rate of 
the feedlot registrant acquired also has a short term revolving line of credit with a local bank for  the outstanding balance at december  was  with an interest rate approximating the bank s prime lending rate of 
the revolving lines of credit are used as a short term cash management tools and for the financing of customer cattle and feed receivables at the feedlot 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of the cattle feedlot  purchase of land  payments of long term debt and the payment of dividends 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows by registrant is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of registrant s products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
registrant  based on its past experience  believes it will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes new equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
registrant is currently expanding its farming operations with two new farming developments  will continue the expansion of the cattle herd  and is investing approximately million in the infrastructure and off site improvements related to the travel plaza joint venture and industrial park 
these new projects will be funded from current cash resources and registrant s excess borrowing capacity 
registrant has traditionally funded its growth and capital additions from internally generated funds 
management believes that the combination of short term investments  excess borrowing capacity  and capital presently available to it will be sufficient for its near term operations
