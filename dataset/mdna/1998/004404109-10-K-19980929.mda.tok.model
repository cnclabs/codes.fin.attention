as a result of the size of most of its contracts and orders  the significant length of sales cycles and the complexities which arise from time to time in completing any given contract or order  the company typically experiences fluctuations in quarterly and year to year results 
marketing in foreign countries  particularly in asia and other emerging markets  frequently requires extensive field testing and may result in delays in the timing and closing of sales by the company s strategic alliance partners  which in turn may delay orders of the company s products

the use of cash for operations was primarily due to the funding of operating losses

accounts receivables  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  declined to million at june  from million at june  accounts receivables include billed accounts receivables  unbilled accounts receivables and an allowance for doubtful accounts 
billed accounts receivables declined to million at june  from million at june  reflecting a decline in revenue in as well as more active management of the outstanding receivables

the company believes these reserves are adequate 
gross inventories increased from million at june  to million at june  the increase of million was primarily due to the purchase of hardware for a significant order which was received  but not completed as of june  in addition the company increased reserves for inventory obsolescence from  at june  to  at june  this increase recognizes the obsolescence resulting from the rapidly changing technology of the industry that the company operates in and the value of older inventory  which the company maintains for support of long term maintenance contracts 
in april  the company obtained from crestar bank of maryland crestar a revolving credit facility line of credit providing for borrowings of up to million which expires december  borrowings under the line of credit are subject to approval by the bank and the bank has the right to refuse borrowing requests at any time 
interest on outstanding balances under the line of credit is payable monthly at the libor rate plus 
the line of credit is secured by the general assets of the company  requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including positive net income and minimum tangible net worth and  in the event of default  permits crestar to accelerate any outstanding obligations under the line of credit or under any other loans outstanding from crestar 
at september   the company s only borrowings under the line of credit were letters of credit in the aggregate amount of  see below 
in addition  the company has term loans outstanding from crestar in the aggregate principal amount of  at june  see below 
the company also maintains its cash at accounts with crestar 
crestar recently notified the company that it was in default of the line of credit as a result of the company s failure to comply with certain financial covenants 
the company is in the process of seeking alternative financing 
in the meantime  crestar has stated in writing  without waiving any of its rights  that it is not taking action to enforce its rights and remedies under the line of credit agreement 
however  if the borrowings outstanding under the line of credit ie the letters of credit and term loans are repaid in full on or before november   crestar has agreed to waive its right to collect approximately  in termination fees 
all amounts due under crestar borrowings are classified as current liabilities in the financial statements 
the company currently is actively seeking alternative financing to replace its line of credit 
george t 
jimenez  the chief executive officer of the company and a significant stockholder  has agreed that in the event that alternative financing can not be obtained in a timely manner and that  at any time during the next months the company s working capital becomes inadequate to support the business at its then current level  he will make available through a loan guarantee or a loan  for working capital in the principal amount of up to million less any amounts raised by the company after september  from financing activities or through the sale or pledge of assets 
such loan  if any would bear interest at prime plus  would be repayable out of the first alternate funding available to the company or upon a change of control  if any  and would be collateralized by the assets of the company 
in addition  mr 
jimenez has agreed to provide an unconditional guarantee  fully secured by cash or marketable securities  of the company s reimbursement obligation for any amounts paid by crestar in connection with a  letter of credit issued in connection with the company s lease of its headquarters building see below 
the company has agreed to reimburse mr 
jimenez for any amounts that he is required to pay under such guarantee 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and alternate sources of financing including the financing referred to above from mr 
jimenez will be sufficient to support the company s working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for working capital is dependent on the company s ability to increase sales and to receive from customers in a timely fashion adequate payments in connection with its contracts 
there is no assurance that such sales or payment levels will be achieved 
if cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy the company s working capital requirements  the company will be required to reduce expenses  raise additional funds through debt or equity financings or sales of assets and or consider strategic alternatives 
there can be no assurance that reductions in expenses would be achievable in a timely manner or  if achieved  that they would not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to generate revenues at the levels achieved to date 
further  there is no assurance that adequate additional funds will be available  in a timely manner or on terms favorable to the company

the letter of credit required under the lease for is  decreasing annually through to  the company maintains other letters of credit under its line of credit with crestar which at september  totaled  these letters of credit represent performance guarantees under the terms of contracts the company has entered into with several of its customers and expire through october  effect of new accounting pronouncements in october  the aicpa issued sop  software revenue recognition  which provides guidance in recognizing revenue on contracts with multiple elements including software licenses and services and superseded the previous authoritative literature sop 
sop is effective for the company for transactions entered into after june  in february  the aicpa proposed deferring  for one year  the implementation date for certain provisions of sop this standard is expected to result in more conservative revenue recognition on software transactions than was allowed under previous guidance 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
entitled disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which will become effective for the company s financial statements and will apply to quarterly reporting beginning in the first quarter of this statement may change the way public companies  having segments  report information about their business in annual financial statements and may require them to report selected segment information in their quarterly reports issued to stockholders

the company is currently evaluating reporting and disclosure requirements under this standard 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
entitled reporting comprehensive income  which will become effective for the company s year and will apply to quarterly reporting beginning in the first quarter of sfas no

additional factors affecting future operating results ace comm provides products to a technology driven industry sector 
therefore  ace comm s success is dependent in part upon factors beyond its control 
this report contains forward looking statements relating to the prospective operating results of the company 
the following are factors which could affect ace comm s future operating results 
these factors are intended to serve as a cautionary statement to statements that may be made  either verbally or in writing  including those in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of  the company to date  a significant portion of the company s revenue has been derived from substantial orders placed by large organizations 
the company expects that in the future it will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers in any given period for a significant portion of its revenue 
the company s future success may depend upon the continued demand by such customers for its products and services 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellation of orders 
sales to traditional carriers have provided and are expected to continue to provide substantial revenue 
the company s business is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry  in the united states and internationally  on the continued convergence of voice and data networks and on the evolution and widespread adoption of emerging network technologies 
any decline in the growth of the industry  the failure of these markets to converge or the failure of these network technologies to evolve or achieve widespread market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a key element of the company s business strategy is to develop strategic alliances with leading companies that provide telecommunications services or that manufacture and market network equipment in order to expand the company s distribution channels and enter new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase the number of  or to expand  these types of relationships  in order to market its products effectively  particularly internationally 
the company s growth has placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support continued growth of the company s operations 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  the quality of its products and services and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the new and emerging carrier market in the united states and overseas represents a source of growing demand for the company s products  software licenses and services 
in that this market segment is relatively new and in that many of these organizations are in the early stages of their development  financial resources may be limited and may adversely affect their ability to pay for the company s products  software licenses and services 
the company derived approximately million  or of its total revenues  from customers outside of the united states in the company anticipates that a significant amount of future revenues will be derived from sales to end users in asia  europe and other areas of the world 
these revenues may be adversely affected by the changing economic conditions in foreign countries  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to successfully develop new  and enhance existing  products  to service its customers  and to remain competitive depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
year the company has not completed a thorough assessment of the risks and costs associated with the year issue on internal hardware  software and non information technology systems nor has the company addressed year compliance of suppliers providing material incorporated into the company s products 
management believes that risks associated with year issues and related contingency plan arrangements will be resolved such that year issues are adequately mitigated and ongoing operations are not disrupted 
the company is establishing a program wherein systems will be assessed as to year compliance 
this assessment will include internal infrastructure  supplier readiness and product evaluation including information technology and non information technology systems and applications 
this assessment will include identifying areas of non compliance  plans to address known exposures  implementation of any system changes  validation of year compliance and contingencies to mitigate unknown risk 
the company has targeted year exposures to be identified and addressed no later than june attention and priority will be placed on those systems considered critical to the ongoing operations  requiring integration with other compliant systems and with longer lead time anticipated to remediate 
the cost of addressing the company s year issues has not been quantified  as assessment of year compliance has not been completed 
however  management is not aware of any year compliance exposures which would preclude ongoing operations during the next twelve months or which would result in material short term cash requirements 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the programs indicated in this section 
since the assessment is ongoing  the potential impact of these complications on the company s financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time 
if computer systems used by the company or its suppliers  the integrity of products provided to the company  or the software applications used in systems manufactured and sold by the company  fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year  the company s operations and financial results could be materially affected
