item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto of the company included herein 
overview datastream was incorporated in to develop  market  sell and support software products for the industrial automation market 
the company s revenues have grown each calendar year since inception 
excluding the one time charges related to the acquisition of sql  the company has been profitable in each of the last five years and has experienced a compounded annual growth rate of in revenues and in earnings during that period 
the company offers a complete family of cmms eams products to the mro industry 
see business products 
generally these products consist of major categories based on price and functionality 
maintainit and maintainit pro are off the shelf  entry level solutions for small to medium businesses 
mp professional is a full featured integrated maintenance system for small to mid size companies 
mp enterprise combines the benefits of pc servers and pc networks with a windows graphical user interface and sql relational database 
through the company s acquisition of sql in december  the company now also offers sql s mp formerly r camms  high end eams product 
datastream and sql support their software products through professional and support services 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
see note c of the company s financial statements for additional information concerning the company s revenue recognition policies 
until  the company concentrated its resources on developing microsoft dos windows compatible software for use on standalone computers or pc network systems 
recently  development efforts have focused on introducing enterprise wide windows client server products for oracle and microsoft sql server 
product development costs consist principally of salaries and certain other expenses related to development and modification of software products  which are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in the statement and ends when the resulting product is available for distribution 
annual amortization of capitalized product development costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than eighteen months or three years  depending on the product 
revenues from sales outside the united states were negligible until  when international revenues reached of total revenues 
international revenues increased to of total revenues in  and in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of sql 
management expects that international revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues  due to both sql  and to datastream s own internal expansion efforts 
on a pro forma basis  revenues adjusted for the inclusion of sql would have been approximately million 
of that figure  approximately would have been derived from international sources 
the company hedges against a defined range of movements in the exchange rates between the currencies in which it does virtually all its business 
as the company begins to accept increased payments in foreign currency  significant changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  gains and losses on currency translations could contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
see safe harbor statement risks associated with international sales 
the company s principal areas of operation include the united states and europe 
information about the company s operations in different geographic locations in is as follows united states europe total in thousands total revenues    operating income    identifiable assets    the united states operations include international revenues of approximately  for the year ended december  international revenues for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
many software companies experience seasonal variations in revenues 
the company has experienced twenty two consecutive quarters of increasing total revenues 
although this growth does not reflect seasonal variations in the company s operating results  the company believes that its future results of operations may be subject to quarterly variations 
the acquisition of sql has exposed the company to seasonal revenue fluctuations in europe  principally slower business conditions in the first and third quarters of the year 
datastream has historically experienced an increase in revenues in the quarter q and q during which the company holds its annual technical user group conference 
the next such conference is presently scheduled to be held in june although no assurance of such an increase in can be given 
because the company consummated the acquisition of sql on the last day of fiscal and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase  sql s results of operations for fiscal are not included in the company s fiscal results 
for  sql generated revenues of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million 
although the company has successfully integrated and rationalized sql s operations  the acquisition of sql has impacted and will continue to impact the reporting control and management capabilities of the company in see safe harbor statement impact of sql acquisition

total revenues for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  due principally to the impact of the acquisition of sql group  bv on december   introduction of foreign language versions of datastream s mp professional and maintainit pro in europe through the sql channels  continued acceptance of the company s products in the global industrial automation market  expansion of the company s sales  professional and technical support service organizations  introduction of mp enterprise in march  followed by translated versions catering to several european languages  introduction of requestlink in late and the expansion of the sales and marketing functions to support the company s telesales and direct sales programs 
the total growth in revenues of is comprised of a increase in datastream s revenues  an additional growth of attributable to the acquisition of sql and a growth in sql s revenues for fiscal total revenues for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  due principally to a number of factors  including the continued acceptance of the company s products in the industrial automation market  expansion of the company s sales  professional and technical support service organizations  introduction of mp for windows nt in june  introduction of maintainit pro in september  increased demand for the client server version of mp professional in the industrial automation market  and the addition of sales personnel and marketing resources to support the company s telesales and direct sales programs 
international revenues were approximately million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues  in product revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases are due to expansion of the number of software products being sold  growth in the number of software units sold  and an increase in the average selling price of the systems sold 
as a percentage of revenues  revenues from software products increased to in from in and decreased to in from in professional service revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases generally reflect the impact of the acquisition of sql  increased installation  training and integration services provided to support increased product sales 
as a percentage of revenues  revenues from professional services decreased slightly to in from in and increased to in from in technical support service revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases reflect the impact of the acquisition of sql and an increase in the type and variety of services provided to a larger installed customer base 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from technical support services decreased to in from in and in cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in and increased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of revenues in from and principally reflects decreased amortization of capitalized software costs as a percentage of product costs  the smaller component of product cost reflected in sql s product revenues  decreased costs associated with printing and replication of the company s software products  and volume discounts realized on shipping costs 
the slight increase as a percentage of revenues in from principally reflects increased amortization of capitalized software costs as a percentage of product costs 
cost of professional services increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in and in the increase as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to the acquisition of sql which experiences lower utilization of professional service personnel during the first and third quarters resulting from seasonal business cycles in europe 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to decreased utilization of engineers during the second half of the year resulting from increased hiring to support planned services growth 
cost of technical support services as a percentage of total revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase from to as a percentage of revenues reflects the impact of the acquisition of sql which sells larger contracts containing a larger component of technical support service cost 
cost of revenue in included a one time million write off of capitalized software which became obsolete as a result of the acquisition of sql see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
no such charges against income were taken in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  and increased to approximately million from approximately million in as a percentage of total revenues  these expenses were in  in and in the decrease as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to increased productivity of the sales and marketing staff combined with increased market acceptance of the company s products 
the increase as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to increased commissions and sales travel expenses 
product development expenses 
total expenditures on product development  including capitalized expenses  increased to approximately million in from approximately million in and from approximately million in the increases were primarily due to the hiring of additional employees and third party consultants to work on the company s file server  client server  maintainit pro and foreign language products 
the company capitalized software expense of approximately million  million and 
million  respectively  in  and  which represented  and of total expenditures for product development in the respective periods 
capitalization of software expense is expected to decrease as a percentage of total development expense in because the majority of projects qualifying for capitalization have been or will be released for revenue shipments in net product development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net product development expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized product development costs is charged to cost of product sales and totaled approximately million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
management believes that these capitalized software assets will be recoverable out of future product sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of the company s finance  human resources and information services 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in  due primarily to the acquisition of sql which historically spent more on general and administrative categories  increased administrative personnel required to support the company s growth  increased reserves and increased expenses associated with being a public company 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in write off of in process research and development costs 
the company expensed million of in process research and development acquired as part of the acquisition of sql 
also in conjunction with the acquisition of sql in  the company wrote off approximately million of capitalized software which represented investments in products rendered redundant or obsolete by the acquisition of the sql product line 
these one time charges resulted in the company reporting a loss in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other income decreased million in from approximately million in  after having increased approximately million in from approximately million in the decrease from to was primarily due to lower interest earned on smaller investment balances which resulted after remitting the cash portion of the purchase of sql to its shareholders 
the increase from to was due to the interest earned on higher investment balances realized upon completion of two public offerings of common stock in april and october  respectively 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate for increased to from in  primarily due to the tax treatment of the sql acquisition and related costs 
without the effect of the acquisition  the company s effective tax rate for would have been and the decrease from to could be attributed principally to increased product development tax credits 
likewise  the effective tax rate decrease from in to in  excluding the effects of the sql acquisition  was due primarily to increased development tax credits 
net income loss 
the company s net income increased in to approximately million or 
basic earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share from a loss of approximately million in  and decreased in to a loss of approximately million or basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share  from approximately million  or 
basic earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income is due to the impact of the acquisition of sql and internal growth of revenues during the loss in is directly attributable to the one time write off of costs associated with the acquisition of sql 
before accounting for the one time charges associated with the acquisition  the company s net income increased to million in quarterly results general 
many software companies experience seasonal variations in revenues 
the company has experienced twenty two consecutive quarters of increasing total revenues 
although this growth does not reflect seasonal variations in the company s operating results  the company believes that its future results of operations may be subject to quarterly variations 
the acquisition of sql has exposed the company to seasonal revenue fluctuations in europe  principally slower business conditions in the first and third quarters of the year 
datastream has historically experienced an increase in revenues in the quarter q and q during which the company holds its annual technical user group conference 
the next such conference is presently scheduled to be held in june although no assurance of such an increase in can be given

with respect to such forward looking statements  the company seeks the protections afforded by the private securities litigation reform act of the list set forth below is intended to identify certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements included elsewhere herein 
these factors are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business  and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements included elsewhere herein 
competition 
the current market for cmms eams software is both fragmented and highly competitive  and management expects competition to intensify as new companies enter the market and existing ones expand their product lines 
the company has entered into new markets at the low end of the market and  more importantly  at the high end of the market through both its introduction of an internally developed client server product line and through the acquisition of sql 
management expects the company to face increased competition across all products lines in the company s future performance is partially dependent upon the company s ability to respond to technological changes  evolving standards and its competitors innovations 
certain competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technical resources than datastream and sql 
effects of technological change and risks of product development 
the company s industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
datastream s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop new ones that address technological and market developments 
certain of the company s software research and development efforts are technologically challenging  and there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the resulting products will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on a limited number of products 
approximately of the company s revenues were derived from sales of the windows versions of sidearm  mp  maintainit  maintainit pro  mp professional  mp enterprise and mp and related services and support 
accordingly  the company s financial performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these products 
any factor adversely affecting sales of the company s products  such as delays in development  significant software flaws  negative product evaluations or incompatibility with significant hardware platforms could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risks associated with international sales 
international sales increased to of the company s revenues from in  and management expects that an increasing portion of the company s total revenues will be derived from international operations conducted in foreign currencies 
the company conducts virtually all its business in us dollars  dutch guilders  french francs and british pounds 
the company hedges exchange rate movements on either side of a locked in spot rate for movements within a range of on the dollar pound rate and on the dollar guilder rate 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the dollar beyond the ranges hedged by the company could affect datastream s results of operations and financial position  and gains and losses on currency translations could contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
in addition  the deeper exposure to international markets opens new areas with which the company is not familiar and places the company in competition with new vendors 
there is no assurance the company will be successful in its efforts to compete in these international markets 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
traditionally the company has operated with very little backlog  and a significant portion of datastream s revenues in any quarter were the result of a large number of relatively small orders received during a period 
accordingly  the company was subject to fluctuations in the number of overall orders in any given period  which in turn was influenced by the overall level of economic and industrial activity 
datastream establishes expense levels based in part on its expectations as to future net sales 
in addition  the acquisition of sql has given the company access to the market for high end maintenance software solutions  which generally take longer to implement and may result in a longer sales process 
the extended revenue recognition process may result in fluctuations in quarterly results 
if the company s revenues are below expectations  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
impact of sql acquisition 
the acquisition of sql has impacted and will continue to impact the reporting  control and management capabilities of the company 
while management believes it fully understands and can address the challenges encountered during the integration process  a number of aspects of sql s business cause management to recognize that it cannot provide assurance concerning the company s ability to maintain revenue or earnings growth in the future at the same levels that have been achieved historically 
these aspects include the global scope of sql operations  the fact this is the company s first major acquisition  the differences encountered in the high end markets in which sql competes  the seasonality of sql s revenues  and the fact that a disproportionate share of sql s sales occur at the end of each quarter and that the dollar amount of an sql transaction is substantially greater than the historical dollar amount of an average datastream transaction 
risks associated with the year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
there are several aspects to the year issue  as follows impact on revenue 
the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues in a variety of ways 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company 
conversely  year issues may cause other companies to accelerate purchases of software to replace non year compliant applications  causing a short term increase in demand for the company s products 
there is no assurance that such increase in demand will be realized  or that companies will resume purchases of the software offered by the company if and when they resolve their year problems 
either of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year compliance 
the company has obtained itaa year certification and believes that the current versions of its products are year compliant 
all datastream products use four digit years for all internal manipulations and representations 
the company regularly runs regression tests on its software  including tests of the year rollover 
based on the above  it is not expected that the company s products will be adversely affected by date changes in the year however  there can be no assurance that the company s products contain and will contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  distributors  resellers and systems integrators to be year compliant 
certain customers of the company may still be running earlier versions of two of the company s products  developed by the former sql  which earlier versions are not year compliant 
the company has informed these customers of the need to migrate to current products that management believes are year compliant and or has made available a software patch which management believes will brings these products into year compliance 
the company anticipates that generally throughout the software industry substantial litigation may be brought against software vendors of non compliant operating environments 
the company believes that any such claims against the company  with or without merit  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
internal systems 
the company has also reviewed its internal systems for year compliance and is in the process of upgrading to year compliant versions from third party software vendors  modifying certain systems  and planning to replace certain systems with new third party software  which the company expects to complete prior to january  in addition to making its own systems year ready  the company has also begun to contact its keys suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the systems of such suppliers and customers are year compliant and the extent to which the company could be affected by the failure of such third parties to be year compliant 
the company has created a year committee to coordinate the efforts to become fully year compliant 
management does not believe that the cost to bring its software products and internal systems into year compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  delays in upgrading some systems to year compliance  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems and in the systems of its vendors  customers and financial institutions could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the delivery or sale of products 
expenses related to year compliance 
the company has not incurred significant expense in becoming year compliant as this has been achieved as a part of regular upgrades to the internal operating systems 
future costs related to year compliance are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
as noted above  this brief summary of certain of the principal factors that may potentially influence the company s results of operations and financial conditions is not intended to be exhaustive  and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements made herein and in the company s publicly filed reports
