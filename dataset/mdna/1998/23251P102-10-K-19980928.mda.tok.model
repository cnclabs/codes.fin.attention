for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the business section and financial statement line item discussions set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
summary cyberonics was founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a novel therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological disorders 
clinical trials of the ncp system began with the first patient implant in november under an ide from the fda 
the company received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to aeds 
from inception through july  the company s primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the ncp system 
the company has had limited revenues to date and has been unprofitable since inception 
since inception  the company has incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities including product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities and manufacturing start up 
for the period from inception through june   the company incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
cyberonics was granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the ncp system in the member countries of the european union and also has permission to sell in certain other international markets 
however  through fiscal  the company devoted only limited resources to marketing and sales activities internationally  and only in early fiscal began initiating significant marketing and sales activities 
international sales of the ncp system have been limited to date 
cyberonics is engaged in obtaining reimbursement approvals from the various health care provider systems in the united states and in key international markets 
to date  the ncp system has been reimbursed by certain payors in the united states and by certain payment authorities in a limited number of international markets 
the company does not expect to achieve significant sales unless and until additional reimbursement approvals are obtained for the ncp system 
the company has made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the united states market launch of the ncp system and  to a lesser extent  in connection with efforts to expand its presence in international markets 
the company has not been profitable to date  and expects to remain unprofitable through at least fiscal moreover  the company expects to substantially increase the level operating expenses primarily sales and marketing and  to a lesser extent  clinical trial expenses through fiscal in an effort to accelerate the rate of market awareness and acceptance of the ncp system 
the company expects that there will be delays between the initiation of higher spending levels and increased revenues that may result from such increased spending 
moreover  once initiated  many of these expenses will be fixed in nature 
as a result  if revenues do not increase substantially over the levels achieved in recent periods  the company will continue to experience substantial operating losses  potentially at levels exceeding the levels experienced in recent periods  and the point at which the company achieves profitability would be delayed beyond the current expectations of securities analysts 
furthermore  even if the levels of revenues increase substantially  there can be no assurance that the company will become profitable when expected to do so or at all or  even if it becomes profitable  that it will remain so in future periods 
in addition to the foregoing  the company believes that its results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the extent to which the company s ncp system gains market acceptance  the extent to which third party payors approve reimbursement for the ncp system  the rate and size of expenditures incurred by the company as it expands its sales and marketing efforts  availability of key components  materials and contract services that may be dependent on the company s ability to forecast sales and ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended june  increased to million from million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
international sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  while domestic sales were million   and  in such respective periods 
the substantial increases in revenues in fiscal are primarily due to the company receiving fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july and the resulting initial year of sales into the united states market 
prior to receiving fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states  in fiscal and  the substantial majority of sales were derived from international markets where the company had regulatory approval to sell the ncp system 
domestic sales in such years were limited exclusively to reimbursements related to the company s clinical trial activities 
while the company expects to conduct additional clinical trial activities in the united states and internationally and may seek reimbursement in connection with such studies  the company does not expect such reimbursement revenues to be significant in future periods 
future increases in net sales will be dependent upon increased market acceptance for the ncp system and upon expanding its reimbursement from third party payors 
the company is devoting substantial resources to increasing the awareness and market acceptance of the ncp system  particularly in the united states 
the company believes  however  that there will be delays between increased sales and marketing activities and any resulting increase in revenues 
as a result  the company expects to achieve little  if any  quarter to quarter revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal furthermore  there can be no assurance that net sales levels in subsequent periods will increase at the rates experienced in recent periods or at all 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
the company s gross margin was for the year ended june   compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal is attributable primarily to the increase in net sales in the united states  which have higher gross margins than net sales in international markets  and a reduction in the royalty rate paid by the company from to of net sales 
the company is obligated to pay royalties at a rate of approximately of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between direct and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the ncp system s selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of both expenses related to the company s product and process development efforts  design efforts and expenses associated with conducting clinical trials and certain related regulatory activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  during the year ended june   compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal and million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in research and development spending in absolute amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects heightened levels of product design and development activity and manufacturing process improvement efforts  combined with increased clinical and regulatory staffing in preparation for future clinical study activities 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal over fiscal results from the rapid increase in sales following fda approval to sell the ncp system in the united states 
the decrease in research and development spending in absolute amount and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the company completing its confirmatory clinical trial during fiscal the company s confirmatory clinical trial was at its peak level of activity during fiscal the company intends to conduct further clinical trials of the ncp system for additional indications both within and outside the field of epilepsy 
accordingly  the company expects research and development expenses to fluctuate in both absolute amount and as a percent of net sales in future periods depending primarily upon the level of such clinical trial activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  during the year ended june   as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal and million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in the absolute amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in each year compared to the prior year was primarily due to sales and marketing activities focused on the united states market launch for the ncp system and to a lesser extent to the continued expansion of corporate infrastructure in response to the recent business expansion and movement of the company s headquarters to a new location 
the company began expanding its sales and marketing staff in late calendar to more actively pursue international sales and in early in anticipation of fda approval and commercial sales activities in the united states 
by the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company further expanded its sales and marketing staff in the united states from professionals to over professionals as of june  the company also expects to continue to add administrative personnel in response to the recent and potential future business expansion 
accordingly  the company expects its future selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute amount from the amounts incurred during fiscal in addition  the company expects such expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales in the near term as the company seeks to rapidly increase its sales and marketing activities and given the customary delays between increased sales and marketing expenditures and any increase in revenues 
interest income  net 
net interest income totaled million   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
interest income increased as a result of higher average cash and investment balances on hand due to investment of the proceeds from a private placement of common stock completed in march and from the company s follow on public equity offering completed in october the company expects interest and other income to gradually decline in absolute amount in future periods as the company utilizes its resources to fund future working capital requirements 
other expense income  net 
other income expense totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
for each of these years  other income expense consisted primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
the company expects other income expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon the mix between international and domestic business activities and upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
at june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire during the years through  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which expire during the years through due to its net operating loss history  to date the company has established a valuation allowance to fully offset its deferred tax assets  including those related to its carryforwards  resulting in no income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
current federal income tax regulations with respect to changes in ownership could limit the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of its securities 
the company had no short or long term borrowings outstanding at june   and had no credit facilities available at that time 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs related to sales and marketing activities associated with united states and international sales and marketing activities  expansion of manufacturing capabilities  clinical trials and regulatory activities and product and process development 
the amount and timing of anticipated expenditures will depend upon numerous factors both within and outside of the company s control  including the nature and timing of marketing and sales activities and the nature and timing of additional clinical trials for additional indications  both within and outside the field of epilepsy 
moreover  the company s ability to generate income from operations will be dependent upon maintaining and broadening reimbursement approval from government and third party payors as well as receiving market acceptance for the ncp system 
during fiscal  the company used approximately million in cash in operating activities 
during the fiscal year  inventories increased to million at june  from million at june  as the company built inventory levels in anticipation of higher levels of manufacturing and sales activities 
the company also used approximately million to purchase capital equipment for its new administrative and manufacturing facility 
during fiscal  the company raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a public equity offering and received additional proceeds of approximately million related to issuance of its shares  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
the company s liquidity will continue to be reduced as amounts are expended for expansion of sales and marketing activities  manufacturing expansion  continuing clinical trials and related regulatory affairs  product and process development and infrastructure development 
although the company has no firm commitments  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities and to enhance general infrastructure and facilities 
the company believes that its current resources will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through june  this estimate is based on certain assumptions  which may not hold true 
there can be no assurance that the company s available cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and investment income  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through june  the availability of financing either before or after that time will depend upon a number of important factors  including the state of the united states capital markets and economy in general and the health care and medical device segments in particular  the status of the company s international and domestic sales activities and the status of the company s clinical and regulatory activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital when needed or that the terms upon which capital will be available will be favorable to the company 
impact of new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
impact of year many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result these computer systems and software products have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  to send invoices  or to engage in similar normal business activities 
finally  computer systems and software products devices may fail to process accurately leap year logic associated with the year state of readiness the company believes that the adverse impact of year issues on its internal computer systems will not be material 
most of the personal computers and computer systems used by the company have been installed in the past three years  primarily in the past year as the company has been growing its organization 
the company has also recently moved most of its organization to a new facility in houston  texas  and has installed new equipment in connection with such relocation 
the company has conducted a manual review of all of its software  except for its manufacturing systems and the telephone system at its webster manufacturing facility  and found the incidence of year coding issues to be minimal 
the company continues to manufacture the ncp system at its webster  texas facility  but is in the process of establishing manufacturing capacity at the houston facility  which is expected to be completed in fiscal the company is in the process of evaluating its manufacturing software for year compliance  including systems used at the webster facility as well as the systems being implemented at the houston facility  however  it does not expect that any necessary changes to its software will be material 
in addition  if the company continues to manufacture its product at the webster facility  it intends to test the telephone system at that location to determine if it is year compliant 
the company has also contacted each of its material vendors and suppliers to determine if such vendors or suppliers have any year compliance issues that have not been resolved  or may not be resolved in a timely manner 
the company s software used by customers to program the ncp generator does not utilize dating in its processing calculations 
costs of year compliance the company does not expect expenditures for upgrades and testing for year issues of software used on internal systems to be material 
to date  any such costs incurred have been in connection with the implementation of systems at its new facility and the purchase of equipment and software for its growing employee base 
the company estimates that  in the worst case  it may have to upgrade certain of its manufacturing databases  replace the telephone system at the webster location  and replace certain older personal computers currently being used 
the costs of such activities are estimated to be under  the company expects to complete its testing  and any required upgrades by mid calendar the company also does not expect diversion of resources from other management information systems or manufacturing projects will have a material adverse impact on the company 
risks of year non compliance and contingency plans in the event of a failure of any software or other electronic devices used for the company s internal systems  the company believes any resulting business disruption would not have a material adverse effect on the company  because the company believes alternative  less technologically advanced  systems would be available 
the company is also contacting its vendors and suppliers currently to determine if a further contingency plan will be needed to ensure timely receipt of materials and services from such vendors and suppliers 
the costs of the modifications and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications  if any  are based on management s estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate an correct all relevant computer code  and similar uncertainties 
factors affecting future operating results reliance on single product 
the company has only one product  the ncp system  which has been approved by the fda only for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to aeds 
the company does not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the ncp system for the foreseeable future 
although the company has been able to sell the ncp system in certain countries in europe since and in the united states and canada since mid  it is only now in the process of initiating full scale marketing and sales efforts in the united states and other countries 
the company s inability to commercialize successfully the ncp system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
continued market acceptance of the company s ncp system will depend on the company s ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the ncp system  and on the approval and availability of adequate levels of reimbursement 
while the ncp system has been used in approximately  patients through june   it provides a new form of therapy with which many physicians are unfamiliar 
the company believes that existing aeds and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the ncp system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
such therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the ncp system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
there can be no assurance that the ncp system will achieve market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication or that adequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or third party payors will be available 
failure of the ncp system to gain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of losses  profitability uncertain  fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately million through june  in july  the company received fda marketing approval which permits the company to sell the ncp system in the united states for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of refractory partial onset seizures in patients over twelve years of age 
in addition  the company has obtained ce marking  the designation of market approval now accepted by all european union member countries  for its ncp system which  when combined with approvals from canada and certain other countries  permits the company to sell the ncp system internationally 
even with these marketing approvals  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate adequate sales to achieve profitability in the future 
in addition  in order to develop these markets  the company will incur substantial marketing and sales expenses 
the amount and timing of anticipated expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the nature and timing of marketing and sales activities  the expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities  the nature and timing of additional clinical trials  and the company s product development efforts 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the extent to which the company s ncp system gains market acceptance  timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payors  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its sales and marketing efforts and availability of key components  materials and contract services which may be dependent on the company s ability to forecast sales 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
the company s ability to commercialize the ncp system successfully will depend in part on whether third party payors  including private health care insurers  managed care plans  the united states government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the ncp system and the procedures and services associated therewith  and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the ncp system and the related services 
in deciding to cover a new therapy  third party payors base their initial coverage decisions on several factors including  but not limited to  the status of the fda s review of the product  the product s safety and efficacy  the number of studies performed and peer reviewed articles published with respect to the product and how the product and therapy compares to alternative therapies 
there can be no assurance that third party payors will view the company and the ncp system favorably with respect to any of the above factors 
the company has only limited experience in seeking and obtaining coverage decisions from third party payors 
a failure to achieve favorable coverage decisions for the ncp system in a timely manner could deter patients and their physicians from using the ncp system and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
once a favorable coverage determination is made with respect to a product  payors must determine the level of reimbursement for the product and related therapy and procedures 
in making decisions about reimbursement amounts  third party private payors typically reimburse for the costs of newly covered devices and services using the standard methods they employ for other products and services already covered 
many private insurers and managed care plans use a variety of payment mechanisms  including  but not limited to  discounted charges  per diem amounts  resource based payment scales and reimbursed costs 
the company believes that a significant number of epilepsy patients in the united states are either eligible for benefits under the medicare program or are uninsured 
the medicare program uses different payment mechanisms to reimburse for procedures performed in different settings 
for outpatient implants  medicare uses a system that reimburses hospitals based on their costs 
the company believes that those payments generally are adequate 
for inpatient implants  medicare uses a fixed payment method based on diagnosis related groups or drgs 
under current drg groupings  hospital inpatient procedures for implanting the ncp system are assigned to one of two different drgs based on whether or not the patient has complications or comorbidities coexisting severe medical problems 
the drg grouping that would include implantation of the ncp system for patients without complications or comorbidities pays hospitals less than the costs of purchasing and implanting the ncp system 
the company believes that this drg grouping would apply to most of the epilepsy patients covered by medicare 
in order to assure adequate reimbursement for all epileptic patients eligible for benefits under medicare  the company may seek changes in the drg grouping so that ncp system implant cases would be reclassified to other  higher paying drgs 
the company has only limited experience in seeking and obtaining coverage and payment approvals from third party payors  and there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in achieving coverage or adequate reimbursement levels  or that it can obtain new drg assignments under the medicare program to cover the complete costs of therapy using the ncp system 
if the company is unsuccessful in achieving coverage or adequate reimbursement levels or in obtaining new drg assignments  or if hospitals or physicians view their payments as inadequate  then patients  physicians and hospitals could be deterred from using the ncp system  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
medicare uses a resource based relative value scale to pay for physicians services 
the company believes that the relative value scales for the surgeons and physicians involved in the implantation and interrogation and reprogramming of the ncp system provide adequate reimbursement for these physicians services 
see business third party reimbursement 
in june  the company was granted approval to use the ce mark and to market the ncp system in the european union 
the company is continuing to pursue appropriate reimbursement approvals in the european union member countries 
the company believes that significant sales volume will be difficult to generate without appropriate reimbursement approvals 
there can be no assurance as to when or whether such reimbursement will be obtained in any of the european union countries or  if obtained  whether the levels of reimbursement will be sufficient to enable the company to sell the ncp system on a profitable basis 
limited marketing and sales experience 
although the company has had approval to market the ncp system in the member countries of the european union since  it has only recently received fda approval to commercialize the ncp system in the united states and  consequently  it has limited experience in marketing  direct sales and distribution 
the company has recently expanded its marketing and sales force for the united states market  but no assurance can be given that this expanded direct marketing and sales force will succeed in promoting the ncp system to patients  health care providers or third party payors on a broad basis 
the company believes that  to market its products directly  it must employ a multidisciplinary marketing and sales force with medical device sales experience  clinical experience with epilepsy  experience in obtaining reimbursement for new medical technologies and experience with peer to peer marketing programs 
in addition  due to the limited market awareness of the ncp system  the company believes that the sales process could be lengthy  requiring the company to educate patients  health care providers and third party payors regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the ncp system 
in certain international territories  the company relies  and intends to continue relying  upon independent distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel or foreign distributors  or that the company s marketing efforts will be successful 
failure by the company to successfully market the ncp system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business marketing and sales 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company has a limited history of operations that  to date  has consisted primarily of manufacturing limited quantities of the ncp system for clinical investigations  for first year commercial sales activities in the united states and for commercial sales activities in international markets 
the company does not have experience manufacturing the ncp system in the volumes that will be necessary to achieve significant commercial sales 
in addition to its existing manufacturing facility  the company entered into a lease for a new headquarters and manufacturing facility  and is in the process of moving its manufacturing operations to the new facility  which is expected to begin production in calendar the company may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of the ncp system  in procuring the necessary supply of materials  components and contract services  or in hiring and training additional manufacturing personnel to support domestic and international demand 
the company will be required to obtain fda approval for its change in the manufacturing facility 
the new manufacturing facility will also have to be inspected for compliance with the fda s quality system regulations qsr and with iso and standards  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements with respect to device design  development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities  before the company can begin commercial scale production of the ncp system at the new manufacturing facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary fda and other approvals for its new facilities on a timely basis  or at all 
if the company is unable to achieve commercial scale production capability on a timely basis with acceptable quality an manufacturing yield and costs  to sustain such capacity  or to achieve fda and other governmental approvals  the ability of the company to deliver products on a timely basis could be impaired which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business manufacturing and sources of supply 
dependence on key suppliers and manufacturers 
the company relies upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the ncp system 
the company periodically experiences discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require qualification of alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  product design changes 
the company believes that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the ncp system  when necessary  could consume significant company resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions 
these delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture the ncp system on a timely and cost competitive basis  and therefore on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business manufacturing and sources of supply 
risk of product recall 
the ncp system includes a complex electronic device and lead designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition in patients 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse reactions could result in a recall of the company s products  possibly requiring removal and potentially reimplantation of ncp generators and or leads 
in  a failure of an ncp system caused permanent paralysis of one patient s left vocal cord 
in addition  several patients experienced vagus nerve lead failures which  although not harmful to the patient  reduced the efficacy of the treatment and required lead replacement 
since the occurrence of these failures  changes have been made to the company s product designs and no similar failures have been reported to the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience similar or other product problems or that the company will not be required to recall products 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business clinical trials and government regulation 
dependence on patents  licenses and proprietary rights 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the ncp system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  the company has acquired licenses under certain patents and has patented and intends to continue to seek patents on its own inventions used in its products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and there can be no assurance that patents will issue from the currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of the company s technology  or any commercial advantage to the company 
cyberonics believes that the licenses held by the company provide it with protection in the united states in the field of cranial nerve stimulation  including vagus nerve stimulation for the control of epilepsy  movement disorders  including parkinson s disease and essential tremor  and additional indications for which method patents have been issued 
the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed united states patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
in addition  there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using the ncp system  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that any required license would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
see business patents  licenses and proprietary rights 
competition  rapid technological change 
the company believes that existing and future aeds will be the primary competition for its ncp system 
the company may also face competition from other medical device companies for the treatment of partial seizures 
medtronic  inc continues to clinically assess an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe thalamic stimulator for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
the company could also face competition from other large medical device companies which have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than the company and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than the company s current or future products 
there can also be no assurance that advancements in surgical techniques will not make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel aeds  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the ncp system non competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competition  including the development and commercialization of new products and technology  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business competition 
management of growth 
in connection with the commercialization of the ncp system in the united states  the company has begun and intends to continue to significantly expand the scope of its operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on the company s resources and operations 
the company s ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon its ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
the company s success will also depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve its operational  management information and financial control systems  of which there can be no assurance 
the company s inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business employees 
product liability and availability of insurance 
the manufacture and sale of the ncp system entails the risk of product liability claims 
although the company maintains product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business product liability and insurance 
government regulation 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the ncp system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the united states by federal agencies  primarily the fda  and by comparable state agencies 
the ncp system is regulated as a medical device by the fda and is subject to the fda s premarket approval pma requirements 
in july  the company received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to aeds 
nonetheless  in the future  it will be necessary for the company to file pma supplements  and apply for additional regulatory approvals  possibly including new investigational device exemptions ides and additional pmas  for other applications of the ncp system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent the company from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the ncp system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

although the company believes that its current resources will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements at least through june   there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing either before or after that date 
this estimate is based on certain assumptions  which may not hold true 
there can be no assurance that the company s available cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and investment income  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through june  the company s future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent and timing of future product sales  the scale up of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the nature  timing and success of clinical trials for additional indications for the ncp system 
such financing  if required  may not be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
lack of access to sufficient financing would impair the company s ability to fully pursue its business objectives  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks associated with international operations 
although the ncp system has been approved for commercialization in the european union countries since  the company has not generated significant revenues from such countries to date 
the company currently is expanding its marketing and sales activities in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully increase international sales or that the company will be successful in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
changes in overseas economic conditions  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws  or tariffs or other trade regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the anticipated international nature of the company s business is also expected to subject the company and its representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate or where the ncp system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for the treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy
