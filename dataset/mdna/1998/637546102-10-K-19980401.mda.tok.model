item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
results of operations consolidated results of operations consolidated net income from the national security group was million in  more than double the results of million 
net income from was up over million from the total of  earnings per share were in compared to 
in  and 
in the increase in net income is primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses and an increase in realized capital gains from the sale of common stock investments which have flourished in the current bull market 
consolidated revenues grew to million compared to million in revenues in increased million from million in revenue increases are primarily due to growth in the property casualty subsidiaries private passenger automobile programs in louisiana and georgia 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other is summarized as follows premium revenues life and accident and health insurance    property and casualty insurance 
   income before taxes and cumulative effect adjustment life and accident and health insurance   property and casualty insurance 
  other life and accident and health insurance operations pretax earnings in of million were significantly better than earnings of million 
there was a pretax loss in of  the primary factor contributing to the improvement in earnings was a reduction in litigation expenses 
in litigation expenses were only  compared to  in litigation expenses in were million 
also contributing to the increase in earnings was realized capital gains which increased over  in compared to premium income  which totaled million in  has declined gradually over the last five years and has decreased by over this period of time 
the reduction in premium income is due to a reduction in the number of sales agents 
the number of sales agents has declined by over the last five years to the current total of premium income decreased  to million in compared to premium income of million 
premium income in was down  from the total in of million 
a new agents contract which became effective january  is expected to improve retention of premiums 
also  new products and distribution methods will be introduced in which is expected to improve prospects for future premium growth 
the decrease in the agency force has reduced sales commissions and general expenses for field operations which has reduced expenses as a percent of premium income 
administrative and tax expenses have also decreased from last year 
property casualty operations pretax earnings were million in  a increase over pretax earnings of million 
pretax earnings in were up compared to  in the low valued dwelling fire and extended coverage program lvd was much improved in the lvd program incurred a greater than normal amount of fire and windstorm losses in  and was hit by hurricane opal in which reduced earnings by million 
unfortunately the improved results in the lvd program were offset by adverse loss development in the automobile programs in georgia and louisiana 
the property casualty subsidiary attempted to obtain rate increases in louisiana due to the adverse loss development  but the rate filings were denied by the state insurance rating bureau 
due to the failed attempts to adjust rates  the louisiana automobile program will be discontinued in a rate increase was granted in the state of georgia  and more stringent underwriting guidelines have been implemented so this program will continue  but will be monitored closely for signs of improvement 
the primary reason for the improvement in earnings was the capital gains realized from the sale of common stock investments 
a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the statutory combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums written during the year 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the combined ratio for did not improve compared to due to increased losses in the private passenger automobile programs 
the low value dwelling program loss ratio improved greatly in but was offset by the increase in automobile losses 
the combined ratio for  though improved over was still higher than historical averages for the property casualty subsidiaries 
the primary reason for the high combined ratio was higher than normal incurred losses in the low value dwelling program in the first quarter of these losses were attributable to the colder than normal winter which led to more fire losses and several tornado producing storms which hit the southeastern united states 
the combined ratio for was abnormally high due to losses sustained in hurricane opal 
maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane  such as opal  hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the fire casualty subsidiary maintains catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
premium income increased to million verses million in which increased from million in the premium growth came primarily from automobile programs in louisiana and georgia 
as mentioned above  a louisiana automobile program was discontinued in february because of unfavorable underwriting experience and a proposed rate increase being denied 
to help offset this loss of premium  a florida automobile and a louisiana mobile homeowners program began in asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents of total svo class moody s standard and poor s bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c c ci to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
the company limits the extent of its credit risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are guaranteed by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities provided used cash of million  million  million in   and respectively 
those statements also classify the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities  and financing activities and disclose the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet the company s obligations 
an increase in profits of million  and a large decrease in reinsurance recoveries of million are the major causes of a million increase in cash provided from operations in the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operating activities for was the increased cash flow from the new automobile programs 
the primary reason for the large increase in cash used for operating activities in was hurricane opal which hit alabama in early october 
the cash provided from the sale of available for sale securities helped offset the increase in cash required to pay hurricane claims 
the company has standby letters of credit of less than  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
the letters of credit are secured by certain invested assets of the company 
the company also routinely incurs liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
the company has long term debt of  at december  the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect in its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and million in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula will be used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of five to one at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
year issue the year issue relates to computer system programs which may not properly recognize the change in date years from to as a result of this time sensitivity of existing software  any business entity is at risk for possible system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send billings  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is currently modifying significant portions of its computer programs so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to the year date recognition 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software  the year issue will not pose a significant operational problem 
however  if such modifications are not made  or not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company is utilizing internal resources to reprogram and test software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project no later than june  the total cost of the year project is not material to the financial results of the company
