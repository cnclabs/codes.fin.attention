item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading cro providing a wide range of integrated product development services on a worldwide basis to the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
in addition  and to a lesser extent  covance also provides services such as health economics and outcomes for managed care organizations  hospitals and other health care providers and laboratory testing services to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services can be broadly classified into two lines of business early development services preclinical  phase i and biomanufacturing and late stage development services clinical and periapproval  central laboratory  pharmaceutical packaging and health economics and outcomes 
covance believes it is one of the largest biopharmaceutical cros  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that are capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to reduce product development time  allowing them to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and thus  maximize the period of marketing exclusivity and monetary return on their investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provide clients with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
the operations that today constitute covance were acquired by corning  starting in  as part of a strategy to create a global  integrated and full service product development company 
in keeping with this strategy  during the period through the present  covance has acquired three new operations and formed a major new business venture 
specifically  in january  covance expanded its offering of value added product development services with the acquisition of national packaging systems  inc  a pharmaceutical packaging company  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
in february  covance formed covance biotechnology  a majority owned company which has enabled covance to engage in the manufacture of biologics since the facility began operations in december in recognition of the rapid changes in the biopharmaceutical industry s marketplace  particularly the need for the industry to further demonstrate the benefits and cost effectiveness of their products to payors  covance purchased in march all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of health technology associates  inc hta  a health economics and outcomes company  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
in october  covance expanded its pharmaceutical packaging capabilities to europe with the purchase of swiss based crs pacamed ag  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
in addition  covance acquired a  square foot facility in horsham  united kingdom  which is used to provide  among other things  pharmaceutical packaging services in europe 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts which generally range in duration from a few months to two years 
revenue from these contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of the relationship between costs incurred and estimated total costs 
typically  covance s contracts are either fixed price  fee for service or fee for service with a cap 
the contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation for cost overruns arising from changes in the level of work scope 
renegotiated amounts are included in net revenues when earned and realization is assured 
in some cases  for multi year contracts a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated  with performance based installments payable over the contract duration as milestones are achieved 
covance routinely subcontracts with independent physician investigators in connection with multi site clinical trials 
investigator fees are not reflected in net revenues or expenses since such fees are granted by customers on a pass through basis without risk or reward to covance 
while most contracts are terminable either immediately or upon notice by the client  they typically require payment of expenses to wind down a study  payment of fees earned to date  and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment of some portion of the fees or profit that could have been earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
covance s cost of revenue includes appropriate amounts necessary to complete the revenue and earnings process  and includes direct labor and related benefit charges  other direct costs and allocable expenses including indirect labor  facility charges and information technology costs 
these costs  as a percentage of net revenues  tend to fluctuate from one period to another generally within a range of up to basis points in either direction  principally as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
accordingly  changes in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenues plus or minus basis points can be experienced from one period to another

cost of revenue increased to million for from million for as a result of the increase in net revenues 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  increased to for from for this increase is primarily attributable to covance s biomanufacturing operations 
during the first eleven months of  all costs incurred in covance s biomanufacturing operations were of an administrative nature as the biomanufacturing facility was being prepared for revenue producing operations which began in december

the shift in expenses in covance s biomanufacturing operations  as discussed above  accounts for most of the reduction in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues for compared to second  as a wholly owned business of corning  certain administrative activities were historically performed on covance s behalf by corning 
charges incurred for these services totaled million  or of net revenues  in while these charges are no longer incurred as a result of covance s spin off from corning  they have been substantially  but not entirely  replaced by internal costs as additional resources continue to be added to perform the services previously provided by corning  as well as to perform functions new to covance as a separate publicly traded company

net income decreased to million for from million for excluding the after tax impact of the spin off related charge and restructuring provision  net income increased million or to million from million for quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination of drug development trials  acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of studies or trials are often the result of actions taken by clients or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  minor variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results of covance for each of the eight most recent fiscal quarters during the period ended december  in the opinion of covance  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited covance consolidated financial statements and reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for those periods

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized domestic cash management function whereby cash received from operations is generally swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account 
cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
from time to time excess cash balances are maintained at covance  generally for specific cash requirements 
in november  covance borrowed million under a newly established five year million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility to repay corning and affiliates for all intercompany borrowings and income tax liabilities existing at that time 
at december   there was million of outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in a remaining availability of million under the credit facility 
covance has several different interest rate options available to it under the credit facility 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility during was computed based upon the london interbank offered rate plus a margin and approximated per annum 
the credit facility expires in november and contains various covenants which  among other things  may restrict covance from engaging in certain financing activities and prohibits covance from paying cash dividends on the covance common stock during a default or an event of default  as defined in the credit facility  or if after giving effect to the payment of such dividends covance would not be in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
as of december   covance biotechnology had million in long term debt outstanding with the north carolina biotechnology center 
this debt matures in december and is guaranteed by covance 
in addition  covance biotechnology has a million short term revolving credit facility with a bank  of which million of borrowings were outstanding as of december  this short term revolving credit facility carries interest at a rate substantially equivalent to the rate in effect on covance s borrowings under the credit facility and is guaranteed by covance 
in october  a foreign subsidiary of covance borrowed million swiss francs from a bank 
this loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures in three years 
in connection with the loan  covance provided a letter of credit in favor of the lender which may be drawn upon in event of default 
this letter of credit carries a variable cost which is presently basis points per annum 
these funds were used to repay certain cross currency intercompany obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
covance s primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that the credit facility will provide covance with sufficient financial flexibility and ready access to cash on both a short term and a long term basis to fund  as required  capital expenditures  potential future acquisitions and other longer term growth opportunities 
during the year ended december   covance s operations provided net cash of million  an increase of million from the corresponding amount 
cash flows from net earnings adjusted for non cash activity provided million during  up million or from the corresponding amount of million 
the change in net operating assets used million in cash during while this net change used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in accounts and unbilled receivables 
covance s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  investing activities for the years ended december  and included capital spending to expand existing operations and purchase equipment to enhance scientific technology capabilities 
investing activities for the year ended december  also included acquisitions 
in march  covance acquired health technology associates  inc for a cash payment of approximately million 
in october  covance acquired crs pacamed ag for a cash payment of approximately million 
in october  covance also acquired a new facility which is used to provide  among other things  pharmaceutical packaging services in europe for a cash payment of approximately million 
also in october  covance paid million in contingent purchase price in connection with its acquisition of national packaging systems  inc during and  covance spent approximately million and million excluding the october facility purchase of million  respectively  on capital expenditures for maintenance and upgrade of existing equipment  outfitting of new facilities and computer equipment and software for newly hired employees 
as described in note to the audited covance consolidated financial statements  a covance subsidiary  covance biotechnology  entered into an operating lease arrangement in june whereby a custom designed  fully equipped facility was constructed 
the lease  which commenced in december upon completion of construction of the facility  requires minimum annual lease payments of approximately million 
foreign currency since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical and periapproval services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
while some contracts provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed are the responsibility of the customer and others provide that currency fluctuations from the rates in effect at the time the contract is executed up to a specified threshold generally plus or minus a few percentage points are absorbed by covance while fluctuations in excess of the threshold are the customer s responsibility  most contracts do not specifically address responsibility for currency fluctuations 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to covance s consolidated financial position 
taxes since covance conducts operations on a global basis  covance s effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions 
see note to the audited covance consolidated financial statements 
inflation while most of covance s net revenues are earned under contracts  the long term contracts those in excess of one year generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  covance believes that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition 
year information systems are an integral part of the services and products covance provides 
the company has formed a group  led by its chief information officer  to assess the year issue from an internal  supplier and customer perspective 
presently  this group consists of thirteen individuals who are dedicated full time to the year project 
covance plans to add six individuals to this group during covance s year plan will have risk assessment  evaluation and remediation schedules finalized during for business critical systems  remediation  validation and implementation is already underway 
this plan is being executed under the guidance of covance s senior management  who will receive periodic progress reports from the group 
although the company believes at this time that neither the costs nor expenses of the year issue will be material to the company  the ultimate costs and expenses are currently unknown and such costs or the consequences of failure to correct any year issues could have a material impact on covance s financial conditions  business or operations
