in september  the company announced that it intended to divest its food processing operations 
as a consequence  beginning in november  the company began accounting for the food processing segment as a discontinued operation

earnings loss from discontinued operations 
net earnings loss fiscal compared to fiscal outlook group net sales from continuing operations were million for fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal sales of million 
the major factor for this decline is the loss of sales from its barrier films corp 
barrier subsidiary 
barrier  sold in may  had net sales of million in fiscal the company was able to offset the lost revenue from this subsidiary by focusing its efforts on new markets for its core production competencies as well as acquiring a book of business from general converting in its packaging operations  which accounted for million of sales in fiscal the company also experienced a million gain in its sales of paperboard cartons 
sales decreases of approximately million occurred in direct mail and specialty printing services 
company sales related to sports and other collectible picture cards remained insignificant 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit increased million over to million 
this improvement resulted from more efficient utilization of material and personnel reductions 
reduced material costs resulted from continuing programs developed to more effectively utilize material and reduce scrap 
in addition  sales with relatively less material costs increased as a percentage of sales 
surplus equipment that had previously been utilized primarily for the sports and collectible picture card market were put to alternative use or were sold 
inventory write offs were approximately  in both fiscal and fiscal management has developed a program to further reduce inventory to desired levels and does not currently believe that additional material costs will be incurred on the disposition 
however  actual results will be determined by the ability to attract buyers or use materials in the normal course of business 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in fiscal and represent of net sales as compared to in the prior year 
increases are attributable to increased expenses related to an expanded sales force and increases in professional service expenses related to divestitures  acquisitions  and sale of operating assets 
this included approximately  of expenses related in the proposed sale of the company 
interest expense as a percent of net sales decreased to in fiscal versus in fiscal interest expense decreased  from due to the decrease in total debt 
because a significant portion of the debt was not repaid until the may sale of outlook foods  the reduction of interest paid in fiscal was not as great relative to the total reduction of debt 
other income increased to million or of sales in fiscal as compared to of sales in fiscal of this amount  approximately million represents gains on the sale of fixed assets  including the land  building and equipment related to fulfillment operations located in oshkosh  wisconsin 
continuing fulfillment operations have been moved to the company s neenah facility 
fiscal pretax earnings from continuing operations of million represent a million improvement in pretax earnings from continuing operations compared to fiscal pretax income from continuing operations was of net sales in fiscal as compared to a pretax loss from continuing operations of in fiscal the company recorded a tax provision of  or of net sales  that also included an adjustment to the deferred tax liability accounts 
outlook foods  accounted for as a discontinued operation  was sold as of may  the company had announced its intention to divest foods in september  since that time  the company has accounted for its food processing operations as a discontinued operation 
a loss of approximately  was realized as a result of this transaction 
up to may  the foods operations generated million of sales and  of pretax loss 
discontinued operations resulted in an approximately  net loss in both fiscal and fiscal in summary  fiscal yielded a net loss of per share  comprised of earnings from continuing operations of per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of per share 
fiscal yielded a net loss of per share  comprised of a net loss from continuing operations of per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of per share 
general factors because of the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest customers have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these customers 
during fiscal  sales primarily in the discontinued food processing operations to nestle beverage company and its affiliates nestle accounted for of the company s total net sales for the period 
sales to nestle were and of the company s total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  sales all graphic services to kraft foods  inc and affiliates kraft accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales from continuing operations for the period  sales to kraft were and of the company s total net sales from continuing operations in fiscal and  respectively 
changes in the company s project mix and timing of projects make predictability of the company s future results very difficult 
additional changes in the company s project mix and customer base could affect future sales volume and profitability 
the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects undertaken for certain customers 
futhermore  the company s largest customers may vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for such customers 
the loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the number or character of projects for particular customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
customers generally purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts  although exceptions sometimes occur when the company is required to purchase substantial inventories or special machinery to meet orders 
the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  although it increases the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services  and manufacture its products 
therefore  the company is dependent upon the functioning of such machinery  and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment
