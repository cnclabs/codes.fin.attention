if the value of the canadian dollar falls against the us dollar  the cost of sales of the company will increase thereby reducing the company s gross profit and net income 
conversely  if the value of the canadian dollar rises against the us dollar  gross profit and net income will increase 
year the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits  rather than four  to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
in addition  similar problems may arise in some systems which use certain dates in to represent something other than a date 
the effects of the year issue may be experienced before  on  or after january   and if not addressed  the impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to significant systems failure  which could affect an entity s ability to conduct normal business operations 
it is not possible to be certain that all aspects of the year issue affecting the entity  including those relating to the efforts of customers  suppliers  or other third parties  will be fully resolved
