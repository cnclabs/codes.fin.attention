net sales in were  compared to  in  an increase of 
this sales increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of five vgc corporation locations in  one in august and four in november excluding the impact of the vgc acquisition  sales increased modestly  although there were fluctuations between geographic locations 
in  the company established a systems group to service the digital electronic component of the market 
although this group will work closely with the local distribution centers  the group is structured based on distinct products with a separate staff with technical expertise to provide workflow analysis  and installation  training and service  to more effectively meet customer requirements 
included in this reorganization is the centralization of the electronics inventory in two primary locations  eliminating the duplication of demonstration and other electronics inventory at each of the company s branches 
in conjunction with this centralization and new distribution approach  the company expensed million to cost of sales for the write down of the existing branch inventory to current market value 
this charge to cost of sales resulted in the gross profit percent decreasing from in to in excluding this charge  the gross profit percent would have been  the same as in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased from in to in the company benefited by the economies of merging the vgc business into the existing business  plus the continued efforts to reduce costs within the company 
these gains were partially offset by additional staffing required for the new systems division 
the company expects increased sales and gross margins in to justify these additional expenses 
in  the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to  from  in the company has continued to benefit from more stringent credit requirements which were initially implemented in interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase is primarily due to the debt associated with the acquisition of vgc 
in  the company sold its interest in a capital lease in the los angeles  california area for a gain of approximately million 
the lease rents were significantly lower than the existing market  which resulted in the market value for the lease 
from a company operating standpoint  the facility was substantially larger than what was required for the company s operations 
subsequent to the sale  the company moved its los angeles operations to a facility of appropriate size for the areas operations 
in addition  in  the company sold its pressroom material converting operation  which consisted primarily of inventory and machinery  to a national converting company and simultaneously entered into a supplier agreement with the buyer 
the transaction allows the company to focus its efforts on marketing and selling the products and in developing an alliance with the largest converter in the industry 
the company recorded a loss on the divestiture of  the effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the lower rate in is primarily due to non deductible expenses being a lesser percent of income in compared to the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of for both years is primarily attributable to the effect of state income taxes and non deductible expenses

this sales increase is primarily the result of the vgc acquisition 
excluding the impact of the vgc acquisition  sales were flat during the year  with modest decreases in the first half of the year and modest increases in the second half 
gross profit as a percent of sales remained stable between the two years  at in and in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased from in to in as previously indicated  in  the company incurred a restructuring charge of  this expense was incurred in the consolidation of five distribution centers  the realignment of two others  and the centralization of certain financial and information services 
the efficiencies in aligning operations by geographical area and consolidating duplicate facilities and functions  combined with other cost reduction programs resulted in a containment of expenses in interest expense decreased from  in to  in prior to the acquisition of vgc in november  interest expense was lower during the year due to decreased working capital levels 
with the acquisition of vgc  the debt levels increased with a corresponding increase in interest expense 
the effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the lower rate in is primarily due to non deductible expenses being a lesser percent of income in compared to financial condition and liquidity cash used in operating activities was  in cash provided by operations was  and  in and  respectively 
the substantial decrease in cash flow in compared to is primarily due to increased working capital levels in this increase reflects the adjustment of working capital levels for the vgc acquisition to ongoing operating levels and temporary increases in inventory levels to ensure inventory availability through the conversion of the company to a single business system 
the effect of changes in asset levels decreased cash flow by million in  compared to an increase in cash flows in of 
million 
in addition  although the cash flow from operations excludes the pretax gain on the sale of the capital lease  the related tax expense of approximately million is reflected in the outflow of cash 
cash flow provided by investing activities was  in  compared to cash flows used by investing activities of  and  in and  respectively 
the cash generated in was primarily from the sale of the capital lease and the pressroom material converting operation 
the primary expenditure in  was for the vgc acquisition 
in the three years  property and equipment expenditures ranged between and million 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at december  capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million

cash flows from financing activities were  used in   provided in  and  used in the cash used in was primarily for the paydown of debt of  and was primarily provided from the proceeds from the sale of the capital lease and the business divestiture 
in  the cash provided was from an increase in debt and an increase in the book overdraft  and was used along with cash generated from operations for the vgc acquisition 
the other primary component of financing activities was dividend payments of million in and and million in the company s primary source of debt financing is a revolving credit agreement with a commitment of million of which million was available at december  the company believes this source of borrowing  combined with cash from operations  is sufficient to support the current capital requirements of the company 
for potential acquisitions which would exceed the current financing levels  the company believes based on the current capacity of the balance sheet for additional debt  with a current debt to equity ratio of 
to  and the company s prior success in integrating new acquisitions  additional debt capital would be available to the company at favorable rates 
procedures for the year issue the company s business system will require program modifications prior to the year  for what is commonly referred to as the year issue 
similar to other systems  the system currently abbreviates the year to a two digit number 
as currently programmed  this abbreviation will cause many of the functions within the system which are date sensitive to operate improperly or malfunction in the year the company has contracted with the software manufacture to work with the company s management information system department to make the necessary programming changes to correct this problem 
this work is scheduled for the summer of the company does not anticipate the cost of the modifications will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
