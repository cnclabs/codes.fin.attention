in the company is assessing the impact of the year issue as it relates to the company s information systems and vendor supplied application software 
management does not currently anticipate any significant or material impact on the company as a result of implications associated with that issue 
other the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season  when tenant occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve most of their temporary tenant rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the retail industry has experienced some difficulty  which is reflected in sales trends and in the bankruptcies and continued restructuring of several prominent retail organizations 
continuation of these trends could impact future earnings performance 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  inflation may have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time
