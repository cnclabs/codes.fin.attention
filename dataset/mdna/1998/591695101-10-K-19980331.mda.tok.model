subscriber growth and revenue increases during were the result of implementing a new strategy  by which buildings were wired in advance and targeted for a lower priced  broader based program package 
this strategy was implemented in riga  lativa and tashkent  uzbekistan which had increased revenues of approximately million and  respectively 
in  this strategy was expanded to all cable ventures  and this coupled with acquisitions of systems in romania and moldova contributed to the subscriber growth and revenues increases at the operations in tashkent  uzbekistan  kishinev  moldova and almaty  kazakstan  each of which had revenue increases of million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in operating results reflect the favorable relationship between certain fixed operating costs and the increase in subscribers  combined with costs savings achieved through economies of scale resulting in contract re negotiation with programmers and other suppliers

other increases in revenue in of approximately  and million were achieved at the paging operations in tallin  estonia and riga  latvia 
during  increases in revenue of approximately  and  achieved at paging operations in nizhny novgorod  russia and tashkent  uzbekistan  respectively  were primarily attributable for the overall growth

the revenue growth is due to increases in the number of advertising spots purchased and increases in the price of the advertising spots

petersburg  russia  respectively 
in addition  the acquisition during of a four station radio group in estonia contributed approximately  to the revenue increase 
in  revenue at the radio operations in hungary increased from by million 
the steady increase in operating income from to and is a result of the increases in revenue growth and is reflective of management s philosophy to continually develop existing audience share and revenue base offset by the effects of start up costs associated with new stations acquired in both and telephony revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively

the improvement in operating results from to and is the result of the telecom georgia international toll calling operating income offset by effect of start up gsm operations in latvia and georgia 
foreign currency the communications group s strategy is to minimize its foreign currency risk 
to the extent possible  in countries that have experienced high rates of inflation  the communications group bills and collects all revenues in us dollars or an equivalent local currency amount adjusted on a monthly basis for exchange rate fluctuations 
the communications group s joint ventures are generally permitted to maintain us dollar accounts to service their us dollar denominated credit lines  thereby reducing foreign currency risk 
as the communications group and its joint ventures expand their operations and become more dependent on local currency based transactions  the communications group expects that its foreign currency exposure will increase 
the communications group currently does not hedge against exchange rate risk and therefore could be subject in the future to declines in exchange rates between the time a joint venture receives its funds in local currencies and the time it distributes such funds in us dollars to the communications group

liquidity and capital resources the company mmg is a holding company and  accordingly  does not generate cash flows 
the communications group is dependent on mmg for significant capital infusions to fund its operations and make acquisitions  as well as to fulfill its commitments to make capital contributions and loans to its joint ventures 
such funding requirements are based on the anticipated funding needs of its joint ventures and certain acquisitions committed to by the company 
future capital requirements of the communications group  including future acquisitions  will depend on available funding from the company and on the ability of the communications group s joint ventures to generate positive cash flows 
snapper is restricted under covenants contained in its credit agreement from making dividend payments or advances to mmg and the company has periodically funded the short term working capital needs of snapper 
the company  at its discretion  can make dividend payments on its cumulative convertible preferred stock in either cash or common stock 
if the company were to elect to pay the dividend in cash  the annual cash requirement would be million 
since each of the communications group s joint ventures operates businesses  such as cable television  fixed telephony  paging and cellular telecommunications  that are capital intensive and require significant capital investment in order to construct and develop operational systems and market its services  the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company will require in addition to its cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale of landmark  additional financing in order to satisfy its on going working capital requirements and to achieve its long term business strategies 
such additional capital may be provided through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities of the company or by separate equity or debt financings by the communications group or certain companies of the communications group 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate additional funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly its long term business objectives and the company s results from operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that its cash on hand  together with the net proceeds from the sale of landmark  will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements for the remainder of management believes that its long term liquidity needs will be satisfied through a combination of the company s successful implementation and execution of its growth strategy to become a global communications and media company and the communications group s joint ventures achieving positive operating results and cash flows through revenue and subscriber growth and control of operating expenses 
as the communications group is in the early stages of development  the company expects to generate significant consolidated net losses for the foreseeable future as the communications group continues to build out its facilities and market its services 
communications group the communications group has invested significantly in cash or equipment through capital contributions  loans and management assistance and training in its joint ventures 
the communications group has also incurred significant expenses in identifying  negotiating and pursuing new wireless telecommunications opportunities in selected emerging markets 
the communications group and virtually all of its joint ventures are experiencing continuing losses and negative operating cash flow since the businesses are in the development and start up phase of operations 
eastern europe and the republics of the former soviet union the cable television  paging  fixed wireless loop telephony  gsm and international toll calling businesses in the aggregate are capital intensive 
the communications group generally provides the primary source of funding for its joint ventures both for working capital and capital expenditures  with the exception of its gsm joint ventures 
the gsm joint ventures have been funded to date on a pro rata basis by western sponsors  and the communications group has funded its pro rata share of the gsm joint venture obligations 
the communications group has and continues to have discussions with vendors  commercial lenders and international financial institutions to provide funding for the gsm joint ventures 
the communications group s joint venture agreements generally provide for the initial contribution of cash or assets by the joint venture partners  and for the provision of a line of credit from the communications group to the joint venture 
under a typical arrangement  the communications group s joint venture partner contributes the necessary licenses or permits under which the joint venture will conduct its business  studio or office space  transmitting tower rights and other equipment 
the communications group s contribution is generally cash and equipment  but may consist of other specific assets as required by the applicable joint venture agreement 
credit agreements between the joint ventures and the communications group are intended to provide such joint ventures with sufficient funds for operations and equipment purchases 
the credit agreements generally provide for interest to accrue at rates ranging from the prime rate to the prime rate plus and for payment of principal and interest from of the joint venture s available cash flow  as defined  prior item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to any distributions of dividends to the communications group or its joint venture partners 
the credit agreements also often provide the communications group the right to appoint the general director of the joint venture and the right to approve the annual business plan of the joint venture 
advances under the credit agreements are made to the joint ventures in the form of cash for working capital purposes  as direct payment of expenses or expenditures  or in the form of equipment  at the cost of the equipment plus cost of shipping 
as of december   the communications group was committed to provide funding under the various charter fund agreements and credit lines in an aggregate amount of approximately million  of which million remained unfunded 
the communications group s funding commitments under a credit agreement are contingent upon its approval of the joint venture s business plan 
the communications group reviews the actual results compared to the approved business plan on a periodic basis 
if the review indicates a material variance from the approved business plan  the communications group may terminate or revise its commitment to fund under the credit agreements 
the communications group s consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures ability to generate positive operating results is dependent upon their ability to attract subscribers to their systems  their ability to control operating expenses and the sale of commercial advertising time 
management s current plans with respect to the joint ventures are to increase subscriber and advertiser bases and thereby operating revenues by developing a broader band of programming packages for wireless cable and radio broadcasting and by offering additional services and options for paging and telephony services 
by offering the large local populations of the countries in which the joint ventures operate desired services at attractive prices  management believes that the joint ventures can increase their subscriber and advertiser bases and generate positive operating cash flow  reducing their dependence on the communications group for funding of working capital 
additionally  advances in wireless subscriber equipment technology are expected to reduce capital requirements per subscriber 
further initiatives to develop and establish profitable operations include reducing operating costs as a percentage of revenue and assisting joint ventures in developing management information systems and automated customer care and service systems 
no assurances can be given that such initiatives will be successful or if successful  will result in such reductions 
additionally  if the joint ventures do become profitable and generate sufficient cash flows in the future  there can be no assurance that the joint ventures will pay dividends or will return capital at any time
