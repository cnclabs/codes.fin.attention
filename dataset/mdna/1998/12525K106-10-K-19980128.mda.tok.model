item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cfm technologies  inc designs  manufactures and markets advanced wet processing equipment for sale to the worldwide semiconductor and flat panel display fpd manufacturing industries 
the company was founded in and began commercial operations in following a period of technology and product development  during which time the company s patented full flow enclosed processing and direct displace drying technologies were developed 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of its systems  recent sales of which have ranged in price from approximately million to million 
as of october   the company has shipped over systems to more than semiconductor and fpd manufacturers worldwide 
the company has been undergoing a period of rapid growth with net sales during fiscal increasing by over net sales for fiscal net sales of full flow systems to companies in the fpd manufacturing industry represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the company believes that capital expenditures in the fpd manufacturing industry are subject to significant variations and expects that its fpd sales as a percentage of total sales will fluctuate as the company attempts to penetrate new accounts 
sales of fpd full flow systems to lg represented of all fpd sales during fiscal the company believes that fpd full flow system sales will represent a smaller portion of total sales during fiscal the company sells its systems worldwide and records a significant portion of its sales to customers outside the united states 
in fiscal  international sales constituted of net sales  including sales to customers in korea and taiwan which represented and of total sales  respectively 
in the fall of  the currencies and economies of certain asian countries  including korea  came under pressure 
some of these asian countries subsequently experienced currency devaluation  received external financial support and agreed to certain economic reorganization programs anticipated to reduce growth and credit demand 
in december  the company received notification of an order cancellation as a result of these events 
adjusted for that cancellation  orders scheduled for shipment to korea and taiwan in the company s backlog as of october  represented and of the total backlog  respectively 
the company was informed by a customer in taiwan that the customer could not take delivery of an order scheduled to be shipped in october because of a fire in the customer s factory 
this action caused a reduction of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal from the level previously anticipated by the company 
there can be no assurance that the recent economic events in korea  taiwan and other asian countries will not continue to affect the company s net sales 
cancellation of additional orders could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has significantly increased its operations to support increased revenues  including the hiring of additional personnel  and has made and expects to continue to make substantial investments in research  engineering and development to support product development as well as sales and marketing to promote its products 
in addition  the company entered into several leases to allow it to expand its manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve a rate of growth or level of sales in any future period commensurate with its recent growth and its level of expenses 
future results will depend upon a variety of factors  including the timing of significant orders  the ability of the company to bring new systems to market  the timing of new product releases by the company s competitors  patterns of capital spending by the company s customers  the impact of economic controls in countries where the company does business  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s systems  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors and the volatility of the semiconductor and fpd industries and of the markets served by the company s customers 
the company s gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of systems and the mix of sales to domestic and international markets 
the company pays significant commissions to agents on sales in east asia 
as a result  gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales have in the past and will continue in the future to fluctuate based to a large extent on changes in proportion of net sales in east asia 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of the company s statements of income for the fiscal years ended october   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  these increases resulted primarily from increased demand for the company s full flow systems by companies in the semiconductor and fpd industries as the company s customers equipped new facilities or expanded facilities  resulting in multiple systems purchases by some of the company s major customers  and initial sales to new customers 
net sales for fiscal and fiscal included sales of full flow systems to companies in the fpd manufacturing industry representing approximately and of net sales  respectively 
the company believes that capital expenditures in the fpd manufacturing industry are subject to significant variations and expects that its fpd sales as a percentage of total sales will fluctuate as the company attempts to penetrate new accounts 
sales of fpd full flow systems to lg semiconductor  a manufacturer located in korea  represented of all fpd sales during fiscal the company believes that fpd full flow system sales will represent a smaller portion of net sales during fiscal international sales represented  and of total net sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the number of international customers receiving shipments of the company s systems increased in both fiscal and the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of its net sales as a result of continuing expansion of its international sales  service and support organization 
for a description of recent economic events in korea  taiwan and other asian countries and their effects on the company  see overview 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to increases in manufacturing and procurement efficiencies because of increased volume 
gross margin in fiscal remained substantially constant at 
the level of gross profit in fiscal and fiscal can be attributed to a mix of increases in sales prices  changes in product mix  reductions in the cost of component parts due to volume and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from increased volume and the expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses increased from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal and further increased to million or of net sales in fiscal the substantial increase in research  development and engineering spending in fiscal is attributable to the company s completion in march of development of a full flow system configured to process wafers per vessel and the release of this system s design to the company s manufacturing division 
in addition  during fiscal the company incurred substantial research  development and engineering expenses in support of the development of its first full flow system for use in manufacturing flat panel displays 
the further significant increase in research  development and engineering spending which occurred in fiscal is attributable to the development of a much larger full flow fpd system which was first delivered in june additionally  the full flow  capable of processing wafers in a single vessel  was introduced in october the company is developing a version of the full flow platform to process mm semiconductor wafers and anticipates that production systems will be available for shipment in the first half of fiscal the company believes that a substantial investment in research  development and engineering is critical to maintaining a strong technological position and accordingly expects such expenses in fiscal will increase over the level 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal and to million or of net sales in fiscal the increases in fiscal and resulted primarily from increases in sales and marketing costs related to increased customer support and increased international sales  and legal expenses related to litigation undertaken to protect one of the company s patents 
the company believes that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal and beyond  as increased personnel and sales and support expenses are anticipated in connection with the company s efforts to increase its net sales and as the company continues to invest in developing and protecting its patents and other intellectual property rights 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  of million in fiscal and represented and of net sales  respectively 
in fiscal  interest income  net of interest expense  was million or of net sales 
the company incurred interest expenses due to intra period borrowings on its revolving line of credit during fiscal and which borrowings were utilized to support the company s increased working capital requirements 
in fiscal  net interest income was earned as a result of the investment of funds not immediately required for the company s operations which were available as a result of the company s initial public offering in june and a follow on offering in february income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal the rate for fiscal reflects a reduction in the research and development tax credit because of lower research  development and engineering expenses 
the rate for fiscal reflects the unavailability of the research and development tax credit during the majority of the year 
in contrast  the rate for fiscal reflects tax benefits from the research and development tax credit along with significant tax benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation as a result of the company s export sales 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has funded its capital requirements through funding from two research and development limited partnerships  the sale of private equity securities  the company s initial public offering of common stock completed in june  a follow on offering of common stock completed in february and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings and equipment leases 
as of october   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories were million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively  in fiscal during fiscal  accounts receivable increased due to higher revenues and customer payment delays due to added review on initial sales of production systems by customer production personnel prior to receivable payment 
this review is sometimes time consuming and precedes receipt of the final payment amount negotiated as a part of the original purchase agreement 
subsequent deliveries of similar products usually result in significantly more rapid collection of final amounts owed 
a similar situation can occur with initial installations at new customer sites as personnel unfamiliar with full flow systems receive training 
accounts receivable balances are expected to continue to fluctuate with the volume of shipments of certain products and of products to new customer sites 
purchases of property  plant and equipment were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily related to fit up of the company s new leased office facility and acquisition of an advanced three dimensional computer aided design system for use in the company s research  development and engineering activities in fiscal and for improvements in information systems infrastructure  expansion of the company s applications laboratory  additional customer and employee training facilities and expanded production capacity in fiscal during fiscal  the company leased an additional  square feet of space in a facility in the same industrial park as its owned manufacturing and leased administrative facilities to house a portion of the company s production operations and its customer satisfaction function 
the company also entered into a lease with a minimum term of years for two facilities  a  square foot production facility and a  square foot office facility  to be built in exton  pennsylvania  approximately miles from the site of the company s current operations 
the company intends to retain its owned facility in west chester  pennsylvania for use in manufacturing  customer and employee training and research and development while moving all other functions to exton late in the fall of the company has a relationship with a commercial bank which includes a mortgage on the company s manufacturing facility in the amount of million and a million revolving demand line of credit 
the mortgage bears interest at an annual rate of 
the line of credit is unsecured and borrowings are at an interest rate equal to such bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings at october  the company also has mortgage notes payable to the pennsylvania industrial development authority in the amount of million bearing interest at and to the chester county development council in the amount of million bearing interest at 
in addition  the company has outstanding capital lease obligations in the amount of million bearing interest at rates ranging from to per annum 
the company had outstanding accounts receivable of approximately million and million as of october  and  respectively 
no allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has been recorded as the company believes that all such accounts receivable are fully realizable 
the company believes that existing cash balances and its available line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through the next months 
however  depending upon its rate of growth and profitability  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to meet its working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  will be available when required  or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the discussions above regarding the company s expectations of future sales  gross profits  research  development and engineering expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  product introductions and cash requirements include certain forward looking statements on these subjects 
as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include variations in the level of orders  which can be affected by general economic conditions and growth rates in specific geographic areas where the company may have a concentration of business  in the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries and in the markets served by the company s customers  the international economic and political climates  difficulties or delays in product functionality or performance  the delivery performance of sole source vendors  the timing of future product releases  failure to respond adequately to either changes in technology or customer preferences  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  ability to manage growth  risks of non payment of accounts receivable  changes in budgeted costs or failure to realize a successful outcome to pending patent litigation  all of which constitute significant risks 
there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely affected by one of more of these factors
