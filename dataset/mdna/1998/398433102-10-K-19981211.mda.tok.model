item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales by business segment were as follows percentage increase millions building products specialty plastic films electronic information and communication systems net sales of the building products segment increased by million compared to companies acquired during that are included in operating results for a full year accounted for approximately million of the sales increase 
higher unit sales of garage doors resulting from continued strong demand in the residential and related retail markets contributed approximately million of the increase 
sales increases in the segment s installation services business stemming from geographic expansion and internal growth  partly offset by the effect of competitive pricing on the segment accounted for the balance of the increase 
net sales of the specialty plastic films segment increased by million compared to in july the specialty plastic films segment acquired a plastic packaging manufacturer located in germany which accounted for a sales increase of million 
lower than anticipated sales from new programs in the infant diaper market contributed to a modest increase in unit volume  the effects of which were offset by price competition in the commodity end of the segment s business  and a pass through to customers of lower resin prices 
net sales of the electronic information and communication systems segment increased by million  principally because of new program awards and increased funding levels on several programs in the segment s defense and international business 
included were sales of approximately million  a million increase compared to the prior year  under a contract to provide integrated radio management and communication systems for a united kingdom coastal surveillance aircraft program that is projected to extend through operating income by business segment was as follows percentage increase decrease millions building products specialty plastic films electronic information and communication systems operating income of the building products segment decreased by million compared to the effect of the sales growth was offset by competitive pricing pressures  capacity constraints and related manufacturing inefficiencies due to delay in implementing an additional production line  increased operating expenses associated with new distribution centers and certain manufacturing inefficiencies related to production of commercial doors 
orders in the garage door business remain strong 
however  capacity constraints and continued competitive pricing impacted this segment s operating earnings 
additional capacity is being implemented and is expected to be in place early in fiscal operating income of the specialty plastic films segment declined by million compared to last year 
the segment experienced decreased earnings in the first nine months of fiscal due to lower than anticipated sales from new programs and price competition in the commodity end of the segment s business 
these decreases were partly offset by improving operating results in the last quarter of the year due to increased unit sales volume from new infant diaper programs and earnings from an acquired company 
although specialty plastic films continues to be affected by pricing pressures  it is anticipated that continued volume growth  principally in the segment s european operations  plus earnings from the acquired company for a full year will result in improved operating results in this segment 
operating income of the electronic information and communication systems segment increased by million due to the increased sales 
net interest expense increased by million compared to due to higher levels of outstanding debt in from acquisitions in and  from borrowings to finance new production lines for specialty plastic films joint venture and from lower investable balances in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales by business segment were as follows percentage increase millions building products specialty plastic films electronic information and communication systems net sales of the building products segment increased by million compared to acquired companies accounted for million of the sales increase 
higher unit sales of garage doors resulting from continued strong demand in the residential and related retail markets  along with sales increases in the installation services business stemming from geographic expansion and internal growth  aggregated million of the increase 
net sales of the specialty plastic films segment increased by million over  principally because of increased unit sales from growth in new programs for its major customer for the infant diaper market 
net sales of the electronic information and communication systems segment increased by million compared to  principally because of new program awards and increased funding levels on several programs in the segment s defense and international business 
operating income by business segment was as follows percentage increase decrease millions building products specialty plastic films electronic information and communication systems operating income of the building products segment increased by million over higher garage door unit sales  growth in the installation services business  earnings of acquired companies  operating efficiencies and lower raw material costs all contributed to the increase 
operating income of the specialty plastic films segment declined by 
million compared to new product development and start up costs  increased raw material costs and price competition in the commodity end of the segment s business were the principal reasons for the decrease 
operating income of the electronic information and communication systems segment increased by 
million due to the increased sales 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for was million  and working capital was million at september  during  the specialty plastic films segment acquired a plastic packaging manufacturer located in dombuhl  germany with annual sales of approximately million whose purchase price of approximately million was substantially financed by borrowings under a subsidiary s bank credit agreement 
during the year  million was used to acquire approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
since  approximately million shares of capital stock have been purchased for million under the company s stock repurchase program 
the company rents various real property and equipment through noncancellable operating leases 
related future minimum lease payments due in approximate million and are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
in the company had fixed asset additions of million  including construction and equipment costs of approximately million for new production lines for its specialty plastic films joint venture in germany  and approximately million to upgrade and enhance strategic business systems 
the balance of capital expenditures were principally made in connection with increasing production capacity and to improve manufacturing efficiency in the building products segment 
during the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately to million  primarily in the building products and specialty plastic films segments in connection with additional production capacity and manufacturing improvements  and the continuing systems upgrade program 
there are no other significant commitments for future capital expenditures or investments  although it is likely that cash outflows for business acquisitions  capital expenditures and leases will continue 
anticipated cash flows from operations  together with existing cash  bank lines of credit and lease line availability  should be adequate to finance presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to repay long term debt as it matures 
year the company had previously initiated programs to upgrade and enhance strategic business systems in order to replace aging technologies and provide the infrastructure to support growth in each of its business segments 
in addition to other benefits that are anticipated from these upgrades and enhancements  the new systems are designed to be year compliant  and play an important role in the company s overall year strategy 
the strategy is designed to address the company s application software  hardware and related operating platforms it systems  embedded technology such as microcontrollers in production equipment or products  and third parties  principally suppliers and customers 
due to the diverse nature of the company s operations and other factors such as the number of facilities and degree of information systems centralization  these efforts are at varying stages of completion 
in each of the company s business segments  identification of critical it systems was generally performed as a part of the segment s upgrade and enhancement program for strategic business systems 
assessment of identified  critical it systems for year compliance for each business segment was also completed as a part of the segment s upgrade and enhancement program 
inventories and assessments of remaining systems are expected to be completed by the beginning of within the electronic information and communication systems segment  most of the critical it systems have been replaced with systems that are year compliant 
remediation efforts for the remaining critical it systems are underway and the replacement process is expected to be completed by june remediation of non critical it systems is anticipated to be completed by the beginning of the specialty plastic films segment has replaced all critical it systems with new systems that are year compliant 
replacement of non critical it systems is anticipated to be completed by march the building products segment initially estimated that year issues would be addressed within the context of its existing upgrade and enhancement program 
this program however  is running behind schedule  and alternative plans have been developed and are being implemented in order to remediate identified year issues 
these plans call for the application of software modifications to existing systems  though efforts to implement previously planned upgrades and enhancements are expected to continue 
the inability of the company to timely implement the modifications due to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in developing  testing and implementing software  would adversely affect the segment s profitability due to increased operating costs and related inefficiencies 
with respect to embedded technology  inventories and assessments in each of the company s business segments are in process and are expected to be completed in the beginning of until the inventories and assessments are complete  it is not possible to determine what action  if any  will be required to be taken  or the likely result of inability to timely implement any required corrective action 
in evaluating the impact of year on significant third parties  each business segment will identify any such relationships and contact the parties involved or otherwise attain an understanding of such third parties year readiness 
this process is underway and it is expected that significant third parties will be identified and contacted by the beginning of until this process is completed  it is not possible to predict the likely outcome of any significant third parties failure to attain year compliance 
the company estimates that aggregate capital expenditures for systems upgrade and enhancement programs will be approximately million 
through september  the company had incurred approximately million of such costs with the balance to be incurred through fiscal in addition  the company estimates that approximately to million will be expended for year consulting costs 
the company has not separately tracked all costs for year efforts since such compliance was expected to be achieved as an ancillary benefit of budgeted systems upgrade and enhancement programs  or principally consist of payroll and related costs for information systems personnel
