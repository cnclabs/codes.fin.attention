competition 
the microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid changes in both technology and the strategic direction of major microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers

the company has limited resources and must restrict its product development efforts to a relatively small number of projects 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rapid technological change and development risks 
operating system vendors such as microsoft have added features to new versions of their products that provide some of the same functionality traditionally offered in symantec s products 
symantec believes this trend may continue 
microsoft may incorporate advanced features in future versions of operating systems that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
in addition  a number of software developers have integrated antivirus capabilities into their internet products 
while symantec plans to continue to improve its products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over that provided in current and future operating systems  these efforts may not be successful and such improved products may not be commercially accepted by software users 
symantec will also attempt to work with operating system vendors in an effort to make its products compatible with those operating systems  yet differentiate those utility products from features included in the operating systems 
however  these efforts may not be successful 
other competitors may license their products to other hardware and software original equipment manufacturers oem s 
in addition  as software users move toward running programs from the internet or over a lan  the need for certain of symantec s utility programs may decrease

in addition  these and other company products compete less directly with a number of other products that offer levels of functionality different from those offered by symantec s products or that were designed for a somewhat different group of end users than those targeted by symantec 
microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities including telecommunications  facsimile and data recovery utilities in windows and may include additional product features in windows or future releases of windows nt that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
also  symantec s competitors may license certain of their products to microsoft and oem s for inclusion in their operating systems  which may reduce the demand for certain of the company s products 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating system  microsoft windows symantec also competes with microcomputer hardware manufacturers that develop their own software products 
further  symantec competes with other microcomputer software companies for access to the channels of retail distribution and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
finally  symantec competes with other software companies in its efforts to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
symantec believes that competition in the industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand their product lines into additional product categories

manufacturing and backlog 
symantec s product development organization produces a set of master cd rom s or diskettes and documentation for each product that are then duplicated and packaged into products by the manufacturing organization 
most of symantec s domestic manufacturing is performed by outside contractors under the supervision of symantec s manufacturing organization 
purchasing of most raw materials and fulfillment of most orders is done by symantec personnel in symantec s sunnyvale  california facility 
the manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside organizations include the duplication of diskettes and cd rom s  printing of documentation materials and assembly of the final package 
symantec performs diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in its dublin  ireland manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the united states and canada 
most of symantec s international cd rom manufacturing is performed by outside contractors in dublin  ireland 
symantec has often been able to acquire materials on a volume discount basis and has had multiple sources of supply for certain materials 
to date  symantec has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging 
however  shortages may occur in the future 
symantec normally ships products within one week after receiving an order 
thus  symantec does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
price competition 
price competition is sometimes intense with certain products in the microcomputer business software market and is expected to continue to increase and become even more significant in the future  and may result in reduced profit margins 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations price competition 
seasonality 
while symantec s diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues  these fluctuations have occurred and may occur in the future 
these fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of symantec s products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign software markets and the market s transition between operating systems 
these factors may cause significant fluctuations in net revenues and  accordingly  operating results 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fluctuations in quarterly operating results and stock price 
product protection 
symantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and license agreements in an attempt to protect its rights 
however  symantec is still subject to potential legal suits 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations intellectual property rights  litigation 
employees 
as of march   symantec employed approximately  people  including  in sales  marketing and related staff activities  in product development and in management  manufacturing  administration and finance 
none of the employees is represented by a labor union  and symantec has experienced no work stoppages 
symantec believes that its employee relations are good 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and shares to be issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan  and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such incentive programs

the increase in net revenues was the result of symantec s penetration of new and emerging markets in latin america and asia pacific  as well as increased sales in europe 
net revenues from international sales declined by million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was due largely to the recognition in fiscal of approximately million of previously deferred revenue related to an acquired company 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal and did not materially affect annual revenue 
the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on international revenues is partially mitigated by operating expenses incurred in local currencies 
product returns 
the company estimates and maintains reserves for product returns 
the level of actual product returns and related product return provisions are largely a factor of the level of product sell in gross revenue from normal sales activity and the replacement of obsolete quantities with the current version of the company s products 
changes in the levels of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by changing levels of gross revenue and  therefore  the product return provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented 
gross margin 
gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write off of capitalized software 
gross margins increased to of net revenues in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal factors contributing to an increase in gross margin percentage during fiscal include reduction of direct material costs by shifting product media from more expensive diskettes to lower priced cd rom s and reductions in the size of bound manuals through a shift in documentation from paper manuals to electronic manuals included on cd rom s for all of the company s principal products 
additional reductions occurred in manufacturing overhead costs due to improved economies of scale and reductions in capitalized software amortization and write offs as discussed below 
in addition  fiscal royalty revenues from jetform and hewlett packard totaling million had minimal costs of revenue 
the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in capitalized software amortization and write offs as discussed below 
in addition  fiscal royalty revenues from jetform and hewlett packard totaling million had minimal costs of revenue 
capitalized software 
during fiscal  accounting standards requiring capitalization of certain software development costs did not materially affect the company 
during fiscal  symantec capitalized approximately million of software development costs  primarily related to network administration technology 
prior to fiscal  accounting standards requiring capitalization of certain software development costs did not materially affect the company  except for amounts capitalized by delrina prior to its acquisition by symantec in fiscal amortization of capitalized software  including amortization and write off of both purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal is attributed to the write off of approximately million of unamortized capitalized software and unamortized purchased software product rights related to network administration technology written off as part of the sale of the networking business unit to hewlett packard in march amortization and write off expense in fiscal year was lower than in due to capitalized software write offs in fiscal related to de emphasized products and delrina windows products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses represented  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as the result of increased spending on new product development 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal largely resulted from the company s decision to cease development of certain software products no longer actively marketed by symantec 
another contributing factor was the elimination of certain network administration technology development due to the sale of symantec s networking business unit to hewlett packard during fiscal research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to decreased product development efforts resulting from the company s decision to cease developing certain software products and an increase in the capitalization of software development costs  including approximately million related to network administration technology 
in addition  a million research and development expense reimbursement was received from hewlett packard in fiscal under the previously mentioned technology sale agreement  which further reduced research and development expenses in fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net revenues in fiscal from million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to increased international sales and marketing activities 
north american sales and marketing activities during fiscal decreased as a percentage of net revenues as compared to fiscal due to the elimination of activities related to the electronic forms and network administration software technologies and products which were sold in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal from million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the elimination of duplicative sales and marketing expenses as a result of the acquisition of delrina by symantec and the elimination of sales and marketing expenses related to the electronic forms software products which were sold in fiscal reductions in expenditures for products no longer actively marketed by symantec were offset by increased spending for new products released during the fiscal general and administrative expenses 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses were of net revenues during fiscal  and general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal at a rate proportionate to net revenue growth as the result of increased personnel expenses associated with the growth of the company 
the fiscal increase in general and administrative expenses  as compared to fiscal  is primarily the result of management consulting expenditures  offset by benefits from the elimination of duplicative general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of delrina by symantec in fiscal acquisition  restructuring and other expenses 
no acquisition  restructuring and other expenses were incurred in fiscal acquisition expenses 
in connection with the acquisitions completed in fiscal and see summary of significant accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k  symantec incurred significant acquisition related expenses 
symantec recorded total acquisition charges of approximately million in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of fast track 
in connection with the acquisition of delrina in fiscal  symantec recorded total acquisition charges of million 
these acquisition expenses primarily related to legal  accounting and financial advisory services  elimination of duplicative and excess facilities and equipment  personnel severance and outplacement services  and operational activities consolidation and discontinuance 
offsetting these costs was a reduction in accrued acquisition  restructuring and other expenses of approximately million  as actual costs incurred related to certain prior acquisitions were less than costs previously accrued by the company 
restructuring expenses 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for costs related to the restructuring of certain domestic and international sales and research and development operations  certain legal settlements and other expenses 
in fiscal  the company incurred approximately million for equipment and personnel relocation costs related to the consolidation of certain research and development activities 
the restructuring plans have been completed 
other expenses 
in fiscal  symantec recorded an approximately million charge in connection with the write off of an equity investment and an approximately million charge for the write off of certain in process research and development acquired by the company 
in fiscal  symantec incurred a million loss on the sale of the assets of time line solutions corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary 
additionally  in fiscal  the company recorded million for estimated legal fees and other expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
remaining acquisition  restructuring and other expense accruals as of march  were approximately million 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal due to higher average invested cash balances 
higher average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal were offset by lower interest rates on invested cash during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense was approximately million in fiscal  and interest expense is principally related to symantec s convertible subordinated debentures 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
other income expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
the effective income tax provision rate for fiscal was  which compares to an effective income tax provision rate of in fiscal and an effective tax benefit rate of in fiscal the income tax provision rate of is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unbenefitted losses and tax credits and a lower statutory tax rate for the company s irish operations 
in addition  fewer unbenefitted losses were available in fiscal  which caused the fiscal tax rate to be higher than the fiscal tax rate 
realization of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted us earnings 
the net deferred tax asset includes a valuation allowance of approximately million 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized 
the remaining million of the valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return limitations and under the change of ownership rules of internal revenue code section symantec projects the effective tax rate to be in fiscal this rate is lower than the expected us federal and state combined statutory rate of due primarily to a lower tax rate from the company s irish operation 
however  this projection is subject to change due to fluctuations in and the geographic allocation of earnings 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fluctuations in quarterly operating results  foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash  short term investments and long term investments increased million to million at fiscal year end from million at fiscal year end 
this increase was largely due to cash provided from operating activities  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and net proceeds from the sales of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to cash  short term investments and long term investments of million  the company has million of restricted investments related to collateral requirements under lease agreements entered into by symantec during fiscal symantec is obligated under certain lease agreements for two existing office buildings  one parcel of land and one office building under construction in cupertino  california to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet operating cash requirements 
see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and was comprised of the company s net income of million  non cash related expenses of million and a net decrease in assets and liabilities of million 
net trade accounts receivable increased million to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal  primarily due to increased operating activities during fiscal with the growth of international sales to of net revenues in fiscal from of net revenues in fiscal  symantec is carrying an increased accounts receivable balance with longer average standard payment terms  as such longer payment terms are standard business practice in certain international markets 
at march   international days sale outstanding was days  as compared to days for north america 
during fiscal  the board of directors of symantec authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of symantec common stock 
at the end of fiscal  a total of  shares were repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
the authorized repurchase period has expired for the remaining  shares 
the repurchased shares have been reissued under the company s employee stock purchase and option programs 
the company recently renewed its million line of credit to expire in may the company was in compliance with the debt covenants for this line of credit as of april  at the end of fiscal  there were no borrowings outstanding and less than million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this line 
future acquisitions by the company may cause the company to be in violation of the line of credit covenants 
however  the company believes that if the line of credit were canceled or amounts were not available under the line  there would not be a material adverse impact on the financial results  liquidity or capital resources of the company 
if symantec were to sustain significant losses  the company could be required to reduce operating expenses  which could result in product delays  reassess acquisition opportunities  which could negatively impact the company s growth objectives  and or pursue further financing options 
the company believes existing cash and short term investments and cash generated from operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year 
business risks the preceding discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
there are several important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion 
readers should pay particular attention to the risk factors set forth within this section 
nothing in this report shall impose upon symantec or any person a duty to update any forward looking statement 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results and stock price 
due to the factors noted below  the company s earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
symantec has previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which has had an immediate and significant adverse affect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
rapid technological change and development risks 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty related to new and emerging technologies and markets 
the recent trend toward server based applications in networks and applications distributed over the internet could have a material adverse affect on sales of the company s products 
future technology or market changes may cause certain of symantec s products to become obsolete more quickly than expected 
the use of a web browser running on either a pc or network computer to access client server systems is emerging as an alternative to the traditional desktop access through operating systems resident on personal computers 
should the functionality associated with such system access reduce the need for symantec s products  the company s future net revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
personal computer and hardware growth rates 
fluctuations in customer spending from software to hardware as the result of technological advancements in hardware or price reductions of hardware have in the past  and may in the future  result in reduced revenues which would have a material adverse affect on operating results 
operating system 
the release and subsequent customer acceptance of current or enhanced operating systems are particularly important events that increase the uncertainty and increase the volatility of symantec s results 
should the company be unable successfully or timely to develop products that operate under existing or new operating systems  or should the functionality of such operating systems reduce the need for symantec s products  the company s future net revenues and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities including telecommunications  facsimile and data recovery utilities in windows and may include additional product features in windows or future releases of windows nt that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
also  symantec s competitors may license certain of their products to microsoft and oem s for inclusion in their operating systems  which may reduce the demand for certain of the company s products 
microsoft windows with the anticipated introduction of microsoft s windows operating system  the company s ability to generate revenue from many of its current products will depend on its ability to develop new versions and enhancements of those products in a timely manner for the windows operating system 
because the department of justice and various state entities have filed lawsuits against microsoft which may delay the introduction of windows or change the interfaces or feature set that will be incorporated into windows  the company s ability to develop appropriate products for windows may be impeded  and consumers may delay purchases of the company s products or otherwise change purchase plans in a manner that could adversely affect the company and its financial results 
adverse effects related to these events could become apparent as early as the june quarter of dependence on the internet 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of the company s products  as well as to distribute software 
should the company be unable to incorporate changes in the internet environment successfully or timely into its business operations and product development strategy  the company s future net revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
price competition 
price competition is sometimes intense for certain products in the microcomputer software market and is expected to continue to increase and become even more significant in the future  resulting in reduced profit margins 
should competitive pressures in the industry continue to increase  symantec may be required to reduce software prices and or increase its spending on sales  marketing and research and development as a percentage of net revenues  resulting in lower profit margins 
these actions may not be sufficient to offset the impact of price competition in the company s business and net revenues 
integrated suites 
in the future  symantec and or its competitors may move toward providing integrated suites of products 
the price of integrated suites could be less than the sum of the prices of individual products included in these suites when such products are sold separately 
the sales volume contribution to symantec from integrated suites may not be sufficient to offset the gross margin impact of selling individual products at a reduced price using integrated product suites 
additionally  integrated suites may not achieve market acceptance and the company s products may not be effective in competing with integrated suites either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
quarterly buying patterns  absence of backlog 
most customers tend to make the majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter  in part because they are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms 
this is particularly true of large corporate customers that negotiate large site licenses near the end of each quarter 
this end of period buying pattern means that forecasts of quarterly and annual financial results are particularly vulnerable to the risk that they will not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on less favorable terms to the company 
the company operates with relatively little backlog  therefore  if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter  there could be an immediate  material adverse affect on net revenues and on the company s operating results  which would likely result in a precipitous drop in stock price 
retail distribution channel 
the company s retail distribution customers also carry the products of symantec s competitors 
these retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory  and their decisions to purchase the company s products is partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by symantec  as well as by its competitors over which the company has no control and which it cannot predict 
agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
certain distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distributors that account for significant sales of the company may experience financial difficulties in the future  which could lead to reduced sales or write offs and could adversely affect operating results of the company 
new distribution channels 
symantec may not be able to develop an effective method of distributing its software products utilizing each of the rapidly evolving software distribution channels  including the internet 
the presence of new channels could adversely impact existing channels and or product pricing  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s new revenues and profitability 
site licenses 
symantec sells volume license programs corporate site licenses through the distribution channel and through corporate resellers 
average site license revenue per unit is lower than the average revenue per unit from retail versions shipped through the retail distribution channel 
symantec may increase unit sales under volume licensing programs in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
additionally  symantec s products may not be effective in competing with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future  and the company s failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
channel fill 
the company s pattern of net revenues and earnings may be affected by channel fill 
distributors may fill their distribution channels in anticipation of price increases  sales promotions or incentives 
inventories may be decreased between the date symantec announces a new version or new product and the date of release  because distributors  dealers and end users often delay purchases  cancel orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version or new product 
the impact of channel fill is somewhat mitigated by the company s deferral of revenue associated with inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate levels in the distribution channel  however  net revenues may still be materially affected favorably or adversely by the effects of channel fill  particularly in periods where a large number of new products are simultaneously introduced 
channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell their inventories to retail distribution or end users as anticipated 
if sell through does not occur at a sufficient rate  distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories 
while such order delays or cancellations can cause fluctuations in net revenues from one quarter to the next  the impact is substantially mitigated by the company s deferral of revenue associated with inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate levels in the distribution channel 
product returns 
product returns can occur when the company introduces upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors have excess inventories 
symantec s return policy allows its distributors  subject to certain limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund  and retailers may return older versions of products 
the company estimates and maintains reserves for product returns 
however  future returns could exceed the reserves established by the company  which could have a material adverse affect on the operating results of the company 
foreign operations 
a significant portion of symantec s revenues  manufacturing costs and operating expenses is transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company s results may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  as well as increases in duty rates  exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies 
the company expects that its non us dollar denominated sales activities may increase in the future 
symantec utilizes natural hedging to mitigate symantec s transaction exposures and hedges certain residual balance sheet positions through the use of one month forward contracts 
these strategies may not continue to be effective  and the company may not be successful in minimizing or accurately forecasting transaction gains or losses 
the company s international operations are subject to certain risks common to international operations  such as government regulations  import restrictions  currency fluctuations  repatriation restrictions and  in certain jurisdictions  reduced protection for the company s copyrights and trademarks and economic volatility 
sales and marketing 
symantec believes substantial sales and marketing efforts are essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance symantec s competitive position 
there can be no assurance that these sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
technical support 
consistent with many companies in the software industry  technical support costs comprise a significant portion of the company s operating costs and expenses 
the company s technical support levels are based  in a large part  on projections of future sales levels 
over the short term  the company may not be able to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services or modify the format of the company s support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
while the company performs extensive quality control review over its technical support services provided by corporate personnel and  to a lesser extent  over support services outsourced to third party vendors  customer satisfaction with the services rendered may not be favorable 
in the event of customer dissatisfaction  future product and upgrade sales to that customer base may be negatively impacted 
fee based technical support services did not generate material revenues in any fiscal year presented and are not expected to generate material revenues in the near future 
uncertainty of research and development efforts 
symantec believes significant research and development expenditures will be necessary in order to remain competitive 
while the company performs extensive usability and beta testing of new products  any products currently being developed by symantec may not be technologically successful  resulting products may not achieve market acceptance  and the company s products may not be effective in competing with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
length of product development cycle 
the length of symantec s product development cycle has generally been greater than symantec originally expected 
although such delays have undoubtedly had a material adverse affect on symantec s business  symantec is not able to quantify the magnitude of net revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any particular delay because symantec is not able to predict the amount of net revenues that would have been obtained had the original development expectations been met 
delays in future product development are likely to occur and could have a material adverse affect on the amount and timing of future revenues 
due to the inherent uncertainties of software development projects  symantec does not generally disclose or announce the specific expected shipment dates of the company s product introductions 
operating leverage 
consistent with many companies in the software industry  employee and facility related expenditures comprise a significant portion of the company s operating costs and expenses 
the company s expense levels are based  in a large part  on projections of future revenue levels 
given the fixed nature of these expenses over the short term  if revenue levels fall below expectations  symantec s operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
management of expanding operations 
symantec continually evaluates its product and corporate strategy and has in the past and will in the future undertake organizational changes  product and marketing strategy modifications which are designed to maximize market penetration  maximize use of limited corporate resources and develop new products and product channels 
these organizational changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation of valuable limited resources to implement changes 
further  due to the uncertain nature of any of these undertakings  these efforts may not be successful  and that the company may not realize any benefit from these efforts 
reliance on joint business arrangements 
symantec has entered  and may in the future enter  into various development or joint business arrangements for the purpose of developing new software products or enhancements to existing software products 
depending on the nature of each such arrangement  the development  distribution  sale or marketing of the resulting product may be controlled either by symantec or its business partner 
resulting products from joint business arrangements may not be technologically successful  may not achieve market acceptance and may not be effective in competing with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
symantec distributes certain of its products through value added reseller var and independent software vendor isv customers whereby symantec s products are included with hardware products prior to sale through retail channels 
var and isv licensing agreements are generally non exclusive and do not require the var or isv to make minimum purchases 
if the company is not successful in maintaining its current relationships and securing license agreements with additional vars and isvs  or if the company s var and isv customers are not successful in selling their products  the company s future net revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
acquired companies 
symantec has completed a number of acquisitions and may acquire other companies in the future 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies in an efficient and timely manner  the retention of key employees  the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts and the integration of the acquired products 
in addition  because the employees of acquired companies have frequently remained in their existing  geographically diverse facilities  the company has not realized certain economies of scale that might otherwise have been achieved 
symantec typically incurs significant expenses in connection with acquisitions  which have a significant adverse impact on the company s profitability and financial resources 
future acquisitions may have a significant adverse impact on the company s future profitability and financial resources 
employee risk 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options which requires ongoing stockholder approval 
business disruption 
a disruption in communications between the company s geographically dispersed order entry and product shipping centers  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  would likely result in an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and could result in an adverse impact on operating results 
disruptions in communications and internet connectivity may also cause delays in customer access to symantec s internet based services or product sales 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers  and may cause delays in product development that could adversely impact future net revenues of the company 
litigation 
symantec is involved in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
the company intends to defend and or pursue all of these lawsuits vigorously and  although an unfavorable outcome could occur in one or more of the cases  the final resolution of these lawsuits  individually or in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the financial position of the company 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits  it is possible that the company s future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
intellectual property rights 
symantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and license agreements in an attempt to protect its rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of symantec s products or to obtain and use information that symantec regards as proprietary 
all of symantec s products are protected by copyright  and symantec has a number of patents and patent applications pending 
however  existing patent and copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect symantec s proprietary rights in its products to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
symantec s products are not copy protected 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  symantec believes that software developers will become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
this risk is potentially greater for companies  such as symantec  that obtain certain of their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions  since they have less direct control over the development of those products 
in addition  an increasing number of patents are being issued that are potentially applicable to software  and allegations of patent infringement are becoming increasingly common in the software industry 
it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims because new patents are being issued continually  the subject of patent applications is confidential until a patent is issued  and it may not be apparent even from a patent that has already been issued whether it is potentially applicable to a particular software product 
this increases the risk that symantec s products may be subject to claims of patent infringement 
although such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are time consuming and expensive to defend 
symantec has been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past  is currently involved in a number of such disputes and litigation  and may be involved in the future in such disputes and or litigation 
if symantec is alleged to infringe one or more patents  it may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license 
if litigation were to commence and a license were not available on reasonable terms or if another party were found to have a valid patent claim against symantec  such a result could have a material adverse affect on symantec s business  operating results and financial condition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
software defects and product liability 
software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
in the past  for example  symantec s anti virus software products have incorrectly detected viruses which do not exist 
although the company has not experienced any material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date  defects and errors could be found in current versions  future upgrades to current products or newly developed and released products  despite testing prior to release 
software defects could result in delays in market acceptance or unexpected reprogramming costs  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
while symantec has not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of the company s products  there can be no assurance that such viruses will not be created in the future 
the company s license agreements with its customers contain provisions designed to limit the exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such license agreements may not be valid as a result of federal  state  local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year product liability 
while the company believes that most of its currently developed and actively marketed products are year compliant for significantly all functionality  these software products could contain errors or defects related to the year versions of the company s products which are not the most currently released or which are not currently being developed may not be year compliant 
the company sells some of its older product lines  which are not being actively developed and updated  as such these products are not necessarily year compliant 
symantec is currently party to a lawsuit related to the alleged inability of pre version norton antivirus products to function properly in respect to year symantec believes that this lawsuit has no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously 
the final resolution of this lawsuit is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company  although it is not possible to estimate the possible loss 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of this lawsuit  it is possible that the company s future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
year corporate systems 
the company has completed an assessment of its computer systems and software and is modifying or replacing portions of its software so that its operating systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company is currently evaluating system interfaces with third party systems  such as those of key suppliers  distributors and financial institutions  for year functionality 
the year project cost is not expected to be material 
the project is estimated to be significantly completed during the calendar year 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
additionally  the systems of other companies with which symantec does business may not address any year problems on a timely basis  which could have an adverse affect on symantec s systems or business transactions 
as testing of year functionality of the company s systems must occur in a simulated environment  the company will not be able to test full system year interfaces and capabilities prior to year the company believes that its exposure on year issues is not material to its business as a whole
