item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary strategic initiative of management involves improving the results of the company s core business and  as capital is available  increasing the number of fitness centers it operates through the replication of its profitable new fitness center prototype 
in  the company began building more efficient fitness centers by eliminating pools and other wet areas and racquet sports all of which are costly to build and maintain and which have significantly lower utilization rates  and replacing much of that space with expanded workout areas which receive a higher degree of member use 
at approximately the same time  the company emphasized member payment plans using eft for financed memberships by adjusting sales commissions and member incentives 
the company s experience has indicated better collection results for financed memberships sold under eft plans compared to those sold with standard coupon book payment plans 
eft financed memberships represented approximately of the total membership contracts in the receivables portfolio at december  over the past several years  membership types and pricing options were standardized  making the selling process less complicated for both the customer and sales personnel 
in august  the company implemented a program to increase monthly dues for contracts sold after that date and in late  began to curtail the practice of discounting dues for multiple year renewal offers 
following the stock offering  the company began emphasizing the sale of all club memberships  which are typically financed  rather than the sale of single club memberships 
the company believes all of these actions  certain of which reduced new membership unit sales and revenues  will ultimately improve cash flows and operating income 
in addition  management made certain changes designed to integrate operations and reduce operating costs  including personnel costs  advertising expenses and other operating expenses 
as part of its continuing cost reduction program  the company began a long term consolidation project in and computer conversion in for its rscs 
the consolidation of five rscs into two remaining rscs was completed in the third quarter of  and the elimination of cost redundancies continued throughout and the primary phase of the computer conversion was completed in the fourth quarter of with the addition of new hardware and software  the company streamlined its processing procedures and developed efficiencies that enable the rscs to service members better while reducing costs 
the company has completed an assessment of whether its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in and thereafter and has determined that only two existing software applications require modification  with such modifications expected to be completed in at an aggregate cost of less than 
million 
the rate of the company s provision for doubtful receivables can vary from year to year 
the company estimates the ultimate realization of initial membership fees originated on financed memberships based upon a number of factors such as method of payment eft vs 
coupon books and amount of downpayment  among others 
the company continually analyzes the provision because initial membership fees can be paid to the company in installments 
updated collection experience trends are reviewed each reporting period and  if necessary  the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
changes in the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables may result from various factors including significant near term fluctuations in amounts of initial membership fees originated for financed memberships or the timing of write offs 
the company believes  based on its experience  that the qualitative profile of its receivables portfolio at december  is generally improved from that in recent years due to more accounts paying by eft and higher average downpayments 
management also believes significant opportunities exist to increase revenues beyond those generated by the sale of membership plans and receipt of dues without significant capital expenditures 
to capitalize on the company s strong brand identity  extensive distribution infrastructure approximately facilities  significant member base approximately four million members and frequency of visitation more than million member visits in each of and  management has implemented the following new initiatives i the introduction of a newly developed personal training program now being offered at most of its fitness centers  ii the sale of an exclusive line of bally branded nutritional products to the company s members  iii the sale of nutritional products  workout apparel and related accessories in bfit essentials tm retail stores currently located in over of its fitness centers  and iv the provision of affordable  comprehensive outpatient rehabilitative and physical therapy services to both members and nonmembers  presently in two of its fitness centers 
these new initiatives had a limited effect on the results  but beginning with  management expects their effect to be more meaningful 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  net revenues for were million compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is substantially a result of an increase in initial membership fees originated of million in  consisting of a million increase in financed memberships originated offset  in part  by a million decrease in paid in full memberships originated 
these results generally reflect management s current strategy of selling more all club membership plans which typically have been financed and generate better long term returns for the company and fewer single club membership plans 
accordingly  the average selling price of contracts sold increased and the number of contracts sold decreased 
further  these results were achieved while the average number of fitness centers selling memberships decreased from in to in  reflecting management s continuing strategy to improve the quality of the company s facilities 
during and  the company closed older  typically smaller and less profitable facilities and sold a fitness center to a franchisee while opening new  larger facilities  generally based on its new prototype 
in addition  deferred revenue accounting added only million to revenues in compared to million in dues collected increased million over  reflecting the company s continuing strategy of increasing renewal dues 
finance charges earned increased million in due primarily to the increase in the size of the receivables portfolio

operating income for was million compared to million in the increase of 
million was due to the aforementioned increase in revenues substantially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  which includes a million increase in the provision for doubtful receivables 
operating expenses include charges of million and million in and  respectively million and million of which is amortization of unearned compensation in and  respectively relating to restricted stock awards issued in conjunction with the spin off for which restrictions lapsed in and and final vesting occurred in august excluding the provision for doubtful receivables and charges related to restricted stock awards  operating costs and expenses increased million from fitness center operating expenses increased million due  in part  to increased spending to improve club operations and appearance  additional commissions a substantial portion of which are deferred through the change in deferred membership origination costs from the growth in initial membership fees originated  and certain operating costs associated with the new initiatives described above 
general and administrative expenses increased million and primarily reflects fees paid to hilton hotels corporation in under a license agreement to use the name bally a similar payment was not required in  an increase of tax gross up expense in from relating to the restricted stock awards described above and increased corporate personnel and other overhead incurred in relating principally to the new initiatives 
member processing and collection center expenses decreased million  reflecting decreases in telephone expenses as a result of renegotiated rates and fewer member service calls  printing and equipment rental costs 
in addition  advertising expenses decreased million due to reduced spending on television advertisements and the elimination of certain agency fees in offset  in part  by increases in production costs and local promotional activities 
the provision for doubtful receivables for was million compared to million in  an increase of million primarily due to the increase in financed memberships originated 
interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million primarily due to lower average interest rates and an increase in the amount of capitalized interest offset  in part  by a higher average level of debt 
the income tax provision for reflects state income taxes only  as no federal benefit has been provided because the ultimate realization of additional deferred tax assets cannot be assured 
the income tax benefit for reflects a benefit equal to the federal provision allocated to the extraordinary item no additional benefit has been provided because the ultimate realization of additional deferred tax assets cannot be assured  net of a state income tax provision 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  net revenues for were million compared to million in the decrease in revenues results  in part  because the average number of fitness centers selling memberships decreased from in to in  reflecting the closure of older  typically smaller and less profitable facilities and the sale of a fitness center to entertainment offset  in part  by the opening of new  larger facilities during and initial membership fees originated decreased million in  consisting of a million decrease in financed memberships originated and a million decrease in paid in full memberships originated 
the number of contracts sold declined and the average selling price of contracts sold increased as a result of the sale of more premium memberships in dues collected increased million over despite the reduction in the average number of facilities operated  reflecting the company s continuing strategy of increasing renewal dues 
finance charges earned decreased 
million in compared to fees and other revenues decreased million primarily due to the reduction of personal trainer revenue in as a result of temporarily outsourcing the service and non recurring income in pertaining to insurance recoveries 
operating income for was million compared to million in the increase of million was due to a million reduction in operating costs and expenses offset  in part  by the aforementioned decrease in revenues 
the reduction in operating costs and expenses was achieved despite an million increase in the provision for doubtful receivables and a million charge related to restricted stock awards issued in conjunction with the spin off for which restrictions lapsed due to the increase in the market price of the common stock 
excluding the provision for doubtful receivables and charge related to restricted stock awards  operating costs and expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to reductions in fitness center operating expenses and member processing and collection center expenses 
fitness center operating expenses for decreased million from primarily due to a reduction in payroll and related costs and other variable costs as a result of the continuing cost reduction program and the reduction in the average number of fitness centers operated in compared to in addition  insurance expenses declined due to favorable experience in controlling general liability risks  and commissions decreased as a result of the decline in initial membership fees originated 
member processing and collection center expenses decreased million primarily due to the aforementioned rsc consolidation and computer projects 
the provision for doubtful receivables for was million compared to million in  an increase of million despite the aforementioned decrease in financed memberships originated 
management believes the additional provision for doubtful receivables in adequately reserved for collection experience to be ultimately realized from sales programs in general  and specifically from sales promotions allowing very low downpayments offered from time to time between july and october that have shown indications of underperforming historical collection experience 
interest expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million principally reflecting a higher average level of debt offset  in part  by lower average interest rates 
as a result of the spin off  the company is no longer included in the consolidated federal income tax return of entertainment and files its own separate consolidated federal income tax return 
accordingly  the income tax benefit for reflects a benefit equal to the federal provision allocated to the extraordinary item no additional benefit has been provided because the ultimate realization of additional deferred tax assets cannot be assured  net of a state income tax provision 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with entertainment  the effective rate of the income tax benefit for was lower than the us statutory tax rate due principally to operating losses without a current year tax benefit and non deductible amortization of costs in excess of acquired assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company is in the process of expanding and upgrading its facilities in order to increase its membership base and more effectively capitalize on its streamlined marketing and administrative functions 
management plans to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million annually to maintain and make minor upgrades to the company s existing facilities  including exercise equipment upgrades  hvac and other operating equipment upgrades and replacements  and locker room and workout area refurbishments  among others 
in addition  the company expects to invest approximately million during the next year to complete its plans to extensively add and upgrade exercise equipment  refresh interior and exterior finishes to improve club ambience  and refurbish and make major upgrades to approximately of its clubs  including converting some low usage pools and racquet areas into expanded exercise areas and to a lesser extent retail and outpatient rehabilitative and physical therapy service areas 
for the last several years  the company has spent million to million annually  as funds were available  to open new or replacement facilities 
beginning in  the company intends to increase its spending to approximately million to million per year to open to new facilities based on its new prototype  which is designed to cost less to construct and maintain than the company s older facilities 
the new facilities are expected to range in size from  to  square feet and have the capacity to accommodate significantly more members than older clubs of the same size because they will generally focus on only the most widely used amenities 
during  the company repaid approximately million of indebtedness  including the repayment of amounts drawn under the company s credit facility  from the net proceeds of the stock offering  and used approximately million to support the introduction of new initiatives 
cash receipts from the sale of paid in full memberships during the six months ended december  were approximately million less than during the six months ended june  due to the company s emphasis on the sale of financed membership plans 
this emphasis during the last six months of resulted in a corresponding increase of approximately million in net installment contracts receivable from june  to december  prior to completing the stock offering  the company was dependent on availability under its credit facility and its operations to provide for cash needs 
the company managed liquidity requirements in recent years by emphasizing the sale of single club paid in full membership plans and accelerating collections of financed memberships and dues to increase available cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  sales of non strategic assets and sale leaseback arrangements 
management believes use of these techniques has had a negative impact on operating results  and that available working capital has reduced the need for these techniques to be continued
