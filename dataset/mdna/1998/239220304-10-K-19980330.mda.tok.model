item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
all data in the tables are in thousands  except for percentages and per share data 
the company is an integrated systems solution provider of cleanrooms and cleanroom component systems for the semiconductor industry 
in recent years  the company has typically had one to three significant customers  each of which accounted for more than of the company s annual revenues  these customers do not necessarily remain significant in subsequent years 
the semiconductor industry has been historically cyclical in nature and continues to be adversely affected by a cyclical downturn that began in the current industry downturn has resulted in lower capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers during the third and fourth quarters of and throughout management believes the downturn is nearing its end but may continue through the first and second quarters of how quickly any recovery will take place is still subject to significant uncertainty 
the downturn has resulted in fewer contracts available to bid  a significant increase in price competition on contracts that were awarded  and reduced margins on such contracts 
during  the company experienced fewer new contract awards resulting in a decrease in the company s backlog from million at december  to million at december  although the company has experienced an increase in the contract bidding activity during the third and fourth quarters of compared to each of the previous four quarters  management believes that the above described events adversely affected its revenues and results of operations for and anticipates the industry downturn will continue to adversely affect its revenues and profitability through the first and second quarters of although there is uncertainty surrounding the timing of a recovery in the semiconductor industry  management continues to believe that changes taking place in the industry should result in expanded semiconductor industry capital expenditures in the long term 
delays in the ramp up of mm technology have delayed the expected construction of the whole series of mm fabs worldwide 
due  in part  to the lack of mm process tools  weaker than expected demand  and the current focus on lowering process geometries from 
m to 
m  the mm effort has slowed by at least twelve months 
in response to the current downturn  management has taken steps to reduce the company s cost structure including a reduction in the company s work force of more than thirty percent during during  management will monitor the company s cost structure and take appropriate actions as considered necessary  but continue to develop state of the art cleanroom technology and provide world class support to the company s customers 
the company s contract revenue and operating results fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on such factors as the timing of significant customer orders  the timing of revenue and cost recognition  variations in contract mix  changes in customer buying patterns  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  utilization of capacity  manufacturing productivity and efficiency  availability of key components and trends in the economies of the geographical regions in which the company operates 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
the company recognizes revenue in proportion to the costs incurred to date in relation to the total anticipated costs 
revenue recognized may not be the same as progress billings to the customer 
underbillings are reflected in an asset account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress  and overbillings are reflected in a liability account billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts in progress 
the company generates revenue in three geographic regions  north america  asia pacific rim and europe 
contracts in the asia pacific rim region are generally denominated in united states dollars 
although risk of fluctuations in currency value does not affect such dollar denominated contracts  changes in the relative value of the dollar could make the company less competitive in this region 
contracts to be performed in europe may be denominated in local currency  and the company bears the risk of changes in the relative value of the dollar and the local currencies 
devaluation of world currencies against the us dollar has created extreme price competitiveness from korean  japanese  and german manufacturers and integrators of systems 
the collapse of the korean marketplace in particular  has forced korean suppliers to look outside their historical business relationships for new markets 
the company has in the past and may in the future attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such hedging will fully insulate the company from fluctuations or will not expose the company to additional risks of loss 
the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
results of operations contract revenue change change contract revenue thousands    contract revenue for decreased by to million from million in this decrease is directly related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
the downturn has resulted in fewer contracts being constructed during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the decrease in the company s backlog at december  compared to the backlog at december  is attributed to fewer contracts available to bid 
during  contract revenue increased by to million from million in the increase in revenues is attributable to a large backlog at the beginning of that resulted in strong contract activity in the first half of and numerous large contracts that the company was awarded during the first and second quarters of that resulted in additional revenue as the contracts progressed during the third and fourth quarters of north america contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue north america decreased to in compared to in the decrease in contract revenue is attributed to the semiconductor industry downturn resulting in fewer and smaller contracts available during than in contract revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue north america increased to in compared to in the increase is the result of numerous contracts received in north america 
these contracts were larger than the company had received historically and were completed on schedules that were much faster than the company had historically been required to perform 
asia pacific rim contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue asia pacific revenue increased to in compared to in the fluctuation is attributed to the worldwide semiconductor industry downturn compounded by the uncertainty of the asian financial environment 
several large cleanroom projects that were in the bidding process have been delayed indefinitely 
the delays in these projects had a major impact on asia pacific revenue during the fourth quarter of contract revenue for decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue asia pacific decreased to in compared to in two factors contributed to the decrease in asia pacific revenue 
first  during the company recognized revenue for two significantly large contracts in taiwan 
these contracts were substantially completed during second  the semiconductor industry downturn impacted taiwan and other asian countries to the extent that the company did not have the same opportunity to bid on contracts in that it had during europe contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue european revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease is attributed to two factors 
first  the worldwide semiconductor industry downturn has delayed the investment into the european community by most major semiconductor manufacturers resulting in fewer contracts available during compared to second  during the company was involved in an unusually large project in france that generated a significant amount of revenue during that was not available to the company during contract revenue for increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue europe increased to in compared to in the increase is attributed to two contracts of significant size received in early and substantially completed by the end of the year 
gross profit change change gross profit thousands    percentage of contract revenue gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit decreased as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for the decrease in gross margin is the direct result of the semiconductor industry downturn see discussion above 
the downturn has resulted in a competitive bidding process  and contracts awarded during are at margins less than the company experienced in in addition  contract sizes through were significantly smaller 
gross profit for increased by to million from million in and increased as a percentage of contract revenue to in from in this increase is the result of continual improvement in the company s manufacturing facility creating greater efficiencies and less costs to produce product  and better project management resulting in less problems at the construction sites which allows the company to install its product with less time and labor expense 
contracts received during also were generally bid at higher margins than those received during also affecting the increase from to were significant events during that contributed to the company realizing smaller margins during these events included the company s continued expansion of manufacturing facilities and a product failure during the second quarter of the expansion created manufacturing inefficiencies  project delays and overruns resulting in higher than expected cost of contracts during the product failure was the result of defective motors purchased from a third party vendor and resulted in a one time charge to costs of contracts of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative expenses thousands    percentage of contract revenue selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million  from million  but increased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in actual dollars spent on selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with is the result a reduction in general and administrative headcount completed during the first and second quarters of selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million  or of contract revenue  from million  or of contract revenue  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is the result of increased sales activity during compared with worldwide and a full year of costs associated with the company s asia pacific office 
the asia pacific office was only operational for six months during selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue has remained relatively constant from to research and development change change research and development expense thousands percentage of contract revenue research and development expense decreased slightly in actual dollars spent from to this decrease was not material 
management believes that the company will increase its research and development expenses during  both in actual dollars spent and as a percentage of revenue in order to develop innovative products  to be on the cutting edge of the millimeter manufacturing facility technology and to modify existing products to be less expensive to produce and easier to install 
research and development expense increased slightly from to this increase was the result of research and development projects that were based on specific customers and contracts 
depreciation and amortization change change depreciation and amortization expense thousands percentage of contract revenue depreciation and amortization expense during increased by to  or of contract revenue  from  or of contract revenue  in this increase is the result of a full years depreciation expense on leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software purchased during depreciation and amortization expense in increased by to  or of contract revenue  from  or of contract revenue  in this increase is the result of the purchase of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software required for the increased sales  marketing and administrative activities during other income expense  net change change other income expense thousands percentage of contract revenue other income expense decreased in to  from  in the decrease in other income expense is the result of foreign currency losses recognized during resulting from the decline in taiwan dollars throughout and a litigation settlement included as part of other income during other income expense increased in to  from  in the increase is generally the result of the net effect of an increase in interest expense and a settlement on litigation with a third party vendor for defective motors 
income taxes benefit change change income taxes expense benefit thousands   percentage of contract revenue the effective tax rate benefit for was approximately compared to for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is primarily the result of a tax benefit resulting from the loss before taxes  calculated at the statutory federal rate see note i of notes to financial statements 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of tax benefits the company was able to utilize during on foreign sales which were taxed in the company s foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this includes cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and respectively 
receivables  including retentions  see note d of notes to financial statements decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was the result of lower revenues from fewer contracts during compared to days sales outstanding the ratio between receivables  excluding retention  and average daily revenue taken over the year decreased to days at december   from days at december the company s operations provided million of cash during  compared to using million of cash in during  the company experienced a decrease in receivables of million as a result of the decline in revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
at december   the company had a line of credit totaling million or the available borrowing base 
the company had million in borrowings against the line at december  amounts drawn under the line bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  and are due no later than june   with options to renew the agreement on an annual basis 
the line is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  at december   the company maintained a guidance line of credit with a domestic bank used to facilitate the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility allows for letters of credit to be issued up to the lesser of million or the available borrowing base 
no letters of credit were open under this facility at december  the facility expires july   with options to renew the agreement on an annual basis 
during  the company used  for the purchase of property and equipment 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures in for routine additions and replacements of property  plant  and equipment will be approximately million 
these purchases will be financed through long term debt or capital leases 
management believes that existing cash balances  borrowings available under the lines of credit  and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements through december  however  in the event the company experiences adverse operating performance or above anticipated capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms if at all 
impact of future accounting pronouncements none 
see notes to financial statements a factors affecting future results the company s future operations will be impacted by  among other factors  the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the company s operations are also subject to additional risks and uncertainties that could result in actual operating results differing materially from anticipated operating results and past operating results and trends 
these risks and uncertainties include pricing pressures  cancellations of existing contracts  timing of significant customer orders  increased competition  and changes in semiconductor and cleanroom technology
