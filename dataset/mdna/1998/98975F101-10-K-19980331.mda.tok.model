item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview from the company s inception in through  the company derived the substantial majority of its revenue from dfps and vsps used principally in military  industrial and medical applications 
in  the company repositioned its business to develop and market data compression products for the evolving multimedia markets and discontinued development of dfp and vsp products 
in  the company discontinued production of these products  which are not expected to contribute significant revenues in future periods 
the company s current lines of multimedia compression products include jpeg based products used in video editing systems and filmless digital cameras  mpeg based products used in video playback and dolby digital based audio products used in movie and home theater systems and dvd players 
in december  the company acquired compcore  a provider of software based compression products and a designer of cores for video and audio decoder integrated circuits 
in the acquisition  the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of compcore 
the company also assumed all outstanding options to purchase compcore common stock  which were exchanged for options to purchase approximately  shares of zoran common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and the financial statements of the company and the information herein have been restated to include the results of compcore for all periods 
historically  average selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry in general  and for the company s products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
although asps for the company s hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  these fluctuations have been driven principally by changes in customer mix oem sales versus sales to distributors and the transition from low volume to high volume production sales rather than by factors related to product life cycles 
during and  the company reduced its asps on certain products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
the company believes that  as its product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  it is likely to experience further declines in the asps of its products  although the timing and amount of such future changes cannot be predicted with any certainty 
there can be no assurance that costs will decrease at the same rate as such declines in asps or at all 
the company sells its products  either directly or through distributors or independent sales representatives  to oems worldwide 
sales prices to distributors are generally lower than prices for direct sales  as distributors are responsible for certain sales and marketing expenses  maintenance of inventories  customer support and training 
lower gross margins on sales to distributors are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
product sales in japan are primarily made through fujifilm  the company s strategic partner and distributor in japan 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than zoran s other distributors 
zoran has historically generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided the company with partial funding for the development of certain of its products 
payments received by the company under these development contracts are recorded as development revenue 
the company classifies all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
the company retains ownership of the intellectual property developed by it under these development contracts 
while the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  it expects development revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
the company is a party to certain research and development agreements with the chief scientist and birdf  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require the company to use its best efforts to achieve specified results and require the company to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in israel through its wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
as a result  certain expenses are incurred in israeli shekels 
until may  substantially all of the company s product sales were made from the company s us facility 
in may  the company restructured its manufacturing and sales organizations and began selling a portion of its products directly from its facility in israel 
to date  substantially all of the company s product sales and its development and licensing revenue have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in us dollars 
the company expects that most of its sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
the company has not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations 
the company intends to actively monitor its foreign exchange exposure and to take appropriate action to reduce its foreign exchange risk  if such risk becomes material 
in october  the company contributed technology relating to its ghost cancellation products to a newly formed company the joint venture and to the joint venture s subsidiary  oren semiconductor  ltd 
oren  and an unrelated third party contributed cash  each in exchange for a equity interest in the joint venture 
since the organization of the joint venture  efforts relating to the development and marketing of ghost cancellation products have been conducted by the joint venture  through oren 
in september  the company approved the transfer of its interest in the joint venture  and  in cash  to gc holdings corporation holdings  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  as holdings initial capital and declared a dividend to its stockholders of all of its stock in holdings 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales software  licensing and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative merger and related total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in from million in product sales decreased by to million in from million in the decreases in product sales resulted primarily from unit sales and revenue decreases for the company s dolby digital audio compression ics due to delays in the development of the dvd market 
these decreases were partially offset by unit sales and revenue increases for the company s jpeg based products used in desktop video editing 
software  licensing and development revenues increased by to million in from million in this increase was due to significant new licensing contracts for software and hardware design as well as progress on long term development contracts in place from the prior year 
product sales consist of revenues from sales of the company s integrated circuits 
software  licensing and development revenue consists of revenue from license and royalty agreements  primarily for audio and video decoder software  that generally provide for the license of software for a specified period of time for either a single fee or a fee based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
development revenue is derived from hardware design contracts that provide for license and milestone payments to be made at specified times 
product gross profit 
product gross margin increased by to in  compared to in the increase was due to a product sales mix that included an increased percentage of higher margin products  an increased percentage of products sold directly to oem customers and lower manufacturing costs during product gross profit consists of product sales less cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
the company s product gross margin is dependent on product mix and on the percentage of products sold directly to the company s oem customers versus indirectly through its marketing partners who purchase the company s products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses 
the company expects product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing further fluctuations in margins 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was a result of the planned enhancement of the company s technology and development capabilities in conjunction with the company s growth in general and its increased software  licensing and development revenue 
r d expenses in were net of reimbursements in the amounts of  under product development agreements with the chief scientist 
there were no such reimbursements during r d expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in r d expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
the company continues to believe that significant investments in r d are required for it to remain competitive and expects to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to product market development and to support planned revenue growth 
sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  royalties  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
the company expects that sg a expenses will continue to increase to support the anticipated growth of the company 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income increased by to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from decreased interest expense as a result of the repayment of the company s remaining debt during provision for income taxes 
the company s estimated effective tax rate decreased to for from in the decrease was primarily due the tax benefits derived from revenue and net income attributable the company s operations in israel which receives favorable tax treatment

total revenues increased by to million in from million in product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases in product sales resulted primarily from continued growth in unit sales of the company s dolby digital audio decoders  which are used in home audio equipment and dvd players 
although sales of these products increased substantially from  there were delays during in the development of the dvd market 
in addition  unit sales of the company s jpeg devices increased in compared to this increase reflected development of the markets for video editing and digital filmless cameras  although the market for consumer oriented video editing equipment developed more slowly than had been anticipated 
unit sales increases in these product lines were partially offset by lower asps due to volume pricing and a higher proportion of sales to fujifilm 
product sales for also reflected revenue from an advance payment deferred in prior periods and recognized in the third quarter of upon the completion of a multi year sales program with one of the company s strategic partners 
software  licensing and development revenue increased by to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in software licensing contracts 
product gross profit 
product gross margin decreased by to in from in the decrease in product gross margin was primarily due to higher volume sales of relatively lower priced  lower margin dolby digital based products and certain jpeg based products sold to fujifilm  the company s strategic partner  customer and distributor in japan 
the decrease in product gross margin in was partially offset by revenues recognized upon completion of the multi year contract with a strategic partner 
without the benefit of these revenues  product gross margin for would have been 
product gross margin in was also positively impacted by sales of high margin  end of life dfp and vsp products  primarily in the first quarter

interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income and expense resulted in net other income of million in compared to net other expense of  in interest expense decreased due to the use of proceeds from the initial public offering of the company s common stock the ipo in december to repay debt 
interest income increased due to the investment of the ipo proceeds  including proceeds from the january exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  for from  for the company s tax provision for primarily reflected foreign withholding taxes  income taxes on compcore s earnings and alternative minimum tax on zoran s domestic earnings 
liquidity and capital resources until the ipo in december  the company had financed its operations primarily through private placements of equity securities and  to a lesser extent borrowings from banks and its stockholders 
prior to the ipo  net proceeds from the sale of the company s equity securities aggregated million 
net proceeds from the ipo and the exercise of certain warrants in connection with the ipo and net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in january totaled million 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of working capital

the company s capital expenditures totaled million in and million in capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
the company had no bank debt at december  or at december  the company believes that its current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with existing sources of liquidity and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and capital equipment requirements through future performance and risk factors the company s future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
product concentration  evolving markets 
since the company s markets are still evolving  only a limited number of commercial and consumer products that incorporate the company s integrated circuits are currently in volume production 
current applications for the company s products include professional and consumer video editing systems  pc based and stand alone video cd and dvd players  digital audio systems  filmless digital cameras and video conferencing systems 
during and  the company derived a majority of its product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for video editing applications 
video editing applications continued to account for the largest percentage of the company s product sales in and delays in the development of the dvd market resulted in decreased sales of the company s audio products in compared to the company expects that sales of its devices for video capture and editing applications and digital audio applications will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues for the near future 
over the longer term  the company s ability to generate increased revenues will be dependent on the expansion of sales of its products for use in other existing applications  as well as the development and acceptance of new applications for the company s technologies and products 
the potential size of the markets for new applications and the timing of their development and acceptance is uncertain 
the company s future success will depend upon whether manufacturers select the company s integrated circuits and software for incorporation into their products  and upon the successful marketing of these products by the manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that demand for existing applications will be sustained  that new markets will develop or that manufacturers developing products for any of these markets will design the company s integrated circuits into their products or successfully market them 
the failure of existing and new markets to develop or to be receptive to the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the emergence of markets for the company s integrated circuits will be affected by a variety of factors beyond the company s control 
in particular  the company s products are designed to conform with certain current industry standards 
there can be no assurance that manufacturers will continue to follow these standards or that competing standards will not emerge which will be preferred by manufacturers 
the emergence of markets for the company s products is also dependent in part upon third party content providers developing and marketing content for end user systems  such as video and audio playback systems  in a format compatible with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors beyond the company s control will not adversely affect the development of markets for the company s products 
see item business strategy and markets and applications 
reliance on independent foundries and contractors 
the company does not operate any manufacturing facilities  and from time to time shortages of foundry capacity develop for certain process technologies in the semiconductor industry 
the company currently relies on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of its products 
the company s independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
the company does not have a long term supply contract with either tsmc or motorola  its principal suppliers  and  therefore  neither tsmc nor motorola is obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
see item business manufacturing 
the company s reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
the company obtains foundry capacity through forecasts that are generated in advance of expected delivery dates and places its purchase orders up to three months prior to scheduled delivery 
the company s ability to obtain the foundry capacity necessary to meet the future demand for its products is based in part on its ability to accurately forecast future demand 
due to periodic limitations on semiconductor foundry capacity  if the company fails to accurately forecast its future demand  the company may be unable to obtain adequate supplies of integrated circuits on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately forecast the future demand for its products or obtain sufficient foundry capacity in the future 
in addition  the company s obligation to place purchase orders in advance of delivery subjects the company to inventory risks  including the risk of obsolescence 
while the company has not experienced any material disruptions in supply to date  there can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not occur in the future 
in the event that any of the company s foundries are unable or unwilling to produce sufficient supplies of the company s products  in required volumes at acceptable costs  the company will be required to reallocate production among its other existing foundries or to identify and qualify acceptable alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available to the company or would be in a position to satisfy the company s production requirements on a timely basis 
the loss of any of the company s foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company in a period of increased demand for its products to expand supply or the company s inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from its current or future suppliers could reduce or delay shipments of the company s products 
any of these developments could damage relationships with the company s current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
all of the company s semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of two independent contractors  asat and anam  and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
see item business manufacturing 
the company s reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits its control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the provision of services by the company s assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of the company s products 
these constraints or delays could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
new product development and timely introduction of new and enhanced products 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the company expects to increase its expenses relating to product development  and its future success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that meet changing customer requirements and industry standards 
the development and introduction of new semiconductor products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends  the successful and timely completion of product development  the ability of the company to convince its customers to incorporate the company s products into the design of their own products  the securing of sufficient foundry capacity and the achievement of acceptable wafer yields by the company s independent foundries 
development of new product designs can often require significant expenditures by the company  which expenditures may precede volume sales of the new product  if any  by a year or more 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by the company typically contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see item business industry background and research and development 
competition  pricing pressures 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining asps and rapid product obsolescence 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will continue to compete favorably or that the company will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing or new competitors 
in addition  increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see item business competition 
customer concentration  changes in customer mix 
the company s largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of its revenues  and sales to these large customers have varied materially from year to year 
see item business customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key customers or that such customers will not cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases 
in addition  sales to these key customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
any development that would result in a substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more key customers  including actions by competitors or technological changes  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  any development that would adversely affect the collectability of account balances from one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
fluctuations in operating results  net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products and products of its customers  the timing of large customer orders  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  and competitive pricing pressures 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the emergence of new industry standards  product obsolescence  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating the company s integrated circuits and software and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  a downturn in the markets for its customer s products  particularly the consumer electronics market  or order cancellations or reschedulings 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
the company places orders to purchase its products from independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from its customers 
if anticipated shipments or development revenue in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
a significant portion of the company s expenses is relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s expectations it may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
to date  the company s operating results have not been materially affected by seasonal factors 
however  as markets for consumer products incorporating the company s integrated circuits mature  the company expects that sales will tend to be stronger during the last several months of the calendar year than at other times due to increased demand for consumer products during the holiday season 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company s future net income and cash flow will also be affected by its ability to apply its net operating losses nols  which totaled approximately million for federal tax reporting purposes as of december   against taxable income in future periods 
under the tax reform act of  the utilization of nols may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including a cumulative ownership change of greater than over a three year period 
the consummation of the ipo in december resulted in a cumulative ownership change of greater than 
accordingly  the company s nols incurred prior to the consummation of the ipo that can be utilized to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes will be limited to approximately million per year 
the company does not believe that its acquisition of compcore in december adversely affected its ability to utilize its nols 
however  future changes of ownership could further limit the company s utilization of nols and could have an adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
beginning in  the company s israeli subsidiary has benefitted from its status as an approved enterprise pursuant to the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   as amended 
there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws in the united states or israel or in the company s status will not limit the company s ability to utilize its nols or its approved enterprise status 
any limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nols or its approved enterprise status could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
risks associated with customer funded research and development 
the company historically has generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided the company with partial funding for the development of certain of its products 
under these contracts  the company receives payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
see item business research and development 
the company intends to continue to enter into development contracts with strategic partners  although it expects development revenue to remain relatively constant or decrease  and to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
the company s failure to achieve the milestones specified in its existing development contracts  the termination of existing contracts or the company s inability to secure future development contracts could have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
possible transactions to obtain additional foundry capacity 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  the company has considered and will continue to consider various transactions  which could include  among other things  equity investments from  option payments or other prepayments to  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity  contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods or joint ventures or other partnership relationships with foundries 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all or that such arrangements  if any  will be on terms favorable to the company 
if the company were not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  its business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
see item business manufacturing 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the company may require substantial additional capital to finance its future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund its ongoing research and development activities beyond the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  acceptance of and demand for the company s products  the types of arrangements that the company may enter into with its independent foundries and the extent to which the company invests in new technology and research and development projects 
to the extent that the company s existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund the company s activities  the company may need to raise additional funds 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company s stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s common stock 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  it will be available on terms favorable to the company 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced growth and expansion which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its administrative  operational and financial resources and has resulted  and will continue to result  in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company anticipates that future growth  if any  will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully will also require the company to continue to expand and improve its administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of the company s key operations  including the major portion of its research and development operations and a significant portion of its sales and administrative operations  are located in israel  while a majority of its sales and marketing and certain of its research and development and administrative personnel  including its president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations is likely to place additional strain on the company s resources and its ability to effectively manage its growth 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
recently completed acquisition 
on december   the company acquired compcore 
the managements of the company and compcore undertook the merger with the expectation that the merger would result in beneficial synergies for the companies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether the integration of the two companies businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner 
the combination of the two companies has required  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and technology and coordination of their research and development  sales and marketing  and financial reporting efforts 
certain aspects of the integration are still in process  and there can be no assurance that it will be completed smoothly or successfully 
if significant difficulties are encountered in the integration of the existing product lines and technology  resources could be diverted from new product development  resulting in delays in new product introductions 
the difficulties of such integration have been increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations with distinct cultures 
the integration of certain operations continue to require the dedication of management and other personnel resources which may temporarily distract from the day to day business of the company 
in addition  certain former officers and key employees of compcore are no longer with the company 
there can be no assurance that other former compcore employees will remain employed by the company 
failure to successfully complete the integration of the two companies operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on intellectual property  licensed products  risk of disputes and litigation 
the company s ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology and information 
although the company relies on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect certain of its intellectual property  the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel and the success of its ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining its competitive position 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  distributors  customers and potential customers and limits access to its proprietary information 
the company currently holds several united states patents  and has additional patent applications pending  that pertain to technologies and processes relating to the company s current business 
there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property rights  if challenged  will be upheld as valid  will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or will prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely in these countries 
the company sells its dolby digital based products under a perpetual  non exclusive license from dolby which permits the company to incorporate dolby s digital algorithm into its products 
the company s customers enter into license agreements with dolby pursuant to which they pay royalties directly to dolby 
under the company s agreement with dolby  the company may sell its dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for the company s dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation involving the company  the company or its foundries are from time to time be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
litigation by or against the company relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that licenses would be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by the company s foundries of certain processes 
see item business proprietary rights and licenses 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its senior management 
the loss of key management personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of any of its key employees 
the company believes that its future success will also depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  both in the united states and in israel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition

sales to non us customers in  and accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues  and the company anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
in addition  substantially all of the company s semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with its international operations 
a substantial portion of the company s research and development and sales operations are located in the state of israel and  as of december   of the company s full time employees were located in israel  including a majority of the company s research and development personnel 
therefore  the company is directly affected by the political  economic and military conditions to which that country is subject 
in addition  many of the company s expenses in israel are paid in israeli shekels  thereby subjecting the company to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to economic pressures resulting from israel s generally high rate of inflation 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect of the company s business  operating results or financial condition

in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the future market price of the common stock 
risks related to year problem 
in the next two years  most companies could face a potentially serious information systems problem because many software applications and operational programs written in the past were designed to handle date formats with two digit years and thus may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could result in computers either outputting incorrect data or shutting down altogether when attempting to process a date such as the company has examined all of its critical software and operational applications as well as the software products it has sold and found no potential problems related to the year issue 
in addition  however  the company could be exposed to a potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of financial institutions and other third parties to adequately address the year problem 
the company intends to devote the necessary resources to identify and resolve year issues that may exist with third parties 
however  the comnpany cannot estimate the cost of this effort at this time  nor can any assurance be given that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition
