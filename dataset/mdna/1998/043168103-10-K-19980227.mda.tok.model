item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiary is based on the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
a and b liquidity and capital resources six months ended november  for the six months ended november   the company s main source of funds resulted from net income plus depreciation 
this source was offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in customer deposits 
the inventory increase results from a higher production load at november  due primarily from case tillage equipment 
customer deposits are from down payments on beet equipment 
this equipment was shipped during the six month period  consequently the decrease in customer deposits 
comparison of year ended may  with may  in fiscal year  the company used  of cash from operations compared to generating  cash from operations in fiscal year the decrease in cash from operations in fiscal year reflects an increase in inventories and receivables  offset in part by increased net income and payables 
in fiscal year  major capital expenditures included two acquisitions 
the first acquisition was a line of potato farming equipment and associated service parts 
the second acquisition was a line of grain wagons and associated service parts 
the acquisitions  which included fixed assets and inventory  were financed by the issuance of  shares of art s way common stock  loans from the state of iowa and local sources obtained through the state of iowa community development block grant program and borrowings under the company s short term line of credit 
comparison of year ended may  with may  cash provided by operations was used to reduce bank debt 
there were no major capital expenditures during the fiscal year 
cash generated from reductions in inventory and accounts receivable was used to reduce trade accounts payable 
the reduction in inventory and accounts receivable reflects the lower level of sales in the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year the company continues its emphasis on inventory reductions 
capital resources in august  the company refinanced its existing senior indebtedness with a new bank 
this new agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to  for operating needs based on a percentage of the company s accounts receivable and inventory and allows within the revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not exceeding  the interest on this credit facility is one and one half percent per annum in excess of the bank s referenced rate and two percent on the letter of credit sub facility and respectively at november  
management believes this credit line will allow the company to facilitate new product growth and provide for ongoing working capital needs 
future capital needs of the company will be met by cash from operations and additional borrowing 
the agreement also provides for a term loan in the principal amount of  the principal amount is repayable in monthly installments of  for twenty four months with the final payment due at the twenty fourth month unless the revolving credit facility is renewed 
in the event that the term of the revolving credit facility is subsequently extended  the term loan shall continue to amortize based upon the payment schedule outlined above 
the interest rate on this credit facility is one and one half percent in excess of the bank s reference rate 
all loans  advances and other obligations  liabilities and indebtedness of the company are secured by all present and future assets 
the company s current ratio during the three preceding fiscal years and its working capital are as shown in the following table november  may  may  may  current assets     current liabilities     working capital     current ratio the company believes its liquidity  capital resources  and borrowing capacity are adequate for its current and intended operations 
c results of operations six months ended november  sales increased due mainly to strength in sugar beet harvesting equipment and related service parts 
other strong areas included corn stalk shredders  where the company enjoyed its best season since  the supramix vertical feed mixer and our traditional grinder mixer products 
two areas of weakness in sales were the termination of our oem contract to make frames for a local fiberglass body manufacturer and our deliberate scaling back of logan potato equipment production in view of a dramatic downturn in potato prices and customer demand 
gross profits increased due to improved production efficiencies  a product mix of higher margin products and improved purchasing of raw materials 
warranty expenses were impacted adversely by  due to unanticipated problems with our new model beet harvester 
the company encountered learning curve expenses associated with the new tillage production for case 
operating expenses are up as the company added staff in engineering and sales to support our new product lines and to enhance our position in the beet and feed processing business and due to the reinstatement of the company s contribution to the employee l k retirement plan 
interest costs were up as the higher sales volumes required higher working capital requirements 
comparison of year ended may  with may  sales revenues for fy rose due to the acquisitions described above and returning strength in other areas of our existing business 
sales from the acquisitions exceeded  the feed processing business was up  and sales gains were made in our land maintenance line 
sales declined in the sugar beet equipment line as we deliberately delayed production beyond may  to minimize working capital  make manufacturing room for our new products  and to allow more time for the development of new features 
gross profit for fy rose on the higher sales volume  however fiscal year gross profit was impacted by a  inventory write down 
the ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales improved to from last year s prior to the write down 
this improvement in fy resulted from lower raw material costs and reduced warranty expense 
operating expenses were higher than fy the two acquisitions accounted for most of the increase  which included amortization of purchase costs and additional employees to support the acquisitions 
in addition  the company strengthened our beet equipment resources in the engineering area 
the wage reduction implemented in june was progressively restored which further increased operating expenses 
the ratio of expenses to sales fell from in fy to in fy interest expense was lower in fy when compared to fy improved manufacturing flow reduced working capital requirements throughout the year 
comparison of year ended may  with may  sales for fy were down  from fy sales 
this reduction in sales was in the company s two major areas of business sugar beet equipment and feed processing equipment 
sales of sugar beet equipment fell as the company adjusted dealer inventories from a wholesale sales push in feed processing sales were off due to extremely high cost of feed  primarily corn  which severely crimped the company s customers ability to purchase new machines 
sales of the company s other products  including service parts declined a more modest 
gross profit for fy fell on the lower sales volume  including a  inventory market write down taken in the fourth quarter 
without this write down  gross profit would have been down approximately 
the percent of cost of goods sold to net sales declined to from in fy  including the impact of the inventory write down 
before the inventory write down the percent of cost of goods sold was 
the improvement came about through significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and purchasing 
operating expenses were reduced almost from fy with the completion of the major new product initiative undertaken in fy and fy  engineering expenses were scaled back significantly  particularly in the area of prototype expense 
other major cut backs occurred in all areas of the company  resulting in the number of indirect and salaried employees at may  to be vs for the prior year 
operating expenses as a percent of net sales were and in fy and fy the reduction in expenses and improvement in the cost of goods sold percent has enabled the loss from operations to be reduced from fy interest expense fell from fy  as production schedules  inventories and accounts receivable were reduced 
other expenses were up significantly due to fees associated with the new loan agreement 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year changes in the rate are due almost entirely to research and development credits 
utilization of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at november  see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
year issues many computer systems and software programs  including several used by the company require modification and conversion to allow data code fields to accept dates beginning with the year major system failures or erroneous calculations can result if computer systems are not year compliant 
the company is currently assessing its year issues  and is being advised by a substantial majority of its vendors and suppliers that certain of their products are year compliant or can be upgraded or will not be affected by the year problem 
the company s business could be materially adversely affected if the company s computer based systems are not year compliant in a timely manner  the company incurs significant additional expenses pursuing year compliant products  the company s vendors do not provide in a timely manner year compliant products  or the company is subject to warranty or other claims by the company s clients related to product failures caused by the year problem
