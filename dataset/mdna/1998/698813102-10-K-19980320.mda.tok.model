at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and  franchised restaurants 
the company s revenues are principally derived from retail sales of pizza to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights  and sales to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  and information systems and related services used in their operations 
the company intends to continue to expand the number of company owned and franchised restaurants 
the company s expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling the company to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
the company believes that its expansion strategy has contributed to increases in comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants of in  in and in the company anticipates that future comparable sales increases  if any  will be at a lesser rate than in recent years 
average sales for company owned restaurants open a full year increased to  for from  for this increase is attributable to continuing strong sales of maturing restaurants and to the fact that several new markets were entered in and  with generally lower sales volumes throughout as those markets were built out 
average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which the company has established a significant market position  although recent trends indicate that new markets are opening with stronger than historical sales volumes 
approximately of the company s revenues for and for were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items and information systems equipment and software and related services by the company  its commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc  and the company s support services subsidiary  printing promotions  inc the company believes that  in addition to supporting both company and franchised growth  these subsidiaries contribute to product quality and consistency throughout the papa john s system 
the company continually strives to obtain high quality sites with greater access and visibility  and to enhance the appearance and quality of its restaurants 
the company believes that these factors improve papa john s image and brand awareness 
during and  the company pursued a greater number of free standing conversion and prototype locations and expects to continue this strategy in over time  the company expects that these free standing units will approximate of the total company owned restaurants 
the average cash investment for the company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land and pre opening costs  increased to approximately  from  for the units opened in this increase was primarily due to the planned increase in the percentage of higher cost free standing units opened during the company expects the average cash investment for restaurants opening in to approximate  as the company plans to build a number of free standing units in comparable to pre opening costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over a period of one year from the opening date of the restaurant or commissary facility 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities the sop which  if finalized  would require adoption at the beginning of the company s initial application of the sop would require the write off of deferred pre opening costs as of the date of adoption  and such write off would be reported  on a net of tax basis  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company does not expect the adoption of the sop to significantly impact future operating income due to the relative consistency of new facility openings and length of the current amortization period 
deferred pre opening costs as of december  were million 
the company defers certain costs incurred in connection with the development of its information systems and amortizes such costs over periods of up to five years from the date of completion
