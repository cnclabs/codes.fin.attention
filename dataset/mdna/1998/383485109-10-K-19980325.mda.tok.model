liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
as described more fully below  the company s working capital requirements are currently met through a combination of cash provided by operations  short term trade credit  and by borrowings under its revolving line of credit and its receivables securitization program 
revolving line of credit and working capital facility 
the company has a revolving line of credit arrangement with congress which provides the company with an million working capital facility through march  borrowings under the arrangement are limited to a restrictive borrowing base equal to of eligible merchandise inventories  increasing to of such inventories during the period of september through december of each year to fund increased seasonal inventory requirements 
interest under the facility is charged at a rate of approximately libor plus at january   with no interest charged on the unused portion of the line of credit 
for fiscal  the interest rate applicable to the line of credit has been reduced by to approximately libor plus 
the maximum amount available for borrowings under the line of credit with congress was million as of january   of which million was outstanding as of that date 
of that amount  million has been classified as long term in the accompanying financial statements as the company does not anticipate repaying that amount prior to one year from the balance sheet date 
the agreement contains one financial covenant  pertaining to the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth  with which the company was in compliance as of january  in addition to the congress facility  the company also has up to million of additional working capital financing available under the variable base certificate  issued to bank hapoalim 
the company can borrow against the variable base certificate on a revolving basis  similar to a line of credit arrangement 
borrowings against the variable base certificate are limited to a percentage of the outstanding balance of receivables underlying the certificate  and therefore  the company s borrowing capacity under the facility is subject to seasonal variations that may affect the outstanding balance of such receivables 
interest on outstanding borrowings on the facility is charged at a rate of approximately libor plus at january  
at january   million was outstanding under the line of credit with bank hapoalim  which was the maximum amount available for borrowings as of that date 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 effective fiscal  borrowings against the variable base certificate are treated as off balance sheet borrowings for financial reporting purposes and are excluded from amounts reported in the accompanying fiscal financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal  transfers of receivables underlying the variable base certificate were accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes 
accordingly  outstanding borrowings against the variable base certificate as of february   totaling  are included in amounts reported in the company s fiscal financial statements 
as described more fully in the cash flows from securitization program portion of this section  the issuance of an additional million fixed base certificate in fiscal reduced the level of receivables allocable to the variable base certificate  and thus has reduced the company s borrowing capacity under the facility 
other financings 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has four fifteen year mortgage loans with midland commercial funding midland with outstanding balances totaling million at january  the midland loans  due  bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the company also has the following other long term loan facilities as of january  i a mortgage loan payable with heller financial  inc heller due  with an outstanding loan balance of million  an additional mortgage loan payable with heller  due march  with an outstanding loan balance of million  iii two notes payable to federated department stores  inc  due  with outstanding balances totaling million  and iv other long term obligations with outstanding balances totaling million 
certain of the company s long term debt and lease arrangements contain various restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such restrictive covenants as of january  cash flows from securitization program 
the company s receivables securitization program provides the company with an additional source of working capital financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
accordingly  the company continually seeks to divert as large a percentage of total borrowings as possible to its securitization program 
since  the company has issued million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificates the fixed base certificates and a million principal amount fixed base certificate the fixed base certificate under the program 
proceeds from the issuances of the and fixed base certificates collectively  the fixed base certificates were used to reduce or repay previously outstanding higher interest bearing debt obligations of the company and pay certain costs associated with the transaction 
interest is earned by the certificateholders on a monthly basis and is paid through finance charges collected under the program 
the outstanding principal balance of the certificates are to be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing september through september  through the application of credit card receivable principal collections during that period 
management currently intends to refinance the fixed base certificates as they mature with newly issued certificates under the program 
the issuances of the fixed base certificates were accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the million of receivables underlying those certificates and the corresponding debt obligations have been excluded from the accompanying financial statements 
the company also issued a variable base class a credit card certificate variable base certificate in in the principal amount of up to million to bank hapoalim 
the company can borrow against the variable base certificate on a revolving basis  similar to a revolving line of credit arrangement 
management also intends to refinance the variable base certificate upon its maturity in september in addition to the fixed and variable base certificates  additional series of certificates may be issued as a source of additional working capital financing to the company 
however  other than refinancing the previously issued certificates upon their maturity  management does not currently anticipate any additional certificate issuances in fiscal management believes the previously described sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal management also believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity for its long term growth plans at moderate levels 
the company may engage in other financing activities if it is deemed to be advantageous 
additional cash flow and working capital analysis 
working capital decreased by million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to as of the end of fiscal as compared to as of the end of fiscal this decrease is primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long term obligations related to new financing arrangements entered into or finalized in fiscal  in addition to an increase in trade payables and the related cash management liability resulting from the timing of the payment for  and the clearing of  certain payables at year end 
cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash income and expense items  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  the provision for uncollectible accounts and changes in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the additional investment in merchandise inventories required for new stores  partially offset by cash received from the return of certain previously outstanding deposits and an increase in amounts due from gcc trust  resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease is also due to additional cash flows received in fiscal resulting from the payment of approximately million of operating expenses related to fiscal during the rd week of fiscal as a result of the fiscal calendar shift  and from the receipt of million in connection with the filing of certain amended income tax returns 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the company spent million more on capital expenditures  net of reimbursements received  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the cash used in fiscal for capital expenditures was partially offset by cash provided under the securitization program of million in fiscal the company s expansion program included the completion and opening of one new department store in sonora  california in august and one new department store in santa rosa  california in september the company also completed the first phase of the  square foot expansion and remodel of its existing store located in the valley plaza mall in bakersfield  california and certain other store remodel projects 
these projects were funded primarily with cash generated by operations  proceeds from previously described long term financing arrangements entered into in late fiscal and with borrowings under the company s working capital facilities 
the company also continued to invest in the enhancement of various management information systems in fiscal the company also opened two new department stores in fiscal cash required to open a particular new store  however  may vary significantly depending upon various factors  including whether the store was fully constructed  the size  age and condition of an existing store location if assumed from another party  and the extent of construction allowances to be received 
capital expenditures in fiscal and were partially offset by reimbursements received from certain of the mall owners  in addition to proceeds from various sale and sale leaseback arrangements entered into during those periods 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal  which requires the presentation of purchases and maturities of securities under the company s securitization program to be presented as investing activities in the statement of cash flows 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in the cash management liability  which resulted from the timing of the payment for  and the clearing of  certain payables at year end  in addition to an increase in cash provided by gcc trust  resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal cash held by gcc trust in fiscal and  classified as financing activities for statement of cash flow purposes  were reflected as a receivable from gcc trust pursuant to sfas no 
in fiscal and classified as an operating activity in the fiscal statement of cash flows 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in net borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and the variable base certificate in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the application of the final million proceeds received from the previously described mortgage loan with heller 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal include proceeds from the fixed base certificate and million received from the previously described heller loan 
such proceeds  however  were more than fully offset by principal payments made on various short term and long term obligations during the year 
the company has entered into an agreement to open one new department store in the second half of fiscal and is in process of remodeling certain existing store locations 
the estimated cost of such projects is million 
such costs are expected to be provided for from existing financial resources and from additional long term financing 
such projects are expected to be fully complete in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that the completion of such projects will not be delayed subject to a variety of conditions precedent or other factors 
proposed acquisition of the harris company 
on july   the company entered into a non binding letter of intent with el corte ingles eci  of spain  and the harris company harris 
the letter of intent contemplated the purchase of all of the common stock of harris  a wholly owned subsidiary of eci  which currently operates nine department stores located throughout southern california 
the two parties were unable to agree on the terms of the transaction and terminated negotiations in october the company incurred non recurring costs totaling  in connection with the proposed acquisition  consisting primarily of investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
year conversion the company has established a task force to coordinate the identification  evaluation and implementation of changes to computer systems and applications necessary to achieve a year date conversion with no disruption to business operations 
these actions are necessary to ensure that the systems and applications will recognize and process the year and beyond 
major areas of potential business impact have been identified and are being dimensioned  and initial conversion efforts are underway 
the company is also communicating with suppliers  dealers  financial institutions and others with which it does business to coordinate the year conversion 
the total cost of the conversion is currently estimated to be  and is not expected to materially affect the company s results of operations during the fiscal conversion period 
such costs are expected to consist primarily of external consulting fees and costs in excess of normal software upgrades and replacements and will be incurred throughout fiscal the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor to the company s operations during the past several years  the company does experience some increases in the cost of certain of its merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company accounts for its merchandise inventories on the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost using the department store price indexes published by the bureau of labor statistics 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation in reported income due to increasing costs 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating results realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels
