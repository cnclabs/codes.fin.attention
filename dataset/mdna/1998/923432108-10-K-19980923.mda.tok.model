item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this md a contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth herein  including those set forth in factors affecting future results below 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest june fiscal years   and ended june  june  and june  respectively  and consisted of weeks 
references to   and shall be to the respective fiscal year unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires 
overview verilink corporation the company develops  manufactures and markets integrated access products for telecommunications network service providers nsps and corporate end users 
verilink s integrated network access products are used by network service providers such as interexchange and local exchange carriers  and providers of internet  personal communications and cellular services to provide seamless connectivity and interconnect for multiple traffic types on wide area networks wans 
during  verilink s access system product line continued to generate the majority of sales 
verilink designed the access system with modular hardware and software to enable its customers to access increased network capacity and to adopt new communications services in a cost effective manner 
the access system provides integrated access to low speed services  fractional t e services  and t  e  t  and frame relay services 
the access system product currently under development  is expected to include an increase in switching capacity  support for voice signals and broadband multiplexing up to t rates 
the company has other features under development that are intended to expand the number of services the access system products support 
the company also sells single purpose network access devices for selected applications 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
results of operations sales thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for of million represented a decrease of approximately from net sales of million 
net sales for increased approximately over net sales of million 
the decline in net sales during was attributable primarily to a decline in shipments to the company s reseller and carrier customers partially off set by improved shipments to system integrators 
the company believes net sales were adversely affected in part by pending merger and consolidation discussions among the company s key customers resulting in delayed purchases 
during  shipments of the access system product line in total accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during and in  while shipments of the company s legacy products csu s and liu s have continued to decline 
the increase in net sales over net sales was primarily due to the increase in unit shipments as a result of market acceptance of the company s access system product line 
the company s business is characterized by the concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in   and  respectively 
the company s largest customers in fiscal were nortel  mci  qualcomm  compuserve and ameritech 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  system integrators  value added resellers vars and distributors 
sales to vars and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in as compared to approximately in and in to date  sales outside of north america have not been significant 
the company intends to expand the marketing of its products  particularly to markets outside of north america 
gross profit thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit as a percentage of sales in was as compared to in and in the decrease in gross profit margin in was primarily due to increased manufacturing overhead spending resulting from higher labor and facility related costs at lower net sales levels 
the increase in manufacturing overhead spending is offset in part by favorable direct material costs 
the decrease in gross profit margin in from was primarily the result of higher fixed overhead costs associated with the addition of a new manufacturing facility and lower sales volume during the second half of in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs  and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development expenses r d increased to million or of sales in  compared to million and million or and of sales for and  respectively 
the expense increase during is due principally to the use of outside consultants and the addition of personnel associated with product development activities 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of sales is due to an increase in spending at reduced sales levels 
during  the company s new product development efforts focused on advanced features for the access system platform  the access system the company s next generation integrated access platform and development of the node manager developed to provide node element management capabilities for all access system and modules 
the increase in r d expenses during was due principally to the addition of personnel  use of outside consultants  depreciation of capital expenditures and prototype development  design and testing 
the company considers product development expenditures to be critical to future sales and expects to increase spending in absolute dollars  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
selling  general and administrative thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in dollars spent in was due to the increase in selling and marketing activities and personnel related costs necessary to support the company s infrastructure 
these expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in due to increased dollar spending between periods at reduced net sales levels 
the company expects to increase sales and marketing spending in fiscal as a part of its effort to increase and expand the markets for its new and existing products 
in addition  the company expects to increase administrative and information technology costs necessary to support expanded operations 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses may over time vary as a percentage of sales 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net remained relatively unchanged between and at approximately million compared to  in the increase in interest income during is due primarily to the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering of its common stock  completed in june provision for benefit from income taxes during  the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of  representing an effective tax rate of 
this benefit reflects available net operating loss carryback capacity 
the provision for income taxes for was million  an effective tax rate of  compared to an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate of approximates the combined federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate in was less than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of previously reserved deferred tax assets based on carryback capacity 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  an increase of approximately million from the june  balance of million 
during  the company generated million of net cash from operating activities  a million increase over the million generated in and a million increase over the million generated during accounts receivable was approximately million lower at june   when compared to june   reflecting an improvement in the linearity of shipments during the fourth quarter of accounts receivable remained constant in as compared to at million 
inventory levels increased approximately  from reflecting product staging necessary to meet anticipated future product shipment requirements 
inventory levels declined approximately  in when compared to balances 
in  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  reflecting increased procurement activities and accruals for outside consultants and service providers 
net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase over and in cash used for net investing activities is primarily the result of greater purchases of short term investments 
during  verilink invested approximately million in information technology tools and an enterprise resource planning erp software application and approximately  in engineering development and test tools 
in  the company invested million in property  and equipment compared to million in the investments in property and equipment were primarily for computer and test equipment and leasehold improvements for its new  square foot manufacturing facility 
the company estimates that total budgeted capital expenditures for will approximate million and will include expenditures for test equipment  design tools  and implementation of a new erp software application 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided from financing activities was  in compared to million in and million in in  the company had a secured million revolving line of credit which expired on august  there was no borrowing under the line of credit in or in june the company raised million through its initial public offering of common stock 
prior to the offering  the primary source of financing for the company had been cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its cash and investment balances and anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate to finance current operations  anticipated investments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company continues to investigate the possibility of generating financial resources through committed credit agreements  technology or manufacturing partnerships  equipment financing  and offerings of debt and equity securities 
factors affecting future results as described by the following factors  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the statements contained in this annual report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s beliefs  expectations  hopes  plans and goals regarding the future 
actual results could differ from those projected in any forward looking statements for the reasons detailed below and in the other sections of this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report on form k  and the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
you should consult the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k and the company s annual report to stockholders 
customer concentration 
a small number of customers have accounted for a majority of the company s sales in each of the past several fiscal years 
in fiscal  nortel  mci  qualcomm and compuserve accounted for   and of the company s sales  respectively  and sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  nortel  mci  qualcomm and compuserve accounted for   and of the company s sales  respectively  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  mci and compuserve accounted for and of the company s sales  respectively and the company s top five customers accounted for of sales 
other than nortel  mci  qualcomm and compuserve  no customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in fiscal years   or there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
certain customers of the company have been or may be acquired by other existing customers 
the impact of such acquisitions on sales to such customers is uncertain  but there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will not result in a reduction in sales to those customers 
in addition  such acquisitions could result in further concentration of the company s customers 
the company has in the past experienced significant declines in sales it believes were in part related to orders being delayed or cancelled as a result of pending acquisitions relating to its customers 
there can be no assurance future merger and acquisition activity among the customers will not have a similar or worse adverse affect on the company s sales and results of operations 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see competition and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to mci  nortel  qualcomm and compuserve have varied between quarters by as much as million and have been the major contributor to the variability of quarterly sales in most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by other vendors of components in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
operating results in recent periods have been adversely affected by delays in receipt of significant purchase orders from customers 
the company believes that recent period sales have been adversely impacted by budgetary constraints caused by pending merger discussions at some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  and therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company  its major customers or its competitors  delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
the company s products are covered by warranties and the company is subject to contractual commitments 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see year compliance 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume since its initial public offering in june there is no assurance that such fluctuations will not continue 
dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for both the company s access system and the access system product lines 
the access system product line represented approximately of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal market acceptance of both the company s current and future product lines is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement  testing or further refinement before the company can make them commercially available 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
although the company does not believe that such delays have had a material adverse effect on its customer relationships  such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
need to expand sales and marketing organizations and channels of distribution 
currently the company sells its products to a small number of customers through a relatively small sales force 
the company s strategy is to distribute and market its products to a broader customer base  which will require the company to significantly expand its sales force and other channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  train  motivate and manage additional qualified sales and marketing personnel with the requisite experience and knowledge  or attract additional qualified distributors 
availability of qualified sales and product marketing personnel is limited  and competition for experienced personnel in the network access and telecommunications equipment industries is intense 
the failure to timely expand the company s sales force  expand its channels of distribution and product marketing organization could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration  management of growth and dependence on key personnel 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
the company depends in part upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company obtains several components and licenses certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company s requirements for any such components 
the company generally does not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has no current plans to significantly expand its supplier base 
see year compliance 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to determine its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments  and new entrants 
the market for integrated access devices such as the company s access system product line is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of new product features  price and performance  support for multiple types of communications services  network management  reliability  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products and future products under development will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition to date for its current access system products has been from digital link corporation  kentrox  a division of adc telecommunications and larscom  inc  a subsidiary of axel johnson 
in addition  the company expects substantial competition from companies in the computer networking market and other related markets such as newbridge networks corporation  telco systems  inc  visual networks inc  and adtran  inc 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for basic network termination products is mature and that the principal competitive factors in this market are price  installed base and quality of customer support 
in this market  the company primarily competes with adtran  digital link  kentrox  paradyne and larscom 
there can be no assurance that such companies or other competitors will not introduce new products that provide greater functionality and or at a lower price than the company s like products 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging which represent both new market opportunities as well as a threat to current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors into other equipment such as routers and switches  which include direct wan interfaces in certain products  eroding the addressable market for separate network termination products 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products which meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
year compliance 
the year problem is widespread and complex 
if computer  information or telecommunication systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is evaluating its year risk as it exists in four areas information technology infrastructure  including reviewing what actions are necessary to bring all software tools used internally to year compliance  information systems used by the company s suppliers  potential warranty and year claims from the company s customers  and the potential impact of reduced spending by customers or potential customers on telecommunication network solutions as a result of devoting a substantial portion of their information system spending to resolve year compliance issues 
the company is in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure for year compliance  which include reviewing what actions are required to make all software systems used internally year compliant 
the company has purchased an enterprise resource planning erp solution which has been determined to be year compliant 
the implementation of this erp solution will require a material investment by the company in internal and external resources 
significant delays by the company in implementing this erp solution could have a material adverse impact on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
it is the company s intent for all software systems and tools that are identified as non compliant to be either upgraded or replaced 
for the non compliant systems identified to date  the cost to bring the systems to year compliance is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
however  if implementation of replacement systems and tools is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations  business and financial condition could be materially affected 
the company is in the process of contacting its key suppliers to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
in the event that any of the company s key suppliers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
all of the company s products are currently being reviewed for compliance to year guidelines 
this process includes complete and thorough testing of current products as well as inclusion of year requirements in specifications for future product releases 
based on a preliminary review  the company believes its current product shipments are year compliant and that neither performance nor functionality are affected by dates prior to  during  and after the year and that the year is recognized as a leap year 
however  as all customer events cannot be anticipated  the company may see an increase in product warranty and other claims 
in the event that any of the company s products ultimately are not year compliant  or there are customer claims made against the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company has not developed a contingency plan to address every potential year non compliance situation that may be present when the year changes to however  it is the company s intention to formulate contingency plans in those areas where year non compliance could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced and may continue to experience growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operations 
in particular  the company intends to increase its sales  engineering and product marketing organizations 
these increases will result in increased responsibilities for management 
to manage potential future growth effectively  the company must improve its operational  financial and management information systems and must hire  train  motivate and manage a growing number of employees 
the future success of the company also will depend on its ability to increase its customer support capability and to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
in particular  the current availability of qualified personnel is quite limited  and competition among companies for such personnel is intense 
the company is currently attempting to hire a number of sales  product marketing and engineering personnel and has experienced delays in filling such positions and expects to experience continued difficulty in filling its needs for qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively achieve or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could delay product development and introduction cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see need to expand sales and marketing organizations and channels of distribution and dependence on key personnel 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
an important element of the company s strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would compliment its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurrence of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services and atm are still evolving 
as these standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in europe and far east markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company has received and may receive in the future communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities  generally without limitation  resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties
