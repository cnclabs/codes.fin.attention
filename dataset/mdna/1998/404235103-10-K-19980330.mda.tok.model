the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test the systems for the year compliance 
it is anticipated that the project will be completed by early of management does not believe the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings will be material 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
