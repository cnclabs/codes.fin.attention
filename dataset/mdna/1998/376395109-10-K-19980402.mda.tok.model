in connection with the acquisition  the company developed a detailed integration plan  which included the removal of approximately aqua vend machines from service  the upgrading and modification of the majority of the remaining aqua vend machines and the rationalization and relocation of aqua vend machines within glacier s network of machines 
the revenues and operating costs associated with these machines from march  are included in the company s results of operations

the increase in revenues in  however  did not keep pace with the increase in the number of machines in operation since december  due primarily to cooler than usual weather in california in the third quarter  and unusually cold and rainy weather caused by the el nino weather conditions in the fourth quarter 
because california is the company s largest and most important market the softer third and fourth quarter revenues had a significant impact on the company s revenues overall 
costs and expenses operating expenses for fiscal year increased to  or of revenues  compared to  or of revenues in  and  or of revenues in the total dollar increases in both years are due to the additional commissions and service costs associated with the additional machines on location 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in is primarily the result of softer revenues during the third and fourth quarters 
the increase is also due in part to inefficiencies in servicing and other short term increases in service costs experienced as the company focused its efforts on completing the integration of aqua vend

the actual total cost incurred in connection with the completion of these activities in was  interest expense for fiscal year increased to  compared to  in and  in the increases are due to the higher outstanding balances on the company s bank line of credit during each year 
in  the acquisition of aqua vend and the company s investment in new machines were financed through additional borrowing on the line of credit 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal year was  compared to effective rates of in and in the lower effective tax rates in and resulted from the company s realization of the effect of certain income tax credits
