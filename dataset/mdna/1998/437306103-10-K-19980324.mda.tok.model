adoption of these statements will not impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  and any effect will be limited to the form and content of its disclosures 
both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which enables the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
these short term leases minimize the potential adverse effect of inflation on rental income  although residents may leave without penalty at the end of their lease terms and may do so if rents are increased significantly
