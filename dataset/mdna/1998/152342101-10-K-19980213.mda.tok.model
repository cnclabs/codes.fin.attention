the company has accumulated certain tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards which are assets in the sense that they may provide the company with future cash flows from the reduction in future tax payments 
however  the realization of such assets is not assured as it depends upon future taxable income 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the company is required to recognize all or a portion of net deferred tax assets with corresponding increases to net income  when the company believes  given the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other credits will be realized 
centocor has approximately million of deferred tax assets consisting primarily of the future tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards 
the company presently has not concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize all  or a portion of the benefit of such tax assets 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against the asset 
if the company determines that all or a part of these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized through sufficient future profitability based on the outcome of certain future events  then the company will reverse all or part of such valuation allowance and recognize a tax benefit 
until such tax benefit is recognized  the company s effective tax rate is reflective of the utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis and therefore such rate is expected to be substantially lower than the statutory rate 
should all such deferred tax assets be recognized  the company expects that its effective tax rate in future periods will approximate the applicable statutory rates 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets under sfas has no impact on the company s cash flows for income taxes despite the change in the company s effective tax rate 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets will impact reported eps due to the benefit recorded to the statement of operations from the reduction in the company s valuation allowance

year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in many existing computer systems as the millennium approaches 
the year problem is pervasive  virtually every computer operation may be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the risk is that computer systems will not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous date or cause a system to fail  resulting in business interruption 
the year issue is expected to affect the systems of various entities with which the company interacts  including the company s marketing partners  suppliers  and various vendors  and the company is coordinating its efforts to address the year issue with those entities 
however  there can be no assurances that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversation that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its own computer systems  the company is upgrading  generally  in order to meet the demands of its expanding business 
in the process the company is taking steps to identify  correct or reprogram and test its existing systems for year compliance 
it is anticipated that all new system upgrades or reprogramming efforts will be completed by mid  allowing adequate time for testing 
the company presently believes that with modification to existing software and conversations to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  given the complexity of the year issue  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to address the problem without costs and uncertainties that might affect future financial results or cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
since the company currently plans to upgrade the majority of its systems regardless of the year problem  management has not separately assessed the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings 
the mid date by which the company plans to complete its upgrades and year modifications is management s best estimate  which was derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurances that this estimate will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
inflation the company believes the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on its operations or financial condition
