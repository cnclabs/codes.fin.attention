item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal net sales cost of goods sold  occupancy and buying expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses depreciation and leasehold amortization amortization of cost in excess of net assets of acquired businesses restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges expenses related to acquisitions earnings loss from continuing operations before interest  income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change interest expense earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes earnings loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits estimated loss from disposal of discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit net income loss pro forma adjustment for income taxes pro forma net income loss amounts for  and have been reclassified from amounts originally reported to segregate the effects of eyex  the company s optical segment  which was recorded as a discontinued operation in fiscal  from continuing operations 
overview during fiscal  the company s operations continued to be negatively affected by a slowdown in comparable store sales  and certain international and licensed department operations continued to perform below expectations 
in response to these performance levels  management performed an assessment of the company s asset base  and determined that approximately marginal or unprofitable locations should be closed  asset impairments should be recognized with respect to certain international and licensed department locations  certain store locations and other fixed assets  merchandise assortments should be focused and the company s vendor base should be reduced  and the company s eyex segment should be discontinued 
the evaluation of the company s asset base  the related decision to reduce vendor and total unit presentation  the adoption of two new accounting principles and other responses to the current sunglass specialty environment resulted in million of costs million net of tax  or per share  during the fourth quarter of fiscal as follows million of long lived and intangible asset impairments recognized in the company s international operations  licensed department operations  selected store locations  as well as certain other fixed assets  million of costs write off of fixed assets  lease exit and other incremental exit costs related to the elimination of approximately marginal or unprofitable sites through closure  million of costs associated with the discontinuation and disposal of the company s eyex optical segment  million of inventory disposition costs in connection with the company s decision to improve merchandise clarity and focus through the reduction of its vendor and total unit presentation  million of costs related to the impact of the adoption of new accounting principles during fiscal related to internal use software  including the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to costs incurred in connection with the company s information technology transformation projects  and million of other costs and expenses attributable to  among other things  efforts to restructure the company s organizational infrastructure including management retention and severance costs associated with the reorganization of international operations and other items 
the net cash impact of these actions in is expected to be positive  as cash restructuring costs will likely be more than offset by income tax savings and inventory reduction associated with store closings 
also  it is estimated that annual pre tax earnings could improve by up to million once these restructuring actions are fully completed by fiscal  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the fiscal charges discussed above are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as follows fiscal in thousands inventory disposition costs reflected in cost of goods sold  occupancy and buying expenses  costs attributable to restructuring of organizational infrastructure reflected in cost of goods sold  occupancy and buying expenses  reflected in operating expenses  restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges impairment of long lived and intangible assets  restructuring costs  discontinuation of eyex segment  net of tax  costs related to the impact of adoption of new accounting principles costs attributable to adoption of new accounting principle for internal use software reflected in operating expenses  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for costs incurred in information technology transformation projects  net of tax  total charges  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal comparable store sales for fiscal were flat

the company s effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the variation in the effective rate from the statutory rate for the tax benefit in fiscal and the tax provision in is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance for certain international deferred tax assets

comparable store sales increased in fiscal from fiscal throughout fiscal  sales performance in both comparable and new stores progressively weakened 
management attributes this weakness to a variety of factors  including unfavorable weather conditions as compared to the prior year  lack of timely new product introductions and increased turnover of store level associates particularly as a result of acquisitions completed in fiscal 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased by to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to the company s new store expansion  including expansion into international markets  and higher inventory shrinkage and changes in manufacturers return policies which resulted in defective product write offs

the company reported a total net loss of  in fiscal compared to pro forma net income of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support its inventory requirements and new store additions  and cash needs for its restructuring plan  as well as for the potential repurchase of stock  as authorized by the company s board of directors in march the company s long term liquidity requirements relate principally to the maturity of the new revolving credit facility in april  the maturity of the million convertible subordinated notes in june  operating lease commitments and continued store expansion 
in april  the company entered into an million revolving credit facility with bankboston retail finance inc bankboston  which replaced its former revolving credit agreement 
bankboston s commitment to fund revolving credit borrowings will reduce to million effective february  the credit facility includes up to million in letters of credit 
borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at the company s option  a the prime rate or b libor plus 
the facility is secured with a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all assets 
borrowings under the bankboston facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases subject to minimum remaining borrowing availability of million 
due to the seasonal nature of the company s business  outstanding borrowings typically peak during the first and third fiscal quarters as the company finances inventory purchases in advance of the company s highest sales periods 
see seasonality and quarterly results 
at january   the company had outstanding borrowings under its former credit facility of million and million in letters of credit outstanding  which were maintained as security for performance under the company s executive office lease and for purchases of certain merchandise 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the difference between the company s net loss and operating cash flow in fiscal is primarily attributable to the reduction in inventory of million including a provision of million to reduce discontinued merchandise to its net realizable value as a result of management s decision to focus the company s merchandise assortment  the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and the provision for restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges of million  offset by an increase in other current assets for tax refunds receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the fiscal and cash flows reflect capital expenditures for new stores as well as expenditures for renovation of existing stores 
the decrease in capital expenditures is due to a lower number of new store openings

at january   the company s commitments for capital expenditures totaled million and related primarily to capital costs for new store construction and existing store renovations 
management believes that net cash provided by operations together with borrowing availability under the company s new credit facility will be sufficient to fund estimated capital expenditures associated with the company s planned opening of approximately to sunglass hut and watch station locations in fiscal  potential stock repurchases under the company s common stock repurchase program  planned cash expenditures associated with the company s restructuring plan and other working capital requirements through at least fiscal seasonality and quarterly results historically  the company s operations have been seasonal  with highest net sales and net income occurring in the second fiscal quarter reflecting increased demand for sunglasses during the spring and summer months and  to a lesser extent  the fourth fiscal quarter reflecting increased demand during the yearend holiday selling season 
the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores  the integration of new stores into the operations of the company and the timing of planned store closures  as well as other factors 
the addition of a large number of new stores can affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis
