summary of deposits deposits are currently the bank s sole source of funds 
the bank can obtain additional funds when needed to meet occasional declines in deposits or other short term liquidity needs  through the overnight purchase of federal funds 
however  the bank does not currently use these sources of funds 
generally  the bank has funds in excess of the needs for its deposit withdrawals or short term liquidity needs and it  therefore  sells federal funds to other financial institutions or invests in short term securities 
the bank s deposits are attracted primarily from individuals and commercial enterprises 
the bank also attracts some deposits from municipalities and other government agencies 
the bank does not have foreign deposits  brokered deposits or variable rate fixed term deposits 
the bank does not expect to obtain future deposits through the use of brokered deposits 
the bank had noninterest bearing demand deposits of million  interest bearing now and money market accounts of million  time deposits for individuals and corporations of million  and savings of million as of december  the company had interest bearing deposits of and of total deposits as of december  and  respectively 
while the bank does not experience material repeated seasonal fluctuations in deposit levels  the bank s relative growth in deposits and loans may be affected by seasonal and economic changes  which  in turn  may impact liquidity 
the bank does not have any brokered deposits 
the bank has a deposit concentration from five customers of  as of december  management believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet loan commitments and deposit demands 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s average balances of deposits  as a percentage of average total deposits and average interest paid by category for the years ended december mmda total demand and now savings time deposits dollars in thousands average balance      percent of total average interest rate paid average balance      percent of total average interest rate paid average balance      percent of total average interest rate paid the following table indicates the amount and maturity of the bank s time certificates of deposit over  as of december  balance percent of total dollars in thousands less than three months  three months through six months  six months through twelve months over twelve months return on equity and assets the following table indicates the key financial ratios of the bank for the years ended december profitability ratios rate of return on average total assets rate of return on average stockholders equity capital ratios cash dividend payment ratio to net earnings average stockholders equity to average total assets competition the banking business in southern california and the market areas served by the bank are highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits and are dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area 
the bank is one of several locally owned independent banks located in the bank s primary service area 
the bank also competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks  including many which are much larger than the bank  as well as with savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  brokerage houses and other financial institutions 
larger commercial banks offer certain services such as trust and investment services which the bank does not offer directly but some of which it offers indirectly through correspondent institutions 
such banks also have substantially higher lending limits than the bank has or will have due to their larger capital base 
in addition  recently enacted legislation will increase the competition the bank faces from savings and loan associations  and credit unions for the deposit and loan business of individuals 
the growth of money market funds and quasi financial institutions  such as certain activities of retailers and other which are not subject to the same regulatory controls  also presents a source of competition for the bank 
with the decline in interest rates  depositors have been seeking alternative investments to earn higher yields than the bank is currently paying 
in order to compete with the other financial institutions in its primary service area  the bank relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal contact by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours  and specialized services 
for customers whose loan demands exceed the bank s lending limit  the bank has attempted and will continue in the future to attempt to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other banks 
the bank also assists customers requiring other services not offered by the bank in obtaining such services from its correspondent banks 
supervision and regulation the company is subject to the regulation of the federal reserve bank holding company act of  as amended  and the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
the bank is subject to the regulation of the fdic and the occ 
among other regulations  the occ establishes minimum capital requirements  which the bank exceeds as of december  during  congress passed the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  which focused primarily on tightening the supervision of banks and thrifts and recapitalizing the bank insurance fund bif 
among other things  fdicia requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to inadequately capitalized banks 
fdicia established five tiers of capital management ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
if a bank does not meet any of the minimum capital requirements set by its regulators  fdicia requires certain responses  such as that the bank submit a plan  guaranteed by its holding company  to restore its capital to adequate levels 
the company has a policy to maintain capital ratios above the well capitalized levels 
as deposits of the bank are insured by the bif as administered by the fdic  the bank is subject to fdic insurance assessments 
for purposes of determining insurance premium assessments  the fdic places each insured bank in one of nine risk categories base on its level of capital and other relevant information such as supervisory evaluations 
assessment rates for deposit premiums currently range from zero to percent  depending on the assessment category into which the insured institution is placed 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major changes and the impact such changes might have on the bancorp and the bank is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes  which have been enacted recently by congress and others  which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory or professional agencies are discussed below 
in august  governor wilson of california signed assembly bill ab which provides for certain changes in the banking laws of california 
effective january  ab eliminates the provisions regarding impairment of contributed capital and the assessment of shares when there is an impairment of capital 
ab now allows the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions the commissioner to close a bank  if the commissioner finds that the bank s tangible shareholders equity is less than the greater of of the bank s total assets or million 
ab also moved administration of the local agency program from the california department of financial institutions to the california state treasurer s office

regulatory agencies may not examine for fcra compliance unless there is a consumer complaint investigation that reveals a violation or where the agency otherwise finds a violation 
in the area of the equal credit opportunity act  banks that self test for compliance with fair lending laws will be protected from the results of the test provided that appropriate corrective action is taken when violations are found 
on september   assembly bill known as the caldera  weggeland  and killea california interstate banking and branching act of and referred to herein as cibba was enacted which allows for early interstate branching in california 
under the federally enacted riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of ibbea  discussed in more detail below  individual states could opt out of the federal law that would allow banks on an interstate basis to engage in interstate branching by merging out of state banks with host state banks after june  in addition under ibbea  individual states could also opt in and allow out of state banks to merge with host state banks prior to june  the host state is allowed under ibbea to impose certain nondiscriminatory conditions on the resulting depository institution until june  california  in enacting cibba  authorizes out of state banks to enter california by the acquisition of or merger with a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years 
section of the california financial code section as added by cibba provides for the election of california to opt in under ibbea allowing interstate bank merger transactions prior to july  of an out of state bank with a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years 
the early opt in has the reciprocal effect of allowing california banks to merge with out of state banks where the states of such out of state banks have also opted in under ibbea 
the five year age limitation is not required when the california bank is in danger of failing or in certain other emergency situations 
under ibbea  california may also allow interstate branching through the acquisition of a branch in california without the acquisition of an entire california bank 
section provides an express prohibition against interstate branching through the acquisition of a branch in california without the acquisition of the entire california bank 
ibbea also has a provision allowing states to opt in with respect to permitting interstate branching through the establishment of de novo or new branches by out of state banks 
section provides that california expressly prohibits interstate branching through the establishment of de novo branches of out of state banks in california  or in other words  california did not opt in this aspect of ibbea 
cibba also amends the california financial code to include agency provisions to allow california banks to establish affiliated insured depository institution agencies out of state as allowed under ibbea 
other provisions of cibba amend the intrastate branching laws  govern the use of shared atm s  and amend intrastate branch acquisition and bank merger laws 
another banking bill enacted in california in was senate bill known as the state bank parity act and is referred to herein as the sbpa 
sbpa went into effect on january   and its purpose is to allow a california state bank to be on a level playing field with a national bank by the elimination of certain disparities and allowing the commissioner authority to implement certain changes in california banking law which are parallel to changes in national banking law such as closer conformance of california s version of regulation o to the frb s version of regulation o and certain other changes including allowing the repurchase of stock with the prior written consent of the commissioner 
on september   ibbea was enacted which has eliminated many of the current restrictions to interstate banking and branching 
ibbea permits full nationwide interstate banking to adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies beginning september  without regard to whether such transaction is expressly prohibited under the laws of any state 
ibbea s branching provisions permit full nationwide interstate bank merger transactions to adequately capitalized and adequately managed banks beginning june  however  states retain the right to completely opt out of interstate bank mergers and to continue to require that out of state banks comply with the states rules governing entry 
the states that opt out must enact a law after september  and before june  that i applies equally to all out of state banks  and ii expressly prohibits merger transactions with out of state banks 
states  which opt out of allowing interstate bank merger transactions  will preclude the mergers of banks in the opting out state with banks located in other states 
in addition  banks located in states that opt out are not permitted to have interstate branches 
states can also opt in which means states can permit interstate branching earlier than june  the laws governing interstate banking and interstate bank mergers provide that transactions  which result in the bank holding company or bank controlling or holding in excess of ten percent of the total deposits nationwide or thirty percent of the total deposits statewide  will not be permitted except under certain specified conditions 
however  any state may waive the thirty percent provision for such state 
in addition  a state may impose a cap of less than thirty percent of the total amount of deposits held by a bank holding company or bank provided such cap is not discriminatory to out of state bank holding companies or banks 
on september   the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of the act was enacted which covers a wide range of topics including small business and commercial real estate loan securitization  money laundering  flood insurance  consumer home equity loan disclosure and protection as well as the funding of community development projects and regulatory relief 
the major items of regulatory relief contained in the act include an examination schedule that has been eased for the top rated banks and will be every months for camel banks with less than million in total assets and camel banks with less than million in total assets the million amount was amended to million by the act discussed above 
the act amends federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of with respect to the section  the mandate to the federal banking agencies to issue safety and soundness regulations  including regulations concerning executive compensation allowing the federal banking regulatory agencies to issue guidelines instead of regulations 
further regulatory relief is provided in the act  as each of the federal regulatory banking agencies  including the national credit union administration board  is required to establish an internal regulatory appeals process for insured depository institutions within months 
in addition  the department of justice day waiting period for mergers and acquisitions is reduced by the act to days for certain acquisitions and mergers 
in the area of currency transaction reports  the act requires the secretary of the treasury to allow financial institutions to file such reports electronically 
the act also requires the secretary of the treasury to publish written rulings concerning the bank secrecy act  and staff commentary on bank secrecy act regulations must also be published on an annual basis 
the procedures for forming a bank holding company have also been simplified 
the formal application process for many holding company formations is now a simplified day notice procedure 
in addition  the securities act of has been amended by the act to further simplify the securities issuance in connection with a bank holding company formation 
on december   the resolution trust corporation completion act the rtcca was enacted 
the rtcca provides additional funding for failed savings associations under the jurisdiction of the resolution trust corporation 
in addition to providing such funding  the rtcca  among other things  makes it more difficult for the federal banking agencies to obtain prejudgment injunctive relief against depository institutions and parties affiliated with such institutions  extends the moratorium on depository institutions converting from saif insurance to bif insurance or vice versa  and prohibits the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic from using any deposit insurance funds to benefit the shareholders of a failed or failing depository institution 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of the budget act  which was signed into law on august   contains numerous tax and other provisions which may affect financial institutions and their businesses 
the budget act contains a provision that establishes a priority for depositors  or the fdic as subrogee thereof  in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution for which a receiver is appointed after august  in addition  under the existing cross guarantee provisions of federal banking law  the fdic has the power to estimate the cost of the failure of an insured depository institution and assess a charge against any financial institution affiliated with the failed institution

the decreased provision in from and reflect a higher quality loan portfolio resulting from an improved local economy in orange county 
the company also experienced increased recoveries in on amounts previously charged off 
these recoveries offset the need for additional provision 
management believes that the current allowance for credit losses is adequate to provide for potential losses in the portfolio 
the current local economic outlook for is promising 
however  assurance cannot be made as to its realization and  accordingly  future provisions for credit losses cannot be estimated at this time 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income was million in  an increase of million or from the million in the increase resulted from increased gains on the sale of sba loans and increased service charges on deposits 
other income in decreased million or from the million in the decrease resulted from a decline in gains on loan sales in as compared to other expenses were million in  an increase of million or from the million in other expenses in decreased million or from the million in the decrease resulted from lower fdic insurance costs and lower other real estate owned expenses

the pretax earnings were million in  an increase of million or from the million in a reduction of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset lowered the fully taxable amount million in the provision for income taxes in decreased million or from the million in the decrease in resulted from lower pretax earnings and a smaller reduction of the company s valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
the deferred tax asset valuation reduction in decreased million from the million in in and  management determined that portions of the valuation allowance were no longer necessary as the deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
accordingly  the provision for income taxes is less than the amount computed at the federal statutory rate in and see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provisions in fasb statement no 
and the effect of alternative minimum tax have the potential for producing  under certain conditions  significant distortions in future income tax provisions and the effective tax rate 
net earnings were million in  an increase million or from the million in the increase in resulted from increased interest income of million and gains on sales of loans of million  and offset by increases in taxes of million 
the decrease in resulted from decreased interest income of million  increase interest expense of million and offset by reductions in other expenses of million 
while management is optimistic about the future  the effects of current economic conditions on the collectibility of loans cannot be predicted with absolute certainty and its effects on future profitability cannot be determined 
off balance sheet analysis the contractual amounts associated with certain financial transactions are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
off balance sheet treatment is generally considered appropriate either where exchange of the underlying asset or liability has not occurred or is not assured  or where contractual amounts are used solely to determine cash flows to be exchanged 
the company s off balance sheet financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
a majority of these commitments are with variable interest rates 
additional information about off balance sheet financial instruments is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity the company uses asset liability management on its balance sheet to minimize the exposure of interest rate movements on its net interest income 
the principal function of asset liability management is to manage the interest rate risk in the balance sheet by maintaining a proper balance  match and mix between rate sensitive interest earning assets and rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
the term rate sensitive refers to those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
when interest rates fluctuate  earnings may be affected in many ways as the interest rates of assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts 
the company minimizes its interest rate risk in the balance sheet by emphasizing the origination of variable interest rate loans that have the ability to reprice overnight and maintaining a high volume of federal funds sold to offset the deposits that may potentially reprice overnight 
a repricing gap is the difference between total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities available for repricing during a given time interval 
a positive repricing gap exists when total interest earning assets exceed total interest bearing liabilities within a repricing period and a negative repricing gap exists when total interest bearing liabilities are in excess of interest earning assets within a repricing period 
generally  a positive repricing gap increases net interest income in a rising rate environment and decreases net interest income in a falling rate environment 
a positive repricing gap may increase net interest income in a falling rate environment depending on the amount of the excess repricing gap and extent of the drop in interest rates 
a negative repricing gap tends to increase net interest income in a falling rate environment and decrease net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the net interest income of the company will benefit from a rising rate environment based on the positive repricing gap 
the following table displays the repricing period for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the related repricing gap as of december  after one due within due within but within after months months five years five years dollars in thousands interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities    repricing gap     cumulative repricing gap     cumulative gap as a percent of earning assets includes collateralized mortgage obligations in the one year to five year maturities based on the average expected lives 
the company had available for sale securities of million recorded at market value as of december  the available for sale securities consist of medium term government agency notes 
the company also had held to maturity securities of million recorded at amortized cost as of december  the held to maturity securities are collateralized mortgage obligations that may be repaid without penalties 
the value of these securities is subject to fluctuation based upon current long term interest rates 
the company had million of interest earning assets and million of interest bearing demand and savings deposits as of december  that are able to reprice overnight 
the estimated effect on net interest income for a decrease from prevailing interest rates over a one year period would be a decline of approximately million 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  the liquidity and the maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
year issue the company is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its computer  including third party vendors  and environmental systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation and monitoring plan to resolve the issue 
the year is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the vendor programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing vendor software and upgrading to new software packages  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
the company also believes the costs of these modifications and upgrading will not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations 
however  if such modifications and upgrades are not completed timely  the year may have a material impact on the operations of the company
