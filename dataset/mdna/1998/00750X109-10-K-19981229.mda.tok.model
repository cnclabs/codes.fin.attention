item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about the company s industry  management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or expressed in such statements 
except as required by law  the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview the company provides communications  information systems and applied technology services and solutions  predominantly to us government agencies and to a lesser extent commercial and international customers 
the company operates primarily in three interrelated areas communication services  information systems and applied technology 
the company has been profitable since its inception in  and has achieved a compound annual growth rate in revenues of over the past five fiscal years  with its substantial growth in fiscal year attributable to acquisitions 
the company s backlog  including both funded and unfunded backlog  was million at september  the company s acquisitions were primarily responsible for the increase in backlog from fiscal to fiscal many of the company s contracts are funded from year to year  based primarily on the procuring company s or agency s fiscal requirements 
the estimated backlog under a government contract is not necessarily indicative of revenues that will actually be realized under that contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of the company s contract backlog 
congress normally appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis  even though actual contract performance may take many years 
as a result  contracts ordinarily are only partially funded at the time of award  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency as appropriations are made by congress in subsequent fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that congress will appropriate funds or that procuring agencies will commit funds to the company s contracts for their anticipated terms 
in addition  most of the company s government contracts have a base term of one year and a number of option years 
there can be no assurance that the government will extend a contract through its option years 
many of the company s large contracts require that the company supply services upon request  and the company receives no payments under these contracts until such services are requested and performed 
there can be no assurance that cancellations or scope adjustments of these contracts might not occur or that the company s services under these contracts will be requested at the anticipated levels in the future

revenues  by dollar and percentage  from the company s three interrelated areas and three major types of customer are given below year ended september  dollars in thousands services provided communication services    information systems    applied technology  total    customer type us us    commercial   international   total    the company s operating margin is affected by  among other things  the mix of contract types cost reimbursement  fixed price or time and materials as well as the proportion of revenues from higher margin commercial and international sales 
additionally  semcor  the company s most recent acquisition  historically has experienced lower operating margins than the company  and therefore this acquisition is likely to lower the company s future operating margins 
a significant portion of the company s contracts are cost reimbursement contracts  under which the company is reimbursed for all actual costs  plus a fee or profit 
the financial risks under these contracts generally are lower than those associated with other types of contracts  and margins also are typically lower 
the company has also been awarded fixed price contracts by the government 
such contracts carry higher financial risks because the company must deliver the contracted services below the fixed price in order to earn a profit 
for those companies with low cost structures  these contracts offer the opportunity for higher profit margins 
the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the periods indicated year ended september  cost reimbursement fixed price time and materials total revenues on cost plus fixed fee contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fees earned 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
the company s two significant us navy communication services contracts and programs accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal although the company intends to expand its commercial and international sales  a relatively small number of contracts are likely to continue to account for a significant portion of the company s future revenues 
government contracts  including the company s gsa schedule contracts  by their terms  generally can be terminated at any time by the government without cause 
if a government contract is so terminated  the company generally would be entitled to receive compensation for the services provided or costs incurred up to the time of termination and a negotiated amount of the profit on the contract to the date of termination 
termination of any of its large government contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government contracts require compliance with various contract provisions and procurement regulations 
the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or increase its costs of competing for or performing government contracts 
any violation of these regulations could result in the termination of the contracts  imposition of fines and or debarment from award of additional government contracts 
most government contracts are subject to modification or termination for the convenience of the government in the event of changes in funding  and the company s contract costs and revenues are subject to adjustment as a result of audits by the dcaa and other government auditors 
the award of government contracts also is subject to protest by competitors which can result in the re opening of the bidding process  unanticipated legal costs or the award of a contract to a competitor 
government contracts generally are awarded to the company through a formal competitive bidding process in which the company has many competitors 
upon expiration  government contracts may be subject to a competitive rebidding process 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in winning contract awards or renewals in the future 
the company s failure to renew or replace such contracts when they expire could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were generated through small business set aside programs 
the company no longer is eligible to participate in some of these programs and  as its revenues and size expand  it will lose its eligibility to participate in more of these programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to replace revenues from these contracts 
the company also derives significant revenues from sales under the gsa schedule contracts 
for fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from the gsa schedule contracts 
the government has no obligation to purchase any significant amount of goods or services under the contracts and there can be no assurance as to the actual level of sales that will be derived from the contracts 
the gsa schedule contracts are fixed price contracts  which impose greater financial risk on the company than cost reimbursement or time and materials contracts 
failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract may reduce the company s profit or cause a loss 
in addition  the gsa schedule contracts are renewable every five years by the government 
the company s current gsa schedule contracts expire beginning in march through august there can be no assurance that the gsa schedule contracts will be renewed  and the company s inability to renew or replace the gsa schedule contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally uses commercially available products in its systems integration business  which are generally available from several sources 
the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies from its current suppliers in a timely manner 
the company believes that  in most cases  alternate vendors can be found if its current suppliers are unable to fulfill its needs 
during fiscal  revenues from international business amounted to of revenues 
the vast majority of the company s international business revenues are derived from sales of the company s products to foreign navies and the performance of services related to such sales 
because international business to date has had higher profit margins than us government business  an inability to obtain future international business could adversely affect the company s future operating margin 
because both the company s expenses and its revenues from its international business are generally denominated in us dollars  the company does not believe that its operations are subject to material risks associated with currency fluctuations 
a part of the company s business strategy calls for growth through acquisitions 
the company has successfully completed four acquisitions semcor in june  ami in february  isc in november and rfm in august since the respective dates of the acquisitions  the company has been integrating these acquired entities in order to draw on the company s base of technical expertise and capabilities in designing solutions for government and commercial clients 
there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions will be realized  that the company will operate the acquired businesses profitably in the future or that the company will be able to integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisitions without a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate any acquisition on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired business operations 
future acquisitions may entail the payment of consideration in excess of book value  may result in the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness and could have a dilutive effect on the company s net income per share 
the company s revenues have increased over the past five fiscal years at a compound annual rate of 
continued growth could place a significant strain on the company s limited personnel  management  financial controls and other resources 
the company s ability to manage any future expansion effectively will require it to attract  retain  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new management and employees into its overall operations and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems and controls and facilities 
the company s failure to manage any expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
