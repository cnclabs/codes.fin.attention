item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview since its inception in july  inhale has been engaged in the development of a pulmonary system for the delivery of macromolecules and other drugs for systemic and local lung applications 
the company has been unprofitable since inception and expects to incur significant and increasing additional operating losses over the next several years primarily due to increasing research and development expenditures and expansion of manufacturing facilities 
to date  inhale has not sold any products and does not anticipate receiving revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   the company incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
inhale s sources of working capital have been equity financings  financings of equipment acquisitions  interest earned on investments of cash  and revenues from short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts 
inhale typically has been compensated for research and development expenses incurred during initial feasibility work as well as for work performed under collaborative arrangements 
inhale s strategy is to enter into development contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporate partners after feasibility is demonstrated 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements will pay for research and development expenses and will make payments to inhale as it achieves certain key milestones 
inhale expects to receive royalties from its partners based on revenues received from product sales  and to receive revenue from the manufacturing of powders and the supply of devices 
in certain cases  the company may enter into collaborative agreements under which the company s partners would manufacture powders or supply inhalation devices  thereby potentially limiting one or more sources of revenue for the company 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products utilizing its pulmonary drug delivery system 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing internal resources to conduct a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
results of operations years ended december   and contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
costs of contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expense 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to expansion of the company s existing collaborative agreements as well as the signing of additional corporate partners in contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses represent proprietary research expenses as well as the costs related to contract research revenue and include salaries and benefits of scientific and development personnel  laboratory supplies  consulting services  facilities  costs of obtaining intellectual property protection for inhale s technologies and expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes 
the million increase in research and development expenses in from and the million increase in research and development expenses in from are primarily attributed to continued expansion of research activities resulting from an increase in the number of projects  hiring of additional scientific personnel  costs associated with the development of the company s commercial manufacturing facility and increased costs of laboratory supplies and consulting services 
the company expects research and development and process development spending to increase significantly over the next few years as the company expands its development efforts under collaborative agreements and plans  builds and scales up a late stage clinical and early commercial manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in from and the  increase in from were due primarily to costs associated with supporting the company s increased research efforts including administrative staffing  business development activities and marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next few years as the company expands its research  development and manufacturing activities 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in from was due to the company maintaining larger cash and investment balances 
the higher cash and investment balances are a result of the company receiving research funding and milestone payments from collaborative partners  the completion of a private placement of the company s common stock in february which raised net proceeds of million as well as the completion of a public offering of the company s common stock in november which raised net proceeds of million 
the increase in interest income in from was due primarily to interest earned on higher average cash balances as a result of baxter making a million equity investment in inhale at a premium to market price in conjunction with the march development agreement between the company and baxter 
in addition  in october pfizer made an additional million investment in inhale pursuant to the january agreement between the company and pfizer to develop insulin products using inhale s non invasive pulmonary drug delivery system 
at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitation provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of its equity securities  contract research revenues  interest income earned on its investments of cash and financing of equipment acquisitions 
in its initial public offering completed may  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million and raised additional net proceeds of million in its public offering completed in march on february  the company completed a private placement of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in november the company completed a public offering of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in may  the company obtained a million line of credit which may be drawn upon to finance the purchases of equipment and facility improvements 
as of december   the company had not drawn on this line of credit 
the company secured a million loan in november to also finance the purchases of equipment and facility improvements 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
the company s operations provided cash of million and used cash of million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from the company s net operating losses in these periods principally due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  depreciation expenses and deferred revenue 
additionally  in the company recorded a non cash transaction of  in connection with the completion of a licensing agreement 
the company purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  is primarily due to the build out of the company s new facility in san carlos  california as well as the acquisition of laboratory equipment to support its research activities 
the company expects its cash requirements to increase due to expected increases in expenses related to the further research and development of its technologies resulting from a larger number of projects  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  purchases of capital equipment  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion  including the planning and building of a late stage clinical and early stage commercial manufacturing facility 
the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  together with interest income and possible additional equipment financing  will be sufficient to meet its operating expense and capital expenditure requirements at least through however  the company s capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its research and development arrangements  progress with pre clinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scale up of the company s powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of its late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy its long term needs  the company intends to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all
