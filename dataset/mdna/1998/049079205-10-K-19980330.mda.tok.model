item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
gt t derives almost all of its revenues from international telephone services 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  international long distance expenses and taxes other than income taxes 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and amortization 
for accounting purposes  the split up transaction of the company into two separate publicly held companies the company and the emerging communications  inc has been treated as a non pro rata split off of the company 
the company has been considered to be the split off entity since emerging communications had a greater market capitalization and greater asset value immediately after the transaction  retained more of the pre transaction top management of the company and had greater net income in in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
entitled accounting for nonmonetary transactions and emerging issues task force entitled accounting for reorganizations involving a non pro rata split off of certain nonmonetary assets to owners  the balance sheet of the company at december  has been adjusted to values determined by the market capitalization of the company immediately after the consummation of the transaction 
this adjustment includes an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated net fixed assets  and an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated stockholder s equity 
the fair value adjustment reduced the carrying value on the company s consolidated financial statements of its fixed assets significantly below their historical cost and replacement value 
therefore  depreciation expense in the future not will be a reliable indicator of the company s cost of replenishing its assets 
the financial statements included in this report are the separate financial statements relating to atlantic tele network  inc s business and operations in guyana including its majority owned subsidiary  gt t  and atn s activities as the parent company of all of its subsidiaries during the periods included herein 
except for the consolidated balance sheet at december   these financial statements do not reflect the fair valuation adjustment arising from the split up transaction 
moreover  the statements of operations include interest income from indebtedness of subsidiaries which were transferred with such indebtedness to emerging communications  inc in the split up transaction and certain expenses for the period from may  to december  which were reimbursed by emerging communications  inc as part of the split up transaction 
as a result of the decline in in gt t s revenues and profits from audiotext traffic  gt t filed on december  an application with the puc seeking rates designed to generate approximately million in additional revenues in for local and outbound international traffic 
in january  gt t was awarded an interim increase effective february  designed by the puc to generate the equivalent of approximately million in additional annual revenues for gt t 
the interim rates are intended to remain in effect while the puc holds hearings and reaches a decision on gt t s application for permanent rates  although the puc may increase or decrease these interim rates before reaching a decision on gt t s permanent rates 
no assurance can be given as to what permanent rates the puc will award gt t or as to what changes the puc may make in the current interim rates 
results of operations years ended december  and operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the corresponding period of the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was principally due to a million  or  decrease in audiotext traffic revenues at gt t for the year ended december  gt t s volume of audiotext traffic fluctuated between and million minutes per month in in  the volume of audiotext traffic declined during the year to approximately million minutes per month in the fourth quarter 
the reduction in traffic volume is estimated to account for approximately million  or of the million decrease in audiotext revenues in chargebacks from a carrier for the year ended december  approximated million  representing of the decline in revenues from audiotext traffic 
while subject to change  the company anticipates that it will experience chargebacks in the future as a proportion of audiotext revenue similar to that experienced for the year ended december  the remaining million  or of the decrease in audiotext revenues  results from a combination of the following the mislabeling of the origin of certain traffic  changes in the traffic mix  certain accounting rate reductions  and the strength of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies 
mislabeling of the origin of traffic occurs when a carrier reports traffic as coming from one country when it actually originated in another 
changes in traffic mix refers to the mix between countries of origins which have different accounting rates  and accounting rate reductions occur when the company and a foreign administration telephone company agree to a change in rates 
the changes in volume of traffic and lower accounting rates are subject to a number of influences beyond the company s control  and may change significantly in the future  positively or negatively 
as a result of the above factors  gt t s profit margins from this traffic also declined 
given the company s recent experience  the company expects the negative trend in audiotext revenues to continue which could have a material adverse impact on the company s total revenues  although the company is unable to predict the magnitude of the decline in future revenues with any degree of certainty 
gt t s outbound international revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the prior year even though traffic volumes were approximately lower in then in see business regulatory considerations for further discussion 
the increase in revenues was principally a result of the recognition of million in revenues relating to outbound international long distance revenues at gt t for the period from october to january the balance of the increase is attributable to the restoration in january of the higher rates that were in effect in october operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or  from operating expenses of million for the prior year 
the decrease was due principally to a decrease in audiotext and outbound traffic expense at gt t of million for the year ended december   due to decreased traffic volumes 
somewhat offsetting the decrease was an increase in plant specific and plant non specific expenses which increased as a result of increased plant in service 
as a percentage of operating revenues  operating expenses increased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the prior year 
income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or  from income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest of million for the prior year 
this decrease is principally a result of the factors affecting revenues and operating expenses discussed above  even though gt t recognized approximately million of revenues relating to outbound international long distance revenues for the period october to january discussed above 
net interest expense decreased  due to reduced debt resulting in income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million or  compared to million for the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period of the prior year 
the minority interest in earnings consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
pro forma net income per share adjusts the company s depreciation expense  interest expense  and shares outstanding as if the split off transaction had occurred on january  no adjustment is made for any reduction in the company s general and administrative expense which may result from the transaction or for the interim rate increase awarded to gt t by the puc effective february  or for any further changes in gt t s rates 
years ended december  and operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due principally to a million increase in audiotext traffic revenues at gt t 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due principally to increases in audiotext and outbound traffic expenses at gt t of million due to increased traffic volume 
as a result of a rate decrease ordered by the guyana puc on october   gt t s outbound international traffic increased by approximately during the year ended december  resulting in an approximately million increase in outbound traffic expenses 
an additional factor contributing to the increase in operating expenses was plant specific expense which increased as a result of increased plant in service 
overall  income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease occurred principally because of negative margins on outbound traffic at gt t which in turn  was caused principally by rate decreases ordered by the puc in october in january  the guyana high court voided the puc s order and permitted gt t to restore its rates for outbound traffic to their pre october level 
while these rates are also less than the associated outbound expense  had these rates been in effect throughout  the company estimates that gt t s income from telephone operations in would have been approximately million greater than it was  assuming gt t s volume of traffic remained unchanged 
audiotext traffic increased million minutes and other gt t inbound paid and outcollect traffic increased million minutes for the year ended december  however  these revenue increases at gt t were more than offset by increased international long distance  plant  and other operating expenses discussed above 
gt t s audiotext traffic increased sharply in the first months of hitting a peak of million minutes for the month of august from august through december audiotext traffic fluctuated between approximately million and million minutes per month 
profit margins from this traffic decreased approximately in principally due to a shift in traffic mix to less profitable countries and reductions some in accounting rates 
income before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the significant factors that contributed to this decrease for the year ended december  were the million decrease in income from operations discussed above and the million decrease in net interest expense due to decreased interest rates and lower outstanding debt 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the million decrease in income tax expense was principally due to lower taxable income 
the minority interest in earnings consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
regulatory considerations as is discussed above under introduction  gt t has applied to the puc for a significant increase in rates for local and outbound international service and has received interim rates which substantially increases the rates in effect during and earlier years 
upon the acquisition of gt t in january  gt t entered into an agreement with the government of guyana to expand significantly gt t s existing facilities and telecommunications operations and to improve service within a three year period pursuant to an expansion and service improvement plan the plan 
the plan was modified in certain respects and the date for completion of the plan was extended to february the government has referred to the guyana public utilities commission puc the failure of gt t to complete the plan by february the puc is currently holding hearings on this matter 
it is gt t s position that its failure to receive timely rate increases  to which gt t was entitled  to compensate for the devaluation in guyana currency which occurred in provides legal justification for gt t s delay in completing the expansion plan 
failure to timely fulfill the terms of the plan without legal justification could result in monetary penalties  cancellation of the license  or other action by the puc or the government which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and prospects 
in october  the guyana public utilities commission puc issued an order that rejected a request of gt t for substantial increases in all telephone rates and temporarily reduced rates for outbound long distance calls to certain countries 
in most cases  the existing rates were already less than gt t s payment obligations to foreign carriers 
in january  on an appeal by gt t  the guyana high court voided the puc s order in regard to rates and the rates were returned to the rates in existence in october the lost revenue was approximately million for the period when the order was effective 
gt t initially instituted such a surcharge effective may   but temporarily withdrew it when the guyana consumers advisory bureau a non governmental group in guyana instituted a suit to block it 
in may the consumer advisory bureau sought an injunction from the guyana high court restoring telephone rates to those imposed by the puc in its october order 
the consumer advisory bureau s application is still pending 
in september  the guyana high court denied an order which the consumer advisory bureau had sought to temporarily enjoin gt t from putting into effect a surcharge to recover the approximately million over a period of months 
gt t put such surcharge into effect on october  pending an ultimate trial on the merits  and the company recognized the approximately million of lost revenues in the third quarter of in january  the puc ordered gt t to cease paying advisory fees to the company and to recover from the company approximately million of such fees paid by gt t to the company since january gt t has appealed the puc s order to the guyana high court and obtained a stay of the puc s order pending determination of that appeal 
at december   gt t owed the company approximately million for advances made from time to time for the working capital and capital expenditure needs of gt t 
gt t s indebtedness to the company was evidenced by a series of promissory notes 
in march  the puc voided substantially all of the promissory notes then outstanding for failure to comply with certain provisions of the puc law 
the puc ordered that no further payments be made on any of the outstanding notes and that gt t recover from the company all amounts theretofore paid 
the order also provided that the puc would be willing to authorize the payment of any amounts properly proven to the satisfaction of the puc to be due and payable from gt t to the company 
gt t has appealed the puc s order to the guyana high court and obtained a stay of the puc s order pending determination of that appeal 
in late april  the puc applied to the guyana high court for orders prohibiting gt t from paying any monies to the company on account of intercompany debt  advisory fees or otherwise pending the determination of gt t s appeals from the january and march orders mentioned above 
the puc s application is still pending 
in october  the puc ordered gt t to increase the number of telephone lines in service to a total of  lines by the end of   lines by the end of and  by the end of the year  to allocate and connect an additional  telephone lines before the end of the and to provide to subscribers who request them facilities for call diversion  call waiting  reminder call and three way calling by the end of the year in issuing this order  the puc did not hear evidence or make any findings on the cost of providing these lines and services  the adjustment in telephone rates which may be necessary to give gt t a fair return on its investment or the ways and means of financing the requirements of the puc s order 
gt t has filed a motion against the puc s order in the guyana high court and has appealed the order on different grounds to the guyana court of appeal 
no stay currently exists against this order  but recently the puc requested further information from gt t on this matter 
gt t intends to take such steps to seek a stay or modification of this order as seem appropriate after the level of demand for telephone service can be assessed in light of the temporary rates which came into effect on february  in may  gt t received a letter from the guyana commissioner of inland revenue indicating that gt t s tax returns for through had been selected for an audit under the direct supervision of the trade minister with particular focus on the withholding tax on payments to international audiotext providers 
in march and april  the guyanese trade minister publicly announced that he had appointed a task force to probe whether gt t should pay withholding taxes on fees paid by gt t to international audiotext providers 
the minister announced that if gt t were found guilty of tax evasion it could owe as much as million in back taxes 
in july  gt t applied to the guyana high court for an order prohibiting this audit on the grounds that the decision of the minister of trade to set up this task force and to control and direct its investigation was beyond his authority  violated the provisions of the guyanese income tax act  interfered with the independence of the commissioner of inland revenue and was done in bad faith  and the court issued an order effectively staying the audit pending a determination by the court of the merits of gt t s application 
in june  gt t received an assessment of approximately million from the commissioner of inland revenue for taxes for based on the disallowance as a deduction for income tax purposes of five sixths of the advisory fees payable by gt t to the company and for the timing of the taxation on certain surcharges to be billed by gt t 
the deductibility of these advisory fees and the deferral of these surcharges until they are actually billed for an earlier year had been upheld in a decision of the high court in august in july  gt t applied to the high court for an order prohibiting the commissioner of inland revenue from further proceeding with this assessment on the grounds that the assessment was arbitrary and unreasonable and capriciously contrary to the august decision of the guyana high court  and gt t obtained an order of the high court effectively prohibiting any action on the assessment pending the determination by the court of the merits of gt t s application 
in november  gt t received assessments of approximately million from the commissioner of inland revenue for taxes for the years through it is gt t s understanding that these assessments stem from the same audit commenced in may which the guyana high court stayed in its july order referred to above 
apparently because the audit was cut short as a result of the court s july order  gt t did not receive notice of and an opportunity to respond to the proposed assessments as is the customary practice in guyana  and substantially all of the issues raised in the assessments appear to be based on mistaken facts 
gt t has applied to the guyana high court for an order prohibiting the commissioner of inland revenue from enforcing the assessments on the grounds that the origin of the audit with the minister of trade and the failure to give gt t notice of and opportunity to respond to the proposed assessments violated guyana law 
the guyana high court has issued an order effectively prohibiting any action on the assessments pending the determination by the court of the merits of gt t s application 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any of the above described pending tax issues 
liquidity and capital resources the company has depended upon funds received from its subsidiaries to meet its capital needs  including servicing existing debt and its ongoing program of seeking to acquire telecommunications licenses and businesses 
as a result of the split up of the company into two separate public companies  the company s capital resources have changed significantly  and the company has fewer resources and significantly reduced operations 
for the near term future  the company s primary sources of funds will be advisory fees  repayment of loans  and interest from gt t 
the puc orders in january  march  and october  discussed above under regulatory considerations  could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
however  gt t s own capital needs and debt service obligations have precluded gt t in recent years  from paying any significant funds to the company other than the advisory fees and interest on intercompany debt mentioned above 
if and when the company settles outstanding issues with the guyana government and the puc with regard to gt t s expansion plan and its rates for service  gt t may require additional external financing to enable gt t to further expand its telecommunications facilities 
the company has not estimated the cost to comply with the october puc order to increase the number of telephone lines in service  but believes such a project would require significant capital expenditures that would require external financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
the company anticipates that gt t s foreign currency earnings will enable gt t to service its debt and pay its hard currency tax obligations 
there are no guyana legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana s currency into us dollars or on the expatriation of foreign currency from guyana 
impact of devaluation and inflation although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in  however  the guyana dollar has declined in value to approximately to the us dollar  and it has remained relatively stable at approximately that rate since subsequent to december   the guyana dollar has declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
the effect of devaluation and inflation on the company s financial results has not been significant in the periods presented
