item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company changed its fiscal year end from the last day of february to december  effective as of december  the change resulted in a short period of ten months that began march   and ended december  information for calendar refers to the ten months ended december   and fiscal refers to the twelve months ended february  the growth in the company s operating revenues and net earnings during was the result of an increase in the number of acute and subacute units  and growth from acquisitions 
the results reflect an increase in the average number of acute units as a result of fewer unit closures  an increase in the average number of subacute units managed by the company from to  increased weeks worked at hssi and the acquisition of team and moore 
outpatient revenue decreased in  reflecting a two unit reduction in average number of units 
the growth for calendar was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of subacute units and results from hssi 
calendar reflects an increase in the average number of subacute units from to outpatient revenue decreased in calendar  reflecting the closure of three locations 
in the normal course of business  new units are opened and some existing units are closed each year 
during the first year of operation  a new acute rehabilitation unit will typically be subject to limitations in reimbursement from medicare considerably below the hospital s operating cost 
as a consequence  during this period the company agrees with the client hospital to bear certain start up costs on the hospital s behalf and to waive a portion of its fees until the unit qualifies for an exemption from medicare limitations 
the company assists the hospital in qualifying the unit for the exemption and in minimizing the unreimbursed costs during this non exempt period 
the company s average operating losses during the qualifying period can range to as high as  to  per unit 
if the company does not obtain an exemption for the unit  the contract may be terminated and  in the event of termination  start up losses would generally not be recoverable 
upon completion of the qualifying year and obtaining the exemption  the hospital is eligible to recover all of its costs related to the operation of the unit  including the company s fees under the management contract 
once a unit becomes exempt  the unit experiences accelerated growth in operating revenues and profitability as the patient population is expanded in response to the more favorable reimbursement terms 
subacute units and outpatient programs are not subject to the same limitations in reimbursement from medicare as acute rehabilitation units and  therefore  should result in significantly reduced start up losses per unit
