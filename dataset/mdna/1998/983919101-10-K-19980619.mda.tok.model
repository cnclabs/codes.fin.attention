nature of operations xilinx  inc xilinx or the company designs  develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions  including advanced integrated circuits ics  software design tools  predefined system functions delivered as cores of logic and field engineering support 
the company s programmable logic ics include field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds 
these components are standard ics programmed by xilinx s customers to perform desired logic operations 
xilinx also markets hardwire devices  which are mask programmed ics functionally equivalent to programmed fpgas 
the company s products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the data processing  telecommunications  networking  industrial control  instrumentation  high reliability military and consumer markets 
the company markets its products throughout the world through a direct sales organization  direct sales to manufacturers by independent sales representative firms  sales through franchised domestic distributors and sales through foreign distributors 
xilinx s products have provided effective solutions to a wide range of customer logic requirements 
results of operations revenue in thousands change change revenues    the company s revenue increase in was primarily attributable to the revenue growth of the xcx product family  which includes the xcex and xcxl devices  as well as revenue growth from the xc and xc product families 
the revenue growth from these products was offset by decreased revenues from the company s first generation products  including the company s xc product family and the company s xc family  a mature second generation product line 
new products  which include the xcx  spartan and xc families  contributed nearly million in revenue in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal despite the significant growth in new product revenues  fiscal revenues increased only over fiscal as revenues were impacted by an overall slowdown in the semiconductor market  increased price competition  inventory reductions at end customers and a general economic downturn in the asia pacific region 
fiscal revenues  as compared to fiscal  were significantly impacted by price competition as well as a semiconductor industry inventory correction  which reduced customer demand 
revenue contribution by programmable logic product line reflected a mix between increased customer demand for low cost  medium range density programmable logic devices plds and the functionality and performance provided by the company s higher density and higher speed programmable logic devices 
revenues from proprietary products  for which there is no second source competitor  increased from of aggregate revenues in to a record in deriving revenues from leading edge programmable logic solutions has been emphasized by the company 
the company s corporate pricing strategy aims to expand the market for its products by reducing sales prices proportional to cost reductions achieved in the manufacturing of these products 
the company intends to continue to actively pursue a strategy of broadening the markets it serves through the enhancement of software design tools  availability of pre defined cores of logic  the introduction of architectures offering new functionality  and the reduction of ic prices through continuous advancements in the silicon manufacturing process 
revenues for the company s first generation products  which include the xc  xc and xc families  represented of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the company s second generation products  including the xc  xcx and xc families  represented of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal combined revenues from the company s xc and xcx product lines represented of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal  a dollar increase of to million 
revenues from other programmable logic products  which include the xc and xc cpld families  hardwire and serial proms  increased from to of total revenues in fiscal as compared to the prior year  mostly due to the increased revenue from the xc family 
revenue from the xc family increased from million in to million in no single end customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal years or or of revenues in during fiscal  the company s total pld unit sales increased  as compared to fiscal the average selling price for the highest volume pld products decreased over from fiscal prices while individual products within certain families experienced price decreases in excess of during the year 
the company believes that price decreases are instrumental in expanding market share to the extent that the company can maintain acceptable returns 
price erosion has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in cost 
the company relies upon introducing new products  which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors such that higher average selling prices and higher margins are achievable despite the price erosion on mature product lines 
xilinx s software design tools are used by the company s customers to implement designs in the company s programmable logic devices 
cumulative licenses for proprietary software design tools sold to customers through the end of totaled approximately  units  as compared to approximately  and  units at the end of and  respectively 
the increase in software revenue seats resulted primarily from increased demand for the company s lower cost  easier to use foundation series software introduced in fiscal software revenues decreased from million in both fiscal and to million in fiscal although software seats increased  software revenue decreased due to the change in the sales mix towards lower priced products as well as price reductions for specific products 
software sales as a percentage of total revenues represented approximately of revenues in all years presented 
international revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
international revenues are derived from customers in europe  japan and asia pacific rest of world which represented approximately  and of the company s worldwide sales  respectively  in fiscal revenue growth in europe and asia pacific rest of world over the past year was and  respectively 
revenues from japan were adversely impacted by the weakening yen  as yen denominated revenues increased approximately year to year but grew approximately when translated into us dollars at the then prevailing exchange rates 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of revenue includes write off of discontinued product family of million 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was excluding this charge 
the gross margin percentage remained consistent from fiscal to  excluding the impact of a million write off of the discontinued product family  as the selling price reductions were offset by the favorable impact of lower wafer prices from wafer suppliers  manufacturing process technology improvements  the impact of the strengthened us dollar exchange rate against the yen  and improved yields 
the increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in as compared to was primarily attributable to selling price reductions and increased inventory reserves relating to an expanded level of inventory  partially offset by the favorable impact of lower wafer costs and improved yields 
over the past three years  xilinx has also been able to offset much of the erosion in gross margin percentages on more mature integrated circuits with increased volumes of newer  proprietary  higher margin products  although no assurance can be given that the company will do so in the future 
the company recognizes that ongoing price reductions for its integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding the market for its products 
company management believes that gross margin objectives in the range of to of revenues are consistent with expanding market share while realizing acceptable returns  although there can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this range 
during fiscal  the company discontinued the xc family of one time programmable antifuse devices 
as a result  the company recorded a pretax charge against earnings of million 
this charge primarily related to the write off of inventory and for termination charges related to purchase commitments to foundry partners for work in process wafers which had not completed the manufacturing process 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of revenue the company continued to increase the amount spent on research and development  as it has done in each year of its fourteen year history 
during fiscal  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the increased costs associated with designing and developing new product architectures of complex  high density devices as well as labor related expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to was primarily attributable to increased headcount and labor expenses  increased purchases of engineering wafers and increased facility and support costs associated with an expanded scope of operations 
the company remains committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to continue to compete aggressively in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   the company has received more than us patents and maintains an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of software  ic architecture and design 
as of march   research and development personnel were split approximately for software development and for ic design and process development 
xilinx has not capitalized any of the costs associated with its software development 
marketing  general and administrative in thousands change change marketing  general and administrative    percentage of revenue the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in headcount and related employee expenses and to a lessor extent an increase in legal expenses 
sales and support expenses have increased each year due to increasing personnel and labor costs and greater commission expenses associated with higher revenues 
sales and support expenses increased in fiscal over due to increased personnel and labor costs and increased commissions due to changes in the revenue channel mix 
the company remains committed to controlling administrative expenses 
however  the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may significantly increase the level of general and administrative expenses in the future 
non recurring charges during fiscal  the company incurred a million non recurring write off of in process technology relating to the acquisition of neocad  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income in thousands change change operating income  as reported    percentage of revenue operating income before write off and non recurring charge    percentage of revenue the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues in from  before consideration of the write off  is primarily a result of the revenue growth in in comparison to a increase year to year in research and development spending  and an increase in marketing  general and administrative spending 
the decrease in operating income in fiscal from was primarily a result of the revenue growth in in comparison to increases year to year in both research and development spending and marketing  general and administrative spending 
operating income as a percentage of revenues could be adversely impacted in future years by the factors discussed throughout this document  particularly those noted in factors affecting future operating results 
interest and other  net in thousands change change interest income and other    percentage of revenue the company earns interest income on its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments 
the amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates 
the company incurs interest expense on the million convertible subordinated notes issued in november the company s investment portfolio contains tax advantaged municipal securities  which have pretax yields that are less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes 
for financial reporting purposes  the company effectively records the difference between the pretax and tax equivalent yields as a reduction in provision for taxes on income 
interest and other income for remained consistent with the amount in in  average cash and investment balances and average interest rates remained fairly consistent with the prior year  resulting in comparable net interest and other income over both years 
the increase in interest income in fiscal over the prior year was primarily attributable to higher investment portfolio balances and joint venture equity income 
as a result of the difference in interest income and expense yields and future uses of the company s investment portfolio  levels of net interest and other income could decrease in the future 
provision for income taxes in thousands change change provision for taxes on income    effective tax rate includes non recurring write off of in process technology relating to the acquisition of neocad 
excluding the write off of in process technology  in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was 
the tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal  as well as the tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal  was favorably impacted by legislation reinstating the r d tax credit as well as increased profits in foreign operations where the tax rate is lower that the us rate 
joint venture equity income the company records its proportional ownership of the net income of united silicon inc usic  a wafer fabrication joint venture located in taiwan  as joint venture equity income 
to date  usic s net income has resulted primarily from favorable foreign currency exchange gains as well as interest earned on its investment portfolio 
through the second quarter of fiscal  equity income was immaterial and remains classified in interest income and other 
the company expects to incur joint venture equity losses during most of fiscal as the usic wafer fabrication facility begins to ramp up production 
many of the expenses associated with full foundry operation will be incurred in the early stages of limited production  and the company expects that profitability of the joint venture will occur  if at all  only after a sufficient volume of wafer production is obtained 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation upon the company s financial results have not been significant 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition at march  remained strong 
total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by times  compared to times at march  since its inception  the company has used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash flow from operations to support on going business activities  make acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies  obtain facilities and capital equipment and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments xilinx s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million in as cash was used to fund investing and financing activities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represented of total assets at march  the company generated cash flow of million from operating activities in  offset by million of cash used for investing activities and million used in financing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included expenditures for property  plant and equipment together with a deposit for a facility under construction on the san jose corporate campus  an additional investment in the usic joint venture and additional advances to seiko epson for wafer purchases 
investment proceeds were received from the net maturity of short term investments 
financing activities during included million to acquire treasury stock offset by million in proceeds from sales of common stock under employee option and stock purchase plans 
receivables receivables decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of in addition  days sales outstanding at the end of each year decreased from days in to days in in fiscal receivables decreased as the company increased collection efforts relating to international sales as well as increased allowances for pricing adjustments and customer returns 
inventories inventories decreased from million at march to million at march inventory levels at march  represent days of inventory  which is in line with the company s objective of to days  compared to days at march  inventory levels decreased during fiscal as both architecture and manufacturing process technology improvements have permitted continued cost reductions as well as continued improvement of inventory management 
the company seeks to balance two contradictory objectives with regard to inventory management 
on the one hand  the company believes that its standard  off the shelf products should be available for prompt shipment to customers 
accordingly  it attempts to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet estimates of customer demand 
at the same time  the company also wishes to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to realize fully the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements 
the company continually strives to balance these two objectives so as to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
advances for wafer purchases in fiscal  the company signed an agreement with seiko epson  a primary wafer supplier 
this agreement was amended in fiscal and now provides for an advance to seiko epson of million 
in conjunction with the agreement  million was paid in fiscal and an additional million was paid in fiscal repayment of this advance is in the form of wafer deliveries  which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal specific wafer pricing is based upon the prices of similar wafers manufactured by other  specifically identified  leading edge foundry suppliers 
the advance payment provision also provides for interest to be paid to the company in the form of free wafers 
property  plant and equipment during  xilinx invested million in property and equipment  as compared to million in during  the company purchased land in longmont  colorado for approximately million and continued to invest in software development tools and semiconductor design  test and manufacturing equipment at each of its manufacturing locations 
current liabilities current liabilities increased from million in fiscal to million at the end of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to increased sales through distribution as well as distributor demand for new product lines 
long term debt and lines of credit in november  the company issued million in convertible subordinated notes 
the company has credit line facilities for up to million of which million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for the company s ireland manufacturing facility 
at march  and  no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in to million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to million in net income and million related to the issuance of common stock and the tax benefit from stock options  partially offset by the million used to acquire treasury stock 
subsequent to march   the company began an additional treasury stock program to purchase up to approximately million shares as market and business conditions warrant 
stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets was for and for commitments the company invested an additional million in the usic joint venture in fiscal to bring the total investment in usic at the end of fiscal to million 
the company currently holds a equity ownership in usic and the right to receive of the wafer capacity from this facility 
under the terms of the agreement entered into between the company and usic  the company may be required to make a third equity installment of up to an additional million in the joint venture during fiscal  if warranted based on the capital and operational requirements of the joint venture 
united microelectronics corporation umc has committed to and is supplying the company with wafers manufactured in an existing facility until capacity is available in the usic facility 
the company is accounting for this investment using the equity method 
see further discussion in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as the us dollar increased in value relative to the new taiwan dollar during fiscal  adjustments were made to the carrying value of the investment of approximately million since its inception 
offsetting amounts were recorded to the cumulative translation adjustment account within stockholders equity 
employees during  xilinx experienced a increase in the number of its employees 
the company had  employees at the end of fiscal as compared to  at the end of the prior year 
the company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer supply capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that would complement the company s businesses and may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
factors affecting future operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competitive pressure and cyclical market patterns characterized by diminished product demand  limited visibility to demand for products further out than three to nine months  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and overcapacity 
the company s results of operations are affected by a wide variety of factors  including general economic conditions  conditions relating to technology companies  conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  decreases in average selling prices over the life of any particular product  the timing of new product introductions by the company  its competitors and others  the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for others 
market demand for the company s products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if the company were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given quarter 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
due to the foregoing and other factors  past results  including those described in this report  are much less reliable predictors of the future than is the case in many older  more stable and less dynamic industries 
based on the factors noted herein  the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  sales  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
particularly important are those highly skilled design  process  software and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
sales and operations outside of the united states subject the company to risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
specifically  the company has sales and operations in the asian markets 
the recent instability in the asian financial markets has adversely impacted sales and may continue to adversely impact sales in those markets in several ways  including reduced access to sources of capital needed by customers to make purchases and increased exchange rate differentials that may adversely effect the customer s ability to purchase or the company s ability to sell at competitive prices 
in addition  the instability may increase credit risks as the recent weakening of certain asian currencies may impair customers ability to repay existing obligations 
depending on the situation in asia in coming quarters  any or all of these factors could adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations in the near future 
additionally  risks include government regulation of exports  tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and generally longer receivable collection periods 
the company s business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future or what  if any  effect such actions would have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in order to expand international sales and service  the company will need to maintain and expand existing foreign operations or establish new foreign operations 
this entails hiring additional personnel and maintaining or expanding existing relationships with international distributors and sales representatives 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources and could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign operations  in its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts to maintain or expand its relationships with international distributors or sales representatives 
many of the company s operations are centered in an area of california that has been seismically active 
should there be a major earthquake in this area  the company s operations may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the company to manufacture or ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
dependence upon independent manufacturers and subcontractors the company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products 
during the past two years  most of the company s wafers have been manufactured by seiko epson corporation seiko epson and umc 
the company has depended upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes  including transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields  and delivering them to the company in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met the company s requirements to date  there can be no assurance that the company s wafer suppliers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies 
additionally  disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including natural disasters such as fires or earthquakes as well as disrupted access to adequate supplies of electricity  natural gas or water would cause delays in shipments of the company s products  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely deliveries from these manufacturers and subcontractors  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments  and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s growth will depend in large part on the company s ability to obtain increased wafer fabrication capacity and assembly services from suppliers which are cost effective 
in order to secure additional wafer capacity  the company from time to time considers alternatives  including  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to  independent wafer manufacturers to secure production capacity  or the use of contracts which commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
although the company is currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner  the company has at times been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in satisfaction of customer delivery dates  as well as the ability of the company to process products for shipment 
in addition  a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce the company s supply of wafers or increase the company s cost of such wafers 
such events could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
litigation the company is currently engaged in patent litigation with altera corporation altera 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time 
management believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and is defending them vigorously 
the foregoing is a forward looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties  and the future outcome could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of the litigation with altera and because the lawsuits are still in the pre trial stage 
dependence on new products the company s future success depends in large part on its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products which address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price  functionality and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion of new product designs  the ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies  achievement of acceptable yields  availability of supporting software design tools  utilization of predefined cores of logic and market acceptance 
no assurance can be given that the company s product development efforts will be successful or that its new products will achieve market acceptance 
revenues relating to some of the company s mature products are expected to continue to decline in the future as a percentage of total revenues 
as a result  the company will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products 
in addition  the average selling price for any particular product tends to decrease rapidly over the product s life 
to offset such decreases  the company relies primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors such that higher average selling prices and higher margins are achievable relative to mature product lines 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or the company s products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition the company s field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds compete in the programmable logic marketplace  with a substantial majority of the company s revenues derived from its fpga product families 
the industries in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and continuous price erosion 
the company expects significantly increased competition both from existing competitors and from a number of companies that may enter its market 
xilinx believes that important competitive factors in the programmable logic market include price  product performance and reliability  adaptability of products to specific applications  ease of use and functionality of software design tools  functionality of predefined cores of logic and the ability to provide timely customer service and support 
the company s strategy for expansion in the programmable logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures which address high volume  low cost applications as well as high performance  leading edge density applications and continued price reductions proportionate with the ability to lower the cost of manufacture for established products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving these strategies 
the company s major sources of competition are comprised of several elements the manufacturers of custom cmos gate arrays  providers of high density programmable logic products characterized by fpga type architectures  providers of high speed  low density cplds devices and other providers of new or emerging programmable logic products 
the company competes with custom gate array manufacturers on the basis of lower design costs  shorter development schedules and reduced inventory risks 
the primary attributes of custom gate arrays are high density  high speed and low production costs in high volumes 
the company continues to develop lower cost architectures intended to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs in high volumes and pld production costs 
the company competes with high density programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance  the ability to deliver complete solutions to customers  voltage and customer support  taking advantage of the primary characteristics of flexible  high speed implementation and quick time to market capabilities of the company s pld product offerings 
competition among cpld suppliers is based primarily on price  performance  design  software utility and the ability to deliver complete solutions to customers 
in addition  the company competes with manufacturers of new or emerging programmable logic products on the basis of price  performance  customer support  software utility and the ability to deliver complete solutions to customers 
some of the company s current or potential competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than xilinx 
to the extent that such efforts to compete are not successful  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
intellectual property the company relies upon patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect its intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including competitors of the company  have asserted patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources of the company 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance as is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations  the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems  as well as the vendor and customer date sensitive computerized information electronically transferred to the company 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems that have time sensitive software may recognize the year as rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations  classification errors or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues on a timely basis  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
market rate risks interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s primary aim with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
the portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds  tax advantaged auction rate preferred municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us treasury securities 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  the company places investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
all securities have remaining maturities less than one year as of the balance sheet date  and the company believes it has the ability to hold its investments until maturity 
therefore  the company does not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk related to outstanding long term debt 
if long term market interest rates decrease  the effective cost of the debt will increase 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risks  the long term debt fixed interest rate liability has been matched against the company s short term variable interest rate assets through a liability interest rate swap agreement 
the liability swap exchanges one half of the underlying debt amount based on a fixed interest rate for the same amount based on variable interest rates 
if interest rates rise by  the cash flow impact of the swap would continue to be immaterial and would be offset by the increase in short term investment interest rates 
this contract was entered into for a two and a half year period and will end in november as the long term debt may be outstanding until november  the company will continue to evaluate its strategy related to the fixed rate debt 
the table below summarizes the company s investment  debt and interest rate swap notional amounts as of march  as well as weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the next four years and thereafter 
the fair value as of march  is also shown 
maturity date fair value in thousands march  total assets available for sale securities    average pre tax interest rate held to maturity securities    average interest rate liabilities convertible long term debt    average interest rate interest rate derivative financial instruments interest rate swap pay variable receive fixed   average pay rate usd month libor average receive rate foreign currency risk through fiscal year  the company s purchases of processed silicon wafers from japanese foundries have been denominated in yen 
to help offset the company s exposure for yen denominated liabilities  the company s sales to japanese customers through fiscal have also been denominated in yen 
the company has periodically hedged its net exposure to fluctuations in the yen to us dollar exchange rates through the use of forward exchange or option contracts 
however  beginning in fiscal  most wafers purchased from japanese suppliers will be denominated in us dollars 
the company also intends to begin invoicing japanese customers in us dollars during the second half of fiscal for a period of time  wafers will be purchased in us dollars and invoicing to japanese customers will continue to be in yen  resulting in a yen exposure 
however  after invoicing begins in us dollars  the company believes that its net yen exposure relating to fluctuations in the yen to us dollar exchange rate should decline  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
as a result  the company plans to adjust its future hedging strategy 
in addition  the company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in fiscal to minimize the impact of future exchange fluctuations relating to its fiscal investment in the usic joint venture  which was denominated in new taiwan dollars 
no currency forward or option contracts were outstanding as of march  the company has several subsidiaries and an equity investment in the usic joint venture whose financial statements are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency financial statements are translated at each month end during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
if permanent changes occur in exchange rates after an investment is made  the investment s value will increase or decrease accordingly 
these fluctuations are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
to date  the usic joint venture has recorded approximately million as cumulative translation adjustments  as the new taiwan dollar has decreased in value against the us dollar 
also  as the company s subsidiaries and the usic joint venture maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
usic s net income to date has resulted largely from favorable foreign currency exchange gains on its us dollar denominated investments
