the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
for the reasons set forth below including the reclassification into assets held for sale of a substantial portion of the company s assets in the third quarter of and related accounting consequences and the inception of two businesses in the company s results of operations and cash flows for and are not comparable to each other or to prior periods 
overview the company is a specialty financial services company 
the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  fourteen hill management  fourteen hill capital  allegiance and allegiance funding 
see notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein for further information regarding these entities 
until february  the company provided viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
see cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets  name change 
subsequently  the company has sought to become a broad based specialty financial services company 
to that end  the company has expanded its financial services business through the formation and investment in other entities  including fourteen hill management  fourteen hill capital  allegiance and allegiance funding 
the company continues to evaluate other strategic business opportunities 
fourteen hill capital and allegiance  whose business activities are described under item business  are indicative of the types of business opportunities the company intends to pursue 
see method of consolidation 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in becoming a broad based specialty financial services company or that any such enterprise will be successful 
point west was formed in september and commenced operations on january  effective september   echelon was merged with and into point west as part of the reorganization 
see footnote to item selected financial data 
the merger had no material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations except for the effect on per share calculations 
cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets  name change the principal business activity of the company through february was to provide viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
a viatical settlement is the payment of cash in return for an ownership interest in  and right to receive the death benefit face value from  a life insurance policy 
on july   the company announced that  in light of the data regarding new treatments involving combinations of various drugs presented at the aids conference  the company was temporarily ceasing processing new applications for policies insuring individuals afflicted with aids and hiv while it further analyzed the effects of such research results on its business and its strategic options 
further analysis resulted in the company s concluding that the efficacy of the treatments reported at the aids conference and subsequently reported treatments had increased the risks of purchasing and holding policies insuring the lives of individuals diagnosed with hiv and aids 
the company decided in the third quarter of to sell all or substantially all of its assets 
as a result of such decision  the company reclassified all of its assets other than the policies held by dpfc to a held for sale category during the third quarter of accordingly  such assets are accounted for on the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company cannot predict what further impact the foregoing may have on its business  prospects  results of operations or financial position 
the company sought and received in december stockholder approval to sell all or substantially all of its assets 
based on the company s evaluation of the effects of the research results reported at the aids conference and subsequent reports and other information  the company believed that it had become extremely difficult to predict accurately life expectancy of people afflicted with hiv and aids 
further  the company decided that it was not viable to continue to operate a viatical settlement business solely for non aids policies while a market for non aids policies develops  if it developed at all 
as a result  the board in february approved the cessation of the viatical settlement business and the sale by the company of its non aids policies 
through december   the company entered into agreements to sell approximately policies with an aggregate purchase price of million  representing million in aggregate face value 
through such date  the company consummated the sale of policies for million  representing million in aggregate face value 
the company reported a pre tax loss of  in and a pre tax gain of million in in connection with such sales 
see year ended december  compared to year ended december  gain loss on assets sold and year ended december  compared to year ended december  gain loss on assets sold 
the company has experienced delays or difficulties in transferring the ownership of policies with an aggregate face value of  at december  the company continues to pursue other options for the sale of these policies  however  due to the limited market the company reevaluated the fair value of these policies and recorded in the third quarter of an additional reserve of  for these assets 
the fair value is based on management s best estimate in light of the limited market and the prices received by the company in connection with its other sales 
as of december  the carrying value of these policies was  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also continues to hold  through dpfc  a substantial amount of policies  which at december  totaled policies with a face value of million and a carrying value of million 
because the company no longer engages in the viatical settlement business  the board determined that a change in the company s name was appropriate 
the company sought and received in june stockholder approval to amend point west s certificate of incorporation to change its name from dignity partners  inc to point west capital corporation 
the name change was effective august  method of accounting through june   the company recognized income earned discount on each purchased policy by accruing  over the period between the acquisition date of the policy and the company s estimated date of collection of the policy s face value the accrual period  the difference the unearned discount between a the face value of the policy less the amount of fees  if any  payable to a referral source upon collection of the face value  and b the carrying value of the policy 
through june   the carrying value for each policy was reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet under purchased life insurance policies and consisted of the purchase price  other capitalized costs and the earned discount on the policy accrued to the balance sheet date 
the company capitalized as incurred the following costs of a purchased policy i the purchase price paid for the policy  ii policy premiums  if any  paid by the company  iii amounts  if any  paid to referral sources upon acquisition of the policy and iv amounts paid to company retained physicians or other medical consultants consultants who estimated the insured s life expectancy 
the carrying value of a policy changed over time  and was adjusted quarterly to reflect earned discounts accrued on the policy  amounts paid for any additional future increases in coverage  any additional premium payments and any premium refunds if the policy becomes covered by premium waiver provisions 
the length of the accrual period was determined by the company based upon its estimate of the date on which it would collect the face value of the policy 
such estimate was based upon the company s estimate of the life expectancy of the insured  after review of the medical records of the insured by one or more consultants  and was also adjusted to reflect the historical accuracy of the life expectancies estimated by the consultants and the typical period between the date of an insured s death and the date on which the company collects the face value of the policy 
the unearned discount was accrued over the accrual period using the level yield interest method 
under the level yield method  the yield was held constant such that when the yield was applied to the carrying value of the policy on a compounded basis over the course of the accrual period  the unearned discount was fully accrued as earned discount by the end of the accrual period 
as a result of the company s decision to sell all or substantially all of its assets  the company established a reserve for loss on sale of assets during the quarter ended september  and reevaluates this reserve quarterly 
an additional reserve of  was recorded in the third quarter of the company also established a reserve for loss of point west s equity interest in dpfc during the third quarter of because of the uncertainties created by the data presented at the aids conference and subsequent reports of the efficacy of new treatments for aids hiv 
the reserve for loss on sale of assets was  and million as of december  and  respectively 
the reserve for loss of point west s equity interest in dpfc was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  beginning in the third quarter of  the company began generally recognizing income with respect to its viatical settlement business upon receipt of proceeds on policies either pursuant to sale of the policy or the death of the insured 
such income is equal to the difference between such proceeds less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of such policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on the sale of such policies 
see notes e and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the reserve for loss on sale of assets

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for loans advanced by fourteen hill capital and allegiance by accruing interest on outstanding balances 
since there were only a few loans outstanding at december   the company evaluated the loans and determined that a specific reserve was not necessary 
as the loan portfolios grow  general reserves will be added to the extent considered necessary 
method of consolidation dpfc the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  point west s wholly owned subsidiary through which the company issued the securitized notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dpfc has purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million and will not purchase any more policies 
the carrying value of the policies held by dpfc was million at december  dignity viatical and dignified one dignity viatical was a limited partnership formed in to fund purchases of life insurance policies 
point west served as the sole general partner  and persons not affiliated with the company were limited partners 
because point west controlled dignity viatical  the assets  liabilities and operations of dignity viatical were consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements from to june  the minority interest of former limited partners in investment partnership reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements represents the limited partners interests in the net assets and income of dignity viatical 
through june  dignity viatical had purchased policies with an aggregate face value of million 
on june   point west purchased the limited partnership interests in dignity viatical and became the sole owner of all of the partnership interests therein 
on august   the company entered into an agreement to sell to an unaffiliated third party virtually all of the policies owned by dignity viatical representing million in face value 
the cash proceeds of such sale in approximately million have been collected by the company 
see notes lc and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dignified one was a limited partnership formed in to fund purchases of life insurance policies 
dignified one purchased policies  with an aggregate face value of million 
all policies held by dignified one were collected or sold by september due to its immateriality  dignified one has been treated as an investment for accounting purposes 
therefore  the policies purchased by dignified one are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements or in the company s operating or selected financial data presented herein 
fourteen hill management and fourteen hill capital the company also consolidates the assets  liabilities and operations of fourteen hill management and fourteen hill capital 
fourteen hill management is a wholly owned limited liability company of point west formed on june  solely for the purpose of serving as the general partner of one or more sbic s 
fourteen hill capital is a limited partnership formed on june  solely for the purpose of operating as an sbic 
fourteen hill management is the sole general partner of fourteen hill capital  and owns of the partnership interests 
point west is one of the two limited partners of fourteen hill capital and owns a of the partnership interests 
the remaining of the partnership interest is owned by one unaffiliated limited partner 
point west capitalized fourteen hill management with million 
fourteen hill management has committed million of capital to this partnership  and through december   had invested million in fourteen hill capital 
fourteen hill management receives a management fee for its services on behalf of fourteen hill capital 
see notes d   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding fourteen hill management and fourteen hill capital 
allegiance and allegiance funding allegiance is a limited liability company formed on september  as a specialty finance company to provide senior secured loans to funeral home and cemetery owners 
point west has a equity interest and voting control in allegiance and serves as the managing member of allegiance 
allegiance s president and its vice president of marketing  each of whom was hired in september  have the balance of such interests 
allegiance owns of allegiance funding  which is a special purpose subsidiary formed to facilitate the potential securitization of loans consummated by allegiance 
net profits of allegiance for each calendar year will be allocated first to point west in an amount equal to a return of per annum  compounded monthly  on the amount of its capital contribution  but not in excess of such net profits 
any shortfall will be carried forward indefinitely to the next calendar year or years in which net profits are sufficient to make such allocation 
an additional return for each calendar year will be allocated first to point west to the extent that in each year sufficient profits are available with no carry forward provided 
because the company controls of the voting power of allegiance  the assets  liabilities and operations of allegiance and allegiance funding are consolidated with the assets  liabilities and operations of the company 
through december   point west had invested million in allegiance 
see notes d  and b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding allegiance 
certain accounting implications for dpfc although the securitized notes had an expected life of years when the aggregate maximum principal amount of the securitized notes was increased from million to million in september  the securitized notes were not retired through collections by october in the event that the collection experience for dpfc policies is substantially delayed  the equity of dpfc may become negative 
because of recent delays and variability in collections  the company cannot currently predict at what point in time  if ever  the equity of dpfc may become negative 
additionally  if the collection experience for the dpfc policies is substantially delayed  the value of the equity of dpfc may erode further for some of the following reasons 
first  a decision to discontinue paying premiums on some policies may be made because the present value of the expected death benefit on some policies may be less than expected future premiums to be paid on such policies 
second  the face value of certain policies especially group term may begin to decrease as the people whose lives are insured thereunder reach specified age levels often 
finally  policies for which the insurance was continued under a disability provision may be uneconomical to convert given the insured s age and life expectancy if such insured person is no longer considered disabled 
the company cannot determine at present the extent to which policies held by dpfc will be so affected 
in light of the foregoing  the company believes that to the extent that the losses of dpfc exceed its equity creating a deficit  the deficit would be recorded by the company as a loss 
upon the retirement of the securitized notes at less than book value  the company would recognize a gain for the difference which is expected to approximate the deficit of dpfc 
at december   the equity of dpfc was million 
the securitized notes represent the obligations solely of dpfc 
the company did not guarantee repayment of the securitized notes and is not required to fund any principal or interest deficiencies thereunder 
share repurchase program in october  the board approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which the company was authorized to purchase from time to time up to million shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
in june  such authority was increased to million shares of common stock

consequently  the company did not recognize any earned discounts on life insurance policies during the year ended december   but instead recognized  of earned discounts on matured policies for the year ended december  such income is equal to the difference between the proceeds the company received on the policies less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of such policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on sale of such policies 
see method of accounting 
in the first six months of the company recognized earned discount on each purchased policy by accruing  over the accrual period  the difference between a the face value of the policy less the amount of fees  if any  payable to a referral source upon collection of the face value  and b the carrying value of the policy

prior to the amortization date  proceeds from collected policies pledged under the indenture were available to purchase additional policies 
repayments of principal were originally scheduled to begin in september an early amortization event occurred in june with the result that the maximum lending commitment was reduced to the then outstanding balance million from million  the company lost the ability to use proceeds of policy collections to acquire additional policies and principal repayments on the securitized notes began in july the securitized notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 
the principal amount of the securitized notes to be repaid in any month is equal to proceeds of policies collected during the preceding month less certain required monthly payments such as interest and servicing and trustee fees to be paid on such date 
although the company and the noteholders have had discussions about the possible sale of policies pledged under the indenture  the indenture does not provide for the sale of any of the policies pledged thereunder 
therefore  any such sale would require the consent of the company and the noteholders 
the ownership interest in policies purchased by dpfc is nominally held by an unaffiliated third party trustee under the indenture but the policies are beneficially owned by dpfc 
the company accounts for this securitization as a debt financing and not as a sale of assets  which is in accordance with the accounting literature in effect for bankruptcy remote entities with non recourse debt 
the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc are consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the indenture contains certain covenants restricting the activities of dpfc 
such covenants include provisions which i prohibit dpfc from incurring debt other than trade payables and expense accruals and granting liens unless such action would not cause standard poor s to downgrade or withdraw the rating it assigned to the securitized notes  and ii prohibit dpfc from engaging in any business other than the acquisition  ownership  sale and pledging of the pool of pledged policies the pool and the other trust estate  the issuance and sale of the securitized notes and activities incidental to the foregoing 
in addition  dpfc is required to maintain in an account under the indenture the liquidity account a balance of of the outstanding principal balance of the securitized notes 
subject to certain restrictions  funds in the liquidity account may be used to pay  among other things  servicing and trustee fees  principal and interest and taxes 
events of default under the indenture include i a default in payment of principal or interest on the securitized notes when due  ii a default by dpfc in the performance of any material covenant or a material breach of a representation or warranty of dpfc which is not cured within days  and iii certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency and reorganization involving dpfc 
point west acts as servicer under the indenture pursuant to a contribution  sale and servicing agreement the servicing agreement and receives monthly  pursuant and subject to the terms of the indenture  a fee of  until the earlier to occur of collection of the face value of the last policy in the pool or payment in full of the securitized notes 
point west is required under the servicing agreement to monitor each policy and to cause the collection and remittance to the trustee of the face value of matured policies 
point west pays all expenses related to such monitoring and collection services  including paying premiums and back end fees  and is reimbursed for certain expenses 
all amounts owed to point west pursuant to the monitoring and collecting activities are subject to availability of cash after payment of other priority amounts as provided in the indenture 
the servicing agreement contains certain covenants restricting point west s activities  including i restrictions on mergers  ii provisions related to respecting the separate legal status of dpfc  iii a requirement that no person will own a greater percentage of the aggregate voting power of equity securities of point west entitled to vote in the election of directors than the percentage collectively beneficially owned by the executive officers and no person other than the executive officers will own more than of such aggregate voting power  iv a requirement that the executive officers constitute a majority of the board  and v a requirement that point west employ at least two of the executive officers or such other personnel reasonably acceptable to the noteholders in their respective current capacities 
an event of default will occur under the servicing agreement if  among other things  i an event of default occurs under the indenture  or ii certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization occur with respect to point west
