during the first quarter of  the currency positions and extensions thereof matured and the company incurred a loss 
the loss  which will be recognized in the first quarter of totals approximately  liquidity and capital resources the company  where feasible  prefers to own the land on which it constructs its cinemas 
in the united states and puerto rico  a variety of factors including land acquisition costs and competition from well established and well financed developers has caused the company to focus on leasehold sites 
however  an ownership oriented approach is being pursued in australia with respect to the company s entertainment center projects see item  business 
these projects will be more capital intensive  have longer lead times and entail greater development risks than the leasing of facilities in established malls 
the entertainment centers will generally consist of a multiplex cinema with complementary retail and restaurant use and convenient parking all constructed on land owned or controlled by the company 
accordingly  such centers are capital intensive at this stage of development 
reading australia has acquired three sites inclusive of a joint venture shopping center site  which the company may develop as entertainment centers  and has agreements relating to two other possible entertainment center sites 
reading australia also has a fifty acre property assemblage in the melbourne area 
the company is considering development options for this site 
however  if capital were required to fund the company s entertainment center or other projects  this site could be sold to fund such projects 
if all of these potential entertainment center projects are developed  reading australia estimates the total development cost of these projects will exceed million over the next two to three years 
the company anticipates that it will invest approximately million during in furtherance of its expansion of an existing theater scheduled to be completed in cinevista has also signed a lease agreement for a new twelve screen cinema  and has a letter of intent relating to an expansion of an existing location 
cinevista s share of the estimated costs of these two projects is approximately million and will be expended in and cinevista may use funds available under its line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein to fund a portion of its theater development costs 
the company is actively seeking sites to develop angelika type theaters throughout the united states and will consider acquiring leasehold or ownership interests in conjunction with such developments 
in addition  the company may from time to time develop theaters which specialize in conventional commercial film product if the company views the markets as attractive 
the company has entered into a lease for a site on which the company plans to build a twelve screen commercial cinema in new jersey 
the theater is presently under development and scheduled to open in late in addition  the company has entered into letters of intent relating to the development of angelika type cinemas with a total of screens in five locations 
the company s share of the development costs of these projects are estimated to total approximately million 
however  with the exception of the one theater under construction  it cannot be assured any of these projects will be completed as leases have not yet been executed 
the cash cost of the company s domestic cinema projects can range from approximately million for a turnkey leased facility to over million for an owned site 
if the company is successful in its efforts to develop all of the projects which it is presently considering  its capital requirements over the next three years will exceed its existing liquid funds and anticipated cash flow 
however  the company believes that additional funding can be realized through  among other things  bank borrowings  sale and lease back transactions and the issuance sale of additional equity either of rei  reading australia or at the project level 
the company presently has liquid funds in excess of its capital commitments 
the following summarizes the major sources and uses of cash funds in each of the three years ended december   and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased  in from  in to  at december  working capital increased  from  at december  to  at december  the principal source of liquid funds in was the  in proceeds from the redemption of the stater preferred stock investment

see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased  in from  in to  at december  working capital increased  from  at december  to  at december  while not necessarily indicative of its results of operations determined under generally accepted accounting principles  cinevista s and the ny angelika s net of minority interest of  operating cash flow income before depreciation and amortization of  contributed to the company s liquid funds in other principal sources of liquid funds in were  in interest and dividend income   in other income   in proceeds from the stock transactions net of  of paid and accrued expenses and inclusive of the proceeds from the redemption of the citadel series b preferred stock  and craig contributions of  to reading international which benefitted the company upon the company s acquisition of ownership in reading international

the stock transactions the stock transactions permitted the company to acquire assets which could be converted into cash or utilized as collateral to raise cash funds necessary to finance the company s theater and real estate development activities and consolidate craig and the company s interest in reading international in order to reduce the complexity of the company s corporate structure 
with the exception of reading international  the non cash assets received in the stock transactions  the stater preferred stock and the preferred stock of citadel the citadel preferred stock were converted into cash in and in the stock transactions  the company received  of cash from citadel 
in return the company issued to citadel   in stated value  shares of the company s series a voting cumulative preferred stock the series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require the company to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of common stock at any time through a date days after the company files its annual report on form k 
the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the appraised value of the citadel assets or million  whichever amount is lower  by 
if the appraised value of the citadel assets is in excess of million  the company will issue common stock at fair market value for such excess up to a total of million in citadel assets 
the company received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of  the citadel preferred stock with a stated value of  and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
the stock transactions were accounted for as a reorganization of related entities requiring that the company reflect the assets received at the lower of the value which they were recorded on the books of the affiliates 
the stock transactions were intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately million 
the estimated tax liabilities associated with the assets received in the stock transactions were  in deferred federal income taxes primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  the company had a gross deferred federal tax asset of  and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount 
upon receipt of the stater preferred stock  the company determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset which had previously been fully reserved  would be realized and the company reduced the tava by  which amount reflects the amount of federal tax loss carryforwards nols which were expected to be utilized net of  in alternative minimum tax amt 
a portion of the reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance   was included in income tax benefit in the company s consolidated statement of operations in and was subsequently reclassified from retained earnings to other capital 
the balance   was credited directly to other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity in the amount which was included in income was equal to the nols which remained available to the company and which existed as of the date of the company s quasi reorganization 
at the time of the company s quasi reorganization  the company also realized a loss relating to the conveyance of certain assets to conrail and charged such loss directly to other capital 
the benefits of nols relating to such charge cannot be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company has no nols which existed at the time of the company s quasi reorganization and therefore  future reductions in the company s tax valuation allowance will be reflected as income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the convertible preferred stock was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the company at december  at its stated value per share  which value management believes approximates market 
the series a preferred stock has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if the company fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing the series a preferred stock  the company also granted the asset put option to citadel  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for common stock 
the company did not allocate any value to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value options and the asset put option is not transferable 
had a value been separately ascribed to the asset put option  the value of such option would have been deducted from the value of the series a preferred stock and included as other capital in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
in addition to the dividend payable on the million of convertible preferred stock  the company has elected to include as a component of preferred stock dividends in its calculation of earnings per common share  a provision which will totaled approximately  in and  in for the amortization of the value of the asset put option based upon a valuation utilizing the black scholes option valuation model 
management believes that the tax gain related to the stater preferred stock recognized by the company was offset by the company s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of the company has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of the company 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to the company s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed property 
although the company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols would apply to the disposition of the assets recovered by the company in the stock transaction  there can be no assurance that the irs would not take a different position 
also  if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company has determined that it will not need to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also does not believe that the failure of any third party suppliers or other parties to remediate year issues could have a material impact upon the company s operations 
effects on inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a material effect upon its existing operations
