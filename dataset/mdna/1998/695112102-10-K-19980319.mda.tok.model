item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in february  pacificare s board of directors approved a change in the company s fiscal year end from september to december this resulted in a transition period from october  to december   which has been audited 
however  for clarity of presentation and comparability  the discussion of results of operations compares the year ended december  to the unaudited twelve months ended december   followed by a comparison of the fiscal year ended september  to the fiscal year ended september  for purposes of the comparison of the year ended december  to the twelve months ended december   the unaudited twelve months ended december  are referred to as the prior year 
on february  the company consummated the fhp acquisition for a total purchase price including transaction costs of billion 
the fhp acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase 
the company s consolidated results of operations include the results of fhp from the date of the fhp acquisition see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with total operating revenue increased percent to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the same period in the prior year 
fhp contributed approximately billion or percent of the increase in revenue 
enrollment gains net of the fhp acquisition in both the government and commercial programs increased revenue by six percent 
premium increases  mainly in the government programs  along with the company s specialty managed care products and services  contributed the remainder of the increase 
total hmo membership increased percent to approximately million members at december   from approximately million members at december   due primarily to the fhp acquisition 
the company acquired approximately million and million commercial and government members  respectively  as part of the fhp acquisition 
commercial premiums increased percent over the prior year with approximately percent of the total increase related to the fhp acquisition 
enrollment gains in the commercial programs  net of acquisition membership  accounted for seven percent  while premium rates remained relatively flat 
excluding the fhp acquisition  the company has experienced a decrease in the rate of membership growth compared to the prior year 
this decrease is partly due to the disposition of the company s florida operations 
additionally  the company has shifted its focus from one of rapid growth to improved profit margins through the use of a more disciplined product pricing strategy 
government premiums increased percent as compared to the twelve months ended december  with percent of the total increase related to the fhp acquisition 
on january   the company received premium rate increases from hcfa averaging over six percent 
government per member premium rates also increased as a result of the company s exit of its medicaid lines of business in certain of the company s markets  which have lower average per member premiums 
these increases were offset slightly by reductions in member paid supplemental premiums in several of the company s markets 
the combined increases in the per member premium rates increased revenue by almost percent as compared to the prior year 
enrollment gains in the government programs  net of acquisition membership  accounted for an additional five percent of the increase in government premiums 
the increase in the commercial medical care ratio includes higher cost fhp provider contracts  increased non capitated physician costs and increased out of area emergency room costs as compared to the prior year 
the government programs medical care ratio for the year ended december  remained flat as compared to the prior year 
this consistency largely reflects the fhp acquisition  which had lower cost provider contracts and generally higher reimbursement for medicare risk membership 
additionally  the wind down of the medicaid business contributed to slight decreases in the government medical care ratio 
these decreases were partially offset by enhanced prescription drug benefits provided to enrollees combined with lower member paid supplemental premiums 
as a percentage of operating revenue  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly as compared to the prior year  excluding the pretax charges for and as discussed below 
the decrease reflects reduced or eliminated fhp marketing  continued administrative savings  including lower than expected staffing and greater than expected efficiencies resulting from the integration of the fhp administrative operations and information systems 
the company recognized pretax charges totaling million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax for the year ended december  and million million or diluted loss per share  net of taxes for the twelve months ended december  the pretax charges included fourth quarter write offs associated with the impairment of goodwill in certain of the company s markets  restructuring charges and certain other charges 
the pretax charges included an impairment of goodwill  a disposition loss restructuring and opm charges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax charge for goodwill and intangible assets which were impaired and no longer recoverable from future operations 
these pretax charges relate to the following markets and products million for the utah hmo  million for the washington health plan  and million primarily for discontinued workers compensation products 
as discussed in the second quarter  utah s operating losses were related to lower than expected premium rate increases coupled with a shift of membership from capitated to non capitated health care providers as a significant health care provider contract switched from capitation to fee for service 
the company agreed to continue this contract to ensure an adequate infrastructure to service the utah membership 
at the same time  the utah information systems migrated to the standard fhp system in anticipation of the conversion of the fhp system into the company s common system 
as a result  increased utilization under the new fee for service contract was not visible until the fourth quarter of when conversion reconciliations discovered significant unpaid claims as well as claims paid inaccurately 
the company expects that economic and competitive conditions in utah will continue to minimize premium increases and will make provider capitation contracting difficult 
because the losses and the cash flow analysis did not support the recoverability of goodwill  the company recorded an impairment charge and announced that it will exit or otherwise dispose of the utah operations 
since its acquisition  the washington market has had a history of operating losses 
while capitated contracts have been implemented  claims payment issues continue as most providers are not able to administer the claims process 
utilization also continues to be higher than expected 
the company determined that goodwill and intangibles were no longer recoverable and recorded an impairment charge in light of the historical and increasing losses in the market and expected future cash flows 
the company owns a subsidiary which provides workers compensation benefits 
in developing its business plan  the company determined that california legislation did not allow workers compensation products to be priced at a competitive rate that would result in the required return on investment 
without a profitable california revenue stream  the remaining business did not support the recoverability of the goodwill and the impairment was recorded 
the company is committed to the successful integration of fhp and as part of that process continually assesses the efficiency of its operations and determines whether duplicative functions or facilities exist 
as a result of that commitment  the company identified opportunities to restructure and streamline operations which resulted in recording a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax 
the restructuring charges include work force reductions  facility consolidation and other related cost accruals 
to improve efficiency and reduce costs  the company experienced a work force reduction 
work force costs of million primarily include employee severance related to involuntary termination programs 
lease terminations of million pretax were associated with the consolidation of administrative and operations office space 
other related charges totaled million  pretax 
cash flows from operations are expected to fund all of the restructuring charges 
the restructuring should be complete by december approximately million million  or diluted loss per share  net of tax of other charges were recorded for contracts for which the anticipated future health care costs exceed the premiums 
approximately million million  or diluted loss per share  net of tax related to pacificare of utah due to the continuing losses anticipated by the plan 
the remaining charge for loss contract accruals pertains to a workers compensation insurance company and an hmo plan 
during  the company decided that its pacificare of florida florida subsidiary would not launch the secure horizons program and withdrew its hcfa application after considering the effects of enhanced state regulation  reduced medicaid reimbursement  and continued losses experienced in the florida market 
the business strategy for florida profitability was based on launching of the company s secure horizons program 
accordingly  the company recognized a million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax charge for the impairment of goodwill and decided to sell its florida operations 
effective june   florida sold the assets of its staff model medical clinics resulting in a pretax loss of million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax 
during  management approved a plan relating for the discontinuation of certain specialty heath care products and services that do not meet the company s strategic and economic return objectives  including a reduction in work force and the establishment of regional customer service centers 
a restructuring charge of million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax was recognized which included employee severance related to an involuntary work force reduction of approximately million  write offs of assets designated for disposition of approximately million  and other related costs of approximately million 
the restructuring was financed by cash flows from operations and actual expenditures did not differ materially from amounts accrued 
in june  a pretax charge was recognized of million million  or diluted loss per share  net of tax for an increase of reserves in anticipation of negotiations relating to potential governmental claims for contracts with opm 
the company s hmo subsidiaries have commercial contracts with opm to provide managed health care services to members under fehbp 
in the normal course of business  opm audits health plans with which it contracts to  among other things  verify that the premiums calculated and charged to opm are established in compliance with the best price community rating guidelines established by opm 
opm typically audits plans once every five or six years and each audit covers the prior five or six year period 
depending on the type of contract the company has with opm  opm will audit one or more health plans at the same time 
opm has notified pacificare of its intent to audit or has recently completed an audit of the majority of the company s health plans 
while the government s initial on site audits are usually followed by a post audit briefing in which the government indicates its preliminary results  final resolution and settlement of the audits have historically taken a minimum of three to five years 
in addition to claims made by the auditors as part of the normal audit process  the opm may also refer their results to the united states department of justice doj for potential legal action under the false claims act 
the doj has the authority to file a claim under the false claims act if it believes that the health plan knowingly overcharged the government or otherwise submitted false documentation or certifications 
in false claim act actions  the government may impose trebled damages and a civil penalty of not less than  nor more than  for each separate alleged false claim 
in november  the company was notified that the audit of the operations of the company s oklahoma hmo subsidiary  had been referred to the doj 
the company is negotiating to settle this matter with the doj 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due primarily to increased borrowings to finance the fhp acquisition 
the majority of the pretax charges the company recorded in the fourth quarter of are not deductible for income tax purposes 
therefore  the company did not record an income tax benefit for most of these charges 
the magnitude of these charges  in conjunction with the inability to record a related income tax benefit  resulted in the company reporting a disproportionately high effective income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate without the effect of the pretax charges was approximately percent  which is an increase over the prior year 
this increase reflects the additional goodwill amortization expense over the prior year related to the fhp acquisition 
for the year ended december  income excluding the pretax charges described above was million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december  income exclusive of the pretax charges was million or diluted earnings per share 
the decrease over the prior year reflects the increase in the commercial medical care ratio  increased amortization expense  the increase in interest expense related to the fhp acquisition and an increase in the shares used to calculate earnings per share 
for the year ended december  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
this statement requires a dual presentation of earnings per share  basic and diluted and restatement of earnings per share for prior years 
the adoption of this statement did not materially change the company s calculation of earnings loss per share for any reported period 
due mainly to the pretax charges in the fourth quarter  and the high effective tax rate which resulted in the company reporting a net loss per share  the convertible preferred stock and stock options or potentially dilutive securities included in the calculation of diluted loss per share in the fourth quarter and for were anti dilutive 
since the potentially dilutive securities were anti dilutive  the calculation of the diluted loss per share is identical to the basic loss per share 
the class a common stock  class b common stock and series a preferred stock issued in conjunction with the fhp acquisition see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements caused a significant increase in the shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share between the fiscal quarters 
due to the significant increase in shares outstanding and the anti dilutive effect of the potentially dilutive securities during the fourth quarter  the sum of the quarterly earnings loss per share does not equal the year to date loss per share 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year total operating revenue increased million to billion for the fiscal year ended september  from billion for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
enrollment gains in both the government and commercial programs  offset slightly by decreases in commercial premium rates  provided an increase in total operating revenue of million 
the remaining operating revenue increase was contributed by the incremental operations of acquisitions described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the company s specialty managed care products and services 
commercial premiums increased million or percent to billion for the fiscal year ended september  from billion in fiscal commercial hmo membership increased by million to million due to continued growth in all markets except florida 
commercial hmo membership growth provided million of the increase  more than offsetting average premium rate decreases of one percent  primarily in california 
the effects of acquisitions described above and the commercial specialty managed care products and services provided the remainder of the increase in commercial premiums 
government premiums rose million or percent to billion for the fiscal year ended september  from billion in fiscal enrollment gains  predominantly in the secure horizons programs  accounted for million or percent of the increase 
the remainder of the premium increase is attributable to incremental acquisitions and premium rate increases averaging four percent 
the increase in the commercial medical care ratio for the fiscal year ended september  was primarily attributable to increased ppo and indemnity costs of the company s specialty managed care products and services combined with higher physician and prescription drug costs in the company s hmos 
exclusive of the company s ppo and indemnity products  the commercial medical care ratio decreased slightly through improved contracting arrangements 
many of the company s newer markets experienced more membership growth than the company as a whole 
however  with provider networks less sophisticated in managed care  these newer markets contributed to a higher medical care ratio 
the more mature commercial markets experienced slightly improved medical care ratios from fiscal year the increase in the medical care ratio for the government programs reflected increased physician and hospital costs on a per member basis due to higher membership growth in areas with higher provider costs combined with lower member supplemental premiums and enhanced benefits to enrollees 
these increased costs are partially offset by january  hcfa premium rate increases 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for fiscal year however  as a percentage of operating revenue  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased by one percent 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the company s reduction of performance based employee incentives due to current fiscal year operating results not meeting anticipated fiscal year targets 
additionally  the company realized the benefit derived from prior investments in the company s infrastructure which have proven adequate to support the growth in membership 
as discussed previously  the company recognized pretax charges for the fiscal year ended september  totaling million million or diluted loss per share  net of tax see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income increased by approximately million compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased cash available for investment purposes at higher interest rates than fiscal year and lower interest expense associated with decreased debt service 
the increased consolidated effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended september  was attributable to the charges for the disposition and goodwill impairment described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  some of which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
income exclusive of the impairment  disposition  restructuring and opm charges described above was million or a percent increase over fiscal year diluted earnings per share before impairment  disposition  restructuring and opm charges  increased percent or to for the fiscal year ended september  the increases reflect membership growth in both the commercial and government programs and lower marketing  general and administrative costs  partially offset by increases in health care service expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has significant short term liquidity with year end cash  equivalents and marketable securities of billion  a percent increase from december  primarily attributable to the fhp acquisition and results of operations 
the company s cash flow requirements for were met by funds provided from operations 
financing activities  including the issuance of common and preferred equity securities  provided funds for the fhp acquisition 
the company issued  shares of class a common stock   shares of class b common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock in connection with the fhp acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities included billion  million and million for acquisitions and million  million and million for property  plant and equipment purchases in  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in  net cash provided by financing activities included billion in borrowings under its billion credit facility 
cash payments of million reduced the credit facility balance to million at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash received from the sale of the talbert stock in substantially offset the capital contributions made to talbert see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash received for the issuance of common stock provided cash in  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
the company issued  shares   shares and  shares of common stock for benefit plans in  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company paid approximately million of preferred stock dividends in in january the company s board of directors approved a plan to repurchase shares of the company s equity instruments 
the company successfully renegotiated terms of the credit facility to increase the maximum amount of repurchases permitted to million 
the company will purchase stock using cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under its credit facility 
shares repurchased will be available for reissuance in connection with the company s employee benefit plans or for other corporate purposes 
as of february   the company had repurchased  shares of its class a common stock and  shares of its class b common stock for an aggregate amount of million 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several pronouncements regarding disclosure that the company will adopt in sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  consolidates the existing guidance relating to an entity s capital structure 
the required capital structure disclosures include liquidation preferences of preferred stock  information about the pertinent rights and privileges of the outstanding equity securities and the redemption amounts of all issues of capital stock that are redeemable at fixed or determinable prices on fixed or determinable dates 
sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a complete set of general purpose financial statements as well as in interim period financial statements 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  significantly changes the way public companies report segment information in annual financial statements and also requires those companies to report selected segment information in interim financial reports 
under statement  public companies will report financial and descriptive information about their operating segments 
operating segments are revenue producing components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and are subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants is expected to issue statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
under the sop  effective in  certain computer software costs are required to be capitalized and amortized to income over the software s estimated useful life 
the company will adopt the sop in disclosure regarding forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements 
the statements contained in this section  and throughout the document  are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements  which statements involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
shareholders are also directed to the other risks discussed in other documents filed by the company with the sec 
forward looking information under the private securities litigation act of membership 
the company s membership for the year ended december  is expected to decline in the commercial program 
in accordance with the company s strategic focus shifting from one of rapid growth to improved margin performance  the company s emphasis is on renewing employer contracts with sufficient price increases to improve gross margin 
specifically  the company has implemented commercial price increases including increases of more than percent in conjunction with open enrollment in all markets  including concentrated efforts in utah and washington which may result in net membership attrition 
in addition to pricing increases  the company has or intends to exit certain geographical areas where the premiums are insufficient to support the cost of health care in that area 
combined with continued increases in competition and the disposition of its utah subsidiary which currently has approximately  commercial members  the company expects to see minimal growth or declines in commercial membership in the rate of increase in government membership is expected to decline in as compared to as competition increases and the company continues the migration of fhp senior members into the company s benefit structures and the combined provider network 
additionally  the government membership will decrease by the approximately  government members serviced by utah when the disposition is complete 
an unforeseen loss of profitable membership could have a material adverse effect on the company 
factors which could contribute to the loss of membership include issues related to the integration of the company and fhp in retaining fhp s members as the company combines the pacificare and fhp health plans  sale of certain managed care operations  failure to obtain new customers or to retain existing customers  effect of premium increases  reductions in workforce by existing customers  adverse publicity and news coverage  inability to carry out marketing and sales plans  or the loss of key executives or key employees 
health care provider contracts 
the company s profitability depends  in part  on its ability to maintain effective control over health care costs while providing members with quality care 
specifically  capitating providers in utah  nevada and washington and recontracting with providers in oregon will be critical to improved results of operations for those markets 
securing cost effective contracts with existing and new physician groups is more difficult due to increased competition 
the negotiation of provider contracts  generally as of january  may be impacted by adverse state and federal legislation and regulation discussed below 
failure to secure cost effective contracts may result in a loss in membership or a higher medical care ratio 
the company s inability to contract with providers  loss of contracts with providers  inability of providers to provide adequate care or insolvency of providers could materially and adversely affect the company 
these contracting and insolvency risks include a loss of membership  incurring additional expenses to meet the requirement to continue to arrange for health care services  among other things  for members  the inability to obtain reimbursement due the company from providers  the expenditure of additional funds to maintain adequate provider networks and assertion of claims by third parties against the company 
the effect of these risks could result in the recognition of a charge in a future period 
commercial medical care ratio 
the commercial medical care ratio for the year ended december  is expected to decrease as compared to the company expects improvements as it continues renegotiation of provider contracts  implements capitated contracts and implements price increases 
price increases on a consolidated company basis are expected to increase by an average of four percent  with increases ranging from zero to over ten percent 
moreover  higher premium rates offered during open enrollment periods should result in the elimination of some high medical care ratio membership 
during  the company will concentrate its efforts on continued renegotiations with providers  including the acquired fhp contracts 
successful renegotiation of these contracts should reduce the medical care ratio 
finally  the disposition of utah  which currently runs a higher than average medical care ratio  should help to improve the commercial medical care ratio 
these improvements are expected to be slightly offset by increased prescription drug costs 
government medical care ratio 
in  the government medical care ratio is expected to remain consistent with that of the company has received notice from hcfa that in it will be receiving premium rate increases ranging from two percent in the company s largest markets to six percent in smaller markets resulting in overall weighted average premium rate increases of a little over two percent 
competitive pressures in the medicare market may require enhanced benefits 
the implementation of medicare reform provisions which curtail program spending and allow the entry of new forms of competitor plans could further increase competitive pressures see legislation and regulation below 
the hcfa rate increases and lower fhp government medical care ratio are expected to be offset by these competitive pressures 
medical care risk factors 
the commercial and government medical care ratio expectations discussed above could be affected by various uncertainties  including increases in medical and prescription drug costs which have been escalating faster than premium increases in recent years  increases in utilization and costs of medical services and the effect of actions by competitors or groups of providers  termination of provider contracts or renegotiation thereof at less cost effective rates or terms of payment  or the inability to complete a timely  successful disposition of the company s utah subsidiary 
in addition  the commercial and government medical care ratio expectations for the hmos acquired in the fhp acquisition could be impacted by the conversion to pacificare computer systems over the next eighteen months which may result in reduced timely visibility of actual claims costs 
marketing  general and administrative support 
in  marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue are expected to decrease slightly from the company expects to experience additional costs associated with the integration of fhp largely related to upgrading and converting information systems to maintain and enhance the company s competitive edge in information technology 
these additional costs are expected to be offset as the company realizes the benefits of restructuring and a full year of synergies as a result of the fhp transaction 
marketing  general and administrative expenses could be adversely impacted by the need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative  or management information systems expenditures and the inability to carry out marketing and sales plans 
the ability of pacificare to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies related to the fhp acquisition is subject to the following additional uncertainties  among others the ability to eliminate duplicative functions while maintaining acceptable performance levels and the possibility that the continued integration will result in a loss of providers  employers  members or key employees 
dispositions 
while the company has previously announced its intention to dispose of its utah and workers compensation operations in  other dispositions could be announced as the company continues to evaluate whether certain subsidiaries or products fit within its core business strategy 
there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in selling all or a portion of the utah or workers compensation operations at a price sufficient to avoid disposition losses 
such losses could include restructuring expenses for severance  lease and contract terminations as well as impairment of long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that the dispositions will not result in additional pretax charges 
the company believes  however  that any disposition operating losses would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position 
however  the disposition losses could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows of a future quarter 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets including goodwill and intangibles on an annual basis or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or the business climate indicate that expected undiscounted future cash flows for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded asset 
based on the annual analysis  certain of the company s operations will require more frequent monitoring in in addition  at december  certain of the company s property  plant and equipment was determined to be recoverable because of long term operating lease agreements 
should there be a change in the rental income stream  an impairment for these assets may be necessary 
the company believes that this impairment would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position 
however  the impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows 
year in  the company developed and began execution of an enterprise wide plan to ensure application and systems compliance for the year the company currently expects the project to be complete by the end of and to cost less than million 
this estimate includes internal costs  but excludes the costs to upgrade and replace systems in the normal course of business 
as of december   approximately million had been expensed related to this project 
an additional component of this project is the written confirmation from all systems vendors ensuring year compliance in conjunction with the company s target deadlines 
the company is currently assessing the impact  if any  of year issues it may encounter with entities with which it electronically interacts  including hcfa 
if hcfa or certain other entities experience significant failures or erroneous applications  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
office of personnel management contingencies 
the company intends to negotiate with opm and doj on all matters to attain a mutually satisfactory result 
while there is no assurance that the negotiations will be concluded satisfactorily or that additional liability will not be incurred  management believes that any ultimate liability in excess of amounts accrued  which could arise upon completion of the audits by opm of the health plans  would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position 
however  such liability could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future quarter if resolved unfavorably see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company s credit facility requires mandatory reductions of the outstanding principal balance beginning january and is required to be paid in full by january  as of december   the outstanding balance on the credit facility would not require a reduction until july  the company believes cash flows from operations  existing cash equivalents  marketable securities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the credit facility and will provide sufficient liquidity for operations in the foreseeable future 
cash flows could be adversely affected because the company is subject to greater operating leverage due to its higher levels of indebtedness as a result of the fhp acquisition 
the company s plan to repurchase shares of outstanding stock may result in the reduction of cash and equivalents or in additional borrowings on its credit facility 
additional borrowings on the credit facility may result in the company being subject to earlier mandatory reduction of its outstanding balance 
additionally  should the credit facility be fully drawn  the company s ability to make a payment on  or repayment of  its future obligations under the credit facility and million of senior notes of fhp assumed by the company will be significantly dependent upon the receipt of funds from the company s subsidiaries 
these subsidiary payments represent fees for management services rendered by the company to the subsidiaries and cash dividends by the subsidiaries to the company 
nearly all of the subsidiaries are subject to hmo regulations or insurance regulations and may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more hmo or insurance regulators 
subsidiaries subject to regulation must meet or exceed various fiscal standards imposed by hmo or insurance regulations  which may from time to time  impact the amount of funds that may be paid by subsidiaries to the company 
additionally  from time to time  the company advances funds  in the form of a loan or capital contribution  to its subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying federal or state financial requirements 
if a federal or state regulator has concerns about the financial position of a subsidiary  as a result of costs being incurred by such subsidiary  a regulator may impose additional financial requirements on the subsidiary which may require additional funding from the company 
legislation and regulation 
the company s success is significantly impacted by federal and state legislation and regulation  including medicare legislation 
almost percent of the company s revenue  and an even greater percentage of its profit  comes from its government programs  the majority of which is medicare risk business 
actual results may differ materially from expected results discussed throughout this document because of adverse state and federal legislation and regulation 
this includes limitations on premium levels  increases in minimum capital and reserves and other financial viability requirements  prohibition or limitation of capitated arrangements or provider financial incentives  benefit mandates including mandatory length of stay and emergency room coverage  many of which are effective in and limitations on the ability to manage care and utilization of any willing provider and direct access laws 
it also includes adverse actions of governmental payors  including unilateral reduction of medicare premiums payable  discontinuance of or limitation on governmentally funded programs and recovery by governmental payors of previously paid amounts  the inability to increase premiums or prospective or retroactive reductions to premium rates for federal employees  adverse regulatory determinations resulting in care or limitations of licensure  and certification or contracts with governmental payors  and consolidation of operations or other efforts to integrate fhp 
on august   president clinton signed into law the balanced budget act of  which enacted numerous revisions to the medicare program 
the law replaces the risk contract program with a new medicare choice program  which is intended to increase medicare enrollment in private health plans 
during  hcfa is expected to promulgate regulations that will allow participation in the medicare choice program by hmos  preferred provider organizations  point of service plans  provider sponsored organizations and fee for service plans and provide for a new medical savings account demonstration project for medicare beneficiaries 
the law also revises the formula used by hcfa to calculate payments to medicare health plans by establishing minimum payment levels and annual increases and limiting the overall rate of payment growth 
further  the law enacts new requirements for risk adjustment  information disclosure  quality measurement and improvement and beneficiary enrollment  among other provisions 
the company believes that any slowdown in the rate of premium growth may be offset by the effect of this new legislation encouraging managed health care for medicare beneficiaries 
the loss of medicare contracts or termination or modification of the hcfa risk based medicare program could have a material adverse effect on the revenue  profitability and business prospects of the company 
additionally  recently adopted federal legislation  among other things  repeals the requirement that at least half of a medicare health plan s enrollment be drawn from commercial contracts the rule beginning january   and gives the department of health and human services broad authority to waive the rule for certain plans beginning january  the company believes that the repeal of the rule will allow it to develop medicare risk programs in markets where it does not have operations through expansion of the secure horizons programs and affiliations between its medicare risk management subsidiary and health plans or providers in such markets 
legal proceedings 
the company has been served with several purported class action suits alleging violations of federal securities laws by the company and by certain of its officers and directors 
the complaints relate to the period from the date of the fhp acquisition through the company s november  announcement that earnings for the fourth quarter of would be lower than expected 
these complaints primarily allege that the company previously omitted and or misrepresented material facts with respect to its costs  earnings and profits 
these suits are at a very early stage and no discovery has occurred 
the company believes it has good defenses to the claims in these suits and is contesting them vigorously 
the company is also involved in legal actions in the normal course of business  some of which seek monetary damages  including claims of punitive damages which are not covered by insurance 
after review  including consultation with counsel  based on current information  management believes any ultimate liability in excess of amounts accrued which would likely arise from these actions including the purported class actions would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  management s evaluation of the likely impact of these actions could change in the future and an unfavorable outcome  depending upon the amount and timing  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows of a future quarter 
other 
results may differ materially from those projected  forecast  estimated and budgeted by the company due to adverse results in ongoing audits or in other reviews conducted by federal or state agencies or health care purchasing cooperatives  adverse results in significant litigation matters  and changes in interest rates causing an increase in interest expense
