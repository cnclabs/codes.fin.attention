the company s current development plans are to open approximately restaurants during  of which seven were opened as of february   and were under construction or development 
during  the company commenced construction on a development plan for a waterfront area in south houston the kemah development 
the kemah development includes up to eight restaurant sites  with additional light retail and hotel motel facilities in a master planned development 
the company currently operates five restaurants in this development  and has not determined which portions of the remaining development it will operate or sublease 
further  the company is evaluating the feasibility of building a multistory office building for the company s corporate headquarters 
due to the company s rapid growth and increasing office needs  the company has experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate office space within the desired immediate area of its existing office 
to this end  in july the company acquired a four acre undeveloped land parcel in houston 
exclusive of any acquisitions or large real estate purchases  the company currently expects to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in l  depending upon the actual timing of construction expenditures  the number of land purchases  the amount of expenditures spent on remodels  and the mix of leased  owned or conversion type locations  and the actual timing and number of restaurants built

moreover  average unit investment costs are dependent upon many factors  including competition for sites  location  construction costs  unit size and the mix of conversions  build to suit  leased and fee owned locations 
the company currently anticipates that it will continue to purchase a portion of its new restaurant locations  which are expected to be more costly than leased locations 
separately  the company may spend up to to million on the kemah development and approximately million on the corporate headquarters development  both of which will be spread over the next several fiscal years 
the company is reviewing its alternative options related to the corporate headquarters development  including the viability of a sale leaseback  an outright sale and other options 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and potential financing sources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s working capital and planned capital expenditures through seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is seasonal in nature  with revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits being lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters due to the company s reduced winter volumes 
the company has and continues to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets and has further noted that the joe s crab shack concept restaurants tend to experience an even greater seasonality and sensitivity to weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
the company anticipates some moderation in revenues from the initial volumes of new units 
impact of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a significant effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
management believes the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in land and construction costs could adversely affect the company s ability to expand
