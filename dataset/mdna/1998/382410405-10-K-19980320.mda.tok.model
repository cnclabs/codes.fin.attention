the dollar impact of this decrease was more than offset by increased gas prices received in in addition  contains a full year of revenues from the pipeline joint venture which contributed  compared to  for the following table reflects the production volumes and pricing information for the periods presented average average production price production price gas mcf   oil bbls   lease operating expense and production taxes were  for compared to  for or  higher due to the addition of the patrick oil and gas properties

disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revisions  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
