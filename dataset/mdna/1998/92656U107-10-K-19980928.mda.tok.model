there are certain important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made above 
these factors include  but are not limited to general performance of the economy  specifically as it affects the advertising industry  entertainment  television  video and broadcast industries  the international economic and political climate which could impact the sale of domestic programming overseas significant changes in video technology in the post production industry and the loss of key personnel 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify portions of its administrative and accounting software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
based on the nature of the company s business  the company anticipates it is not likely to experience material business interruption due to the impact of year compliance on its customers and vendors 
as a result  the company does not anticipate the incremental expenditures to address year compliance will be material to the company s liquidity  financial position or results of operations over the next few years
