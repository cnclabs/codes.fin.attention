the company currently intends to raise additional financing during fiscal in order to fund the company s acquisition program see acquisition under item above and to repay the briggs line and a portion of the witech line 
the company has not yet determined the terms of such financing but such financing would likely include the sale of common stock and or debt securities 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has developed and is implementing a comprehensive year program to assess its software and equipment and to develop and implement plans to remediate any year issues that are uncovered 
this program includes five phases enterprise planning  assessment  inventory  compliance development and post implementation 
oversight of the program is the responsibility of the vice president of technology with progress reported to the other members of the company s executive team 
the enterprise planning phase was completed in may   the assessment phase was completed in august   the inventory phase was completed in april  the compliance development phase is targeted for completion by september  this phase includes remediation of all non compliant components and system testing of all ari supported components 
affected software includes software used by the company for its own internal operations and software that the company has developed for its customers 
affected operating equipment includes the company s computers and other office equipment and infrastructure systems such as hvac  electric supply and telecommunications equipment and services and similar equipment and services of the company s suppliers and customers 
the year program includes plans to either sunset or bring into compliance different computing platforms  ari products  and vendor software products 
the company currently anticipates that any problems resulting from non compliant products will be addressed through a combination of product modifications as part of planned product enhancements and migration of customers to functionally similar products which are year compliant 
surveys have been sent to all material suppliers 
alternatives will be identified for any products or services that will not be compliant by december  as of the date hereof  the company is not aware of any suppliers with year issues that would have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that suppliers actually will be year compliant by january  the company is not aware of any customer with year issues that will have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that customers actually will be year compliant by january  there is a risk that customers may become increasingly resource constrained by year issues and will  therefore  have less resources available for purchasing the company s products and services or implementing the company s products once purchased 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales 
it is also possible that some of the company s customers will fail to remediate their own internal year issues and that such failure will adversely affect the customer and its ability to use and or pay for the company s products and services 
see forward looking statement 
the company is using both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
management estimates that the total cost of the year program will be approximately  included in this estimate is approximately  which management has estimated will be added to its year program costs because of its recent acquisition of powercom this is a preliminary estimate based upon a comparison of the systems and software operated and sold by the company compared to the systems operated and sold by powercom management expects to update this estimate by february  when a more formal review has been completed 
these costs are being funded with cash from operations and with the witech line and the briggs line 
see liquidity and capital resources 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  relating to all phases of the year program 
the company s plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  and other factors 
estimates on the status of completion and the expected completion dates are based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are forward looking statements 
several important factors can cause actual results to materially differ from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to the growth rate of the company s selected market segments  the positioning of the company s products in those segments  variations in demand for and cost of customer services and technical support  customer adoption of internet enabled windows r applications and their willingness to upgrade from dos versions of software  the company s ability to release new software applications and upgrades on a timely basis  the company s ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the company s ability to manage its costs  the company s ability to manage its business in a rapidly changing environment  the company s ability to finance capital investments  and the company s ability to implement its acquisition strategy to increase growth 
projected revenues and  therefore  profitability and cash flows are difficult to estimate because the company s revenues and operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
the primary cause of the variation is attributed to non recurring revenues from software license and customization fees 
license fee revenues are based on contracts signed and product delivered 
non recurring revenues are affected by the time required to close large license fee and development agreements  which cannot be predicted with any certainty due to customer requirements and decision making processes 
recurring revenues are also difficult to estimate 
recurring revenues from maintenance and subscription fees may be estimated based on the number of subscribers to the company s services but will be affected by the renewal ratio  which cannot be determined in advance 
recurring revenues from network traffic fees and transaction fees are difficult to estimate as they are determined by usage 
usage is a function of the number of subscribers and the number of transactions per subscriber 
transactions include product ordering  warranty claim processing  inventory and sales reporting  parts number updates and price updates 
the company cannot materially affect or predict the volume of transactions per customer 
although the company has recently introduced and plans to expand its internet enabled windows portfolio of products  the marketplace is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that a customer will select the company s software and services over that of a competitor 
the environment in which the company competes is characterized by rapid technological changes  dynamic customer demands  and frequent product enhancements and product introductions 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and advertising resources than the company 
the widespread acceptance of the internet may increase the usage of the company s product applications and may change the manner in which the company charges for its services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risks pertaining to interest rate movements and collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company s only long term debt subject to interest rate risk is its lines of credit with witech and briggs 
see liquidity and capital resources 
such long term debt bears interest tied to prevailing market rates 
an increase or decrease of one percent in the prime interest rate would affect the company s pre tax earnings by approximately plus or minus  annualized  based on the outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at july  as a result  the company believes that the market risk relating to interest rate movements is minimal
