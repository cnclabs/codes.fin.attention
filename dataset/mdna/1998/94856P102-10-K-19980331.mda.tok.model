adjusted for the building sale discussed above  property operating revenues from core properties increased between years 
this increase was due to both rental rate and reimbursement increases between periods 
property operating expenses increased due primarily to increased utilities  repair and maintenance expenses offset by lower real estate taxes in lower real estate taxes resulted primarily from the successful resolution of disputed property tax assessments 
property operating revenues less property operating expenses from core properties increased  exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense and after adjusting for the building sale discussed above

mortgage interest increased  due to interest costs associated with mortgage indebtedness assumed in connection with the company s and acquisitions 
interest expense on credit facility borrowings decreased  due primarily to a larger percentage of credit facility borrowings being utilized for the company s increased development activity in  resulting in increased interest capitalization as a percentage of total credit facility interest expense in compared to see note to the consolidated financial statements 
company general and administrative expenses increased  or from  in to  in  due primarily to increased personnel and related administrative costs attributable to the company s southeast expansion 
the majority of the increase relates to the additional general and administrative expenses associated with the company s nashville  tennessee and raleigh  north carolina operations  both of which were acquired in the fourth quarter of  and expenses related to the establishment of an office in orlando  florida  which also occurred in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in interest income increased  or from  in to  in of the total increase between years   relates to interest earned on loans to affiliated entities and others with the remaining increase due primarily to increased loan balances on real estate development loans see note to the consolidated financial statements

the company s share of the earnings of the service companies and their subsidiaries increased by  or from  in to  in due primarily to gains on sales of real estate properties  principally land  and increased earnings from partnerships and joint ventures  also principally due to gains from land sales 
apart from these gains  net earnings from the operations of the service companies was comparable between years 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year to year comparisons of property operating revenues and expenses for and are discussed herein using the core properties  development properties and acquisition properties categories discussed above 
however  for purposes of this comparison  development properties reflect properties completed and stabilized  and acquisition properties are properties acquired  subsequent to january  property operating revenues increased  or in of this increase    and  were attributable to acquisition  development and core properties  respectively 
the increases from acquisition and development properties were due to the acquisition of properties in and in totaling  square feet  excluding properties totaling  square feet acquired on december   and the stabilization of development properties seven in and eight in and two property expansions one each year totaling  square feet 
property operating expenses increased  or between years  due primarily to the growth in the property portfolio resulting from the acquisition and development properties discussed above

this was due in part to re leasing two buildings totaling  square feet vacated in early  re leasing these two buildings produced a property operating revenue increase of  in the positive impact of re leasing these buildings was offset by decreased average occupancy in six other buildings totaling  square feet which resulted in decreased property operating revenues of  exclusive of these occupancy related impacts  core property operating revenues increased between years due primarily to rental rate increases 
property operating expenses increased due to both increased operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization in net of the impact of the eight buildings affected by occupancy changes  property operating expenses increased by excluding depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in property operating and maintenance expenses reflects increased property maintenance and security expenses between years 
excluding the impact of the eight buildings affected by occupancy changes  property operating revenues less property operating expenses from core properties  increased  exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense between years 
interest expense increased  or from  in to  in  due to higher interest on credit facility borrowings and higher mortgage interest in higher weighted average credit facility borrowings in compared to  due to the company s acquisition and development activity  resulted in increased credit facility interest costs in of  mortgage interest increased  due to interest costs associated with mortgage indebtedness assumed in connection with the company s and acquisitions

company general and administrative expenses increased by  or from  in to  in  due primarily to increased personnel and related administrative costs attributable to the company s growth and to a lesser extent by a shift in certain expenses relating to properties which were fee managed by the service companies in  but which were subsequently acquired and owned by the company in a portion of the increased expenses in also relates to establishing of an office in orlando  florida and the general and administrative expenses associated with the company s acquired nashville  tennessee operations  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in general and administrative expenses of the company  when combined with the general and administrative expenses of the service companies increased  or from  in to  in for the reasons discussed above 
as a percentage of the combined revenues of the company and the service companies  the combined general and administrative expenses of the company and the service companies decreased from in to in interest income for the year ended december   consists primarily of interest earned under the real estate loan arrangements discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   interest income represented  earned under a short term note arrangement  made in connection with a property acquisition   earned under the real estate loan arrangements discussed above  with the remainder earned on short term cash investments 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities represents the company s economic interest in the earnings of the service companies and their subsidiaries after the elimination of interest expense to the company 
the company s share of the earnings of the service companies and their subsidiaires increased  or from  in to  in this increase was due to increased profitability of both the third party fee construction and landscape businesses in  offset by decreased earnings from the property management fee business due to the company s acquisition in late of properties which were previously fee managed 
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to generate increasing cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities increased or  to  in the increase resulted primarily from a full year of operating income in from buildings acquired and eight development properties and one property expansion stabilized in  and from the partial year operating income from buildings acquired and development properties and two property expansions stabilized in the company s net cash flow from operations is currently sufficient to meet the company s current operational needs and to satisfy the company s current quarterly dividends 
company management believes that operating cash flows will continue to be adequate to fund these requirements in the company operates as and intends to maintain its qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as a reit  the company will generally not be subject to corporate federal income taxes as long as it satisfies certain technical requirements of the code  including the requirement to distribute of its taxable income to its shareholders 
in  the company invested  in property acquisition  development  construction and real estate loan activities 
this compares to  in this increased cash investment activity primarily reflects the impact of increased development and land acquisition activity in financing for the company s property investment activities consisted primarily of  from both common and preferred equity offerings  offset by repayments of credit facility borrowings and retirements of mortgage and other notes payable of  in  compared to  from a common equity offering and  of additional net borrowings in the debt and equity components of the company s on going financing strategy may differ based upon future market conditions 
in  the company increased its available borrowing capacity under its multi bank  unsecured  credit facility from  to  and lowered its borrowing costs from libor plus to libor plus 
the credit facility may be used to  among other things  meet the company s operational obligations and annual reit dividend requirements 
the company currently intends to finance its development  construction and acquisition activities primarily through borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   the company had available capacity under the credit facility of approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility matures on december   and provides for annual extensions through december  in january  the company acquired a  square foot  building property portfolio in miami  florida for approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements  including cash of approximately  funded through credit facility borrowings 
additionally  in february  one of the service companies acquired a one third interest in codina group  inc  for approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements  in cash also from credit facility borrowings  and the company raised net proceeds of approximately  through a  share common stock offering which was used to repay credit facility borrowings 
net of these activities  the company s available capacity under the credit facility would be approximately  the company received corporate preferred stock and unsecured debt ratings from standard poor s  moody s and duff phelps in the ratings achieved will give the company investment grade status for all current unsecured debt and preferred stock offerings 
these ratings will serve to reduce the company s unsecured debt interest costs and preferred stock dividends compared to unrated unsecured debt and preferred stock 
these corporate rating levels are subject to change based on the above agencies continuing assessments of the company s financial strength and operating performance 
any change in rating status could increase or decrease the company s financing costs 
the company believes it currently has adequate liquidity and sources of capital  including available borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility and remaining capacity of  under its  universal shelf registration  to meet its current operational requirements  to fund annual principal requirements under existing mortgage notes payable and to fund its current development and acquisition activity 
it is management s expectation that the company will continue to have access to the additional capital resources necessary to further expand and develop its business and to refinance mortgage notes payable as they begin to mature in these resources include debt and equity financings  in both public and private markets  including the use of the company s available capacity under its current universal shelf registration 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken by the company only as suitable opportunities arise 
such activities are not expected to be undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved 
the company maintains staffing levels sufficient to meet its existing construction and leasing activities 
if market conditions warrant  the company may adjust staffing levels to avoid a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
total consolidated debt amounted to  at december   including credit facility borrowings of  and mortgage notes payable of  of the  of mortgage indebtedness   is fixed rate and  is variable rate 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the company s fixed rate mortgage debt was and on its variable rate mortgage debt was 
the weighted average interest rate under the credit facility  exclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps discussed below  at december   was 
based on the outstanding balance of mortgage notes payable at december   the weighted average interest rates on the mortgage notes with a final maturity in each of the next five years and thereafter were in  in  in  in  in and thereafter 
at december   the company s mortgage debt on its consolidated properties totaled  including credit facility borrowings of  for the company and  for the unconsolidated service companies and their subsidiaries and  of other notes payable on unconsolidated properties  the total debt obligations of the company and its unconsolidated entities was  or of total market capitalization at december  assuming the exchange of all of the common units of the operating partnership for shares of common stock 
based on the closing price of the common stock of on december   and assuming the exchange of all of the common units of the operating partnership for shares of common stock  there would be  shares of common stock outstanding with a total market value of  and  shares of preferred stock outstanding with a total market value of  based on the closing stock price of on december   resulting in total equity value of  as discussed above  the company acquired certain properties in miami  florida in january for approximately  and the service companies acquired a one third interest in a related real estate services company in february for approximately  the company also received net proceeds of approximately  from a february common stock offering 
adjusted for these transactions  the total debt obligations of the company and its unconsolidated entities would have been  or of total market capitalization of  also reflecting the equity value of these transactions  at december  management of interest rate risks the company uses interest rate swap and treasury rate guarantee hedge arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its variable rate indebtedness 
the company has in place interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the company s interest costs on  of variable rate credit facility borrowings 
the weighted average effective interest rate under the fixed swap arrangements is approximately 
if interest rates under the credit facility  in excess of the  discussed above  and under the company s variable rate mortgage debt fluctuated by  interest costs to the company  based on outstanding borrowings at december   would increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis 
in  the company entered into a treasury rate guarantee hedge arrangement to fix its interest costs on an anticipated public debt financing transaction 
this hedge effectively locks in  for the period through march  a seven year treasury rate of approximately on anticipated borrowings of approximately these swap and hedge arrangements serve to decrease the negative impact of increased interest rates on the company s financial results by fixing interest rates on otherwise variable rate debt instruments 
however  due to the decline in interest rates at the end of  these arrangements would require the payment of approximately  at december   if the arrangements were terminated 
under current accounting rules  these potential costs are not recognized currently in the company s financial statements  but instead are reflected as part of interest expense over the life of the related hedged borrowings  causing reported interest costs to be higher than current interest costs on similar unhedged debt securities 
the costs associated with terminated swap and hedge arrangements can result in charges to operations to the extent hedged borrowings are not completed or are no longer outstanding 
current development and acquisition activity at year end  the company had committed development and acquisitions totaling approximately  representing buildings totaling  square feet  exclusive of the  square foot  building miami  florida acquisition  completed in january at a total cost of approximately  in february  the company announced additional committed developments totaling  representing buildings and one property expansion totaling  square feet 
including the developments announced in february and net of two buildings stabilized in totaling  square feet at a total cost of  the company had at february   committed development and acquisitions totaling approximately  representing buildings and one property expansion totaling  square feet 
properties to be acquired as of february   consist of three buildings totaling  square feet with a total expected cost of approximately  development properties as of february   consist of buildings and one building expansion totaling  square feet with a total expected cost of  it is expected that such development and acquisition properties will stabilize or be acquired as detailed below square estimated year buildings feet cost in addition  the company has committed  subject to due diligence procedures  to acquire development land totaling  over various periods ranging up to five years 
it is expected that future development and land acquisition expenditures will be funded primarily through credit facility borrowings  refinanced as required through new debt or equity offerings in both private and public markets  and future acquisitions will be consummated primarily through a combination of cash funded through borrowings under the credit facility  the issuance of common units and the assumption of indebtedness  some of which will also be repaid through borrowings under the credit facility 
the information provided above includes forward looking data about expected property acquisitions or stabilizations that is based on current construction schedules  the status of lease negotiations with potential tenants  the successful completion of due diligence procedures and other relevant factors currently available to the company 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not change or that any change will not affect the accuracy of such forward looking data 
supplemental disclosure of funds from operations the company believes that funds from operations provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the company 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to mean net income loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the company computes funds from operations under the current nareit definition by subtracting from net income the dividends to preferred shareholders before making an adjustment for the non cash items described above 
funds from operations is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the company 
accordingly  management expects that funds from operations will be one of the factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash dividends the company will pay to its shareholders 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities as defined by gaap  which are discussed under liquidity and capital resources above 
additionally  funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash flow needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures and dividends to shareholders  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow  as defined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations presented herein under the nareit guidelines is not necessarily comparable to funds from operations presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  the company s funds from operations is comparable to the funds from operations of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company s calculation of funds from operations follows the guidelines issued by nareit  including the recognition of rental income on the straight line basis consistent with its treatment in the company s statement of operations under gaap 
the straight line rental adjustment increased rental revenues by  and  in and  respectively  and decreased rental revenue by  in in accordance with the nareit guidelines  the company excludes gains or losses on sales of operating previously depreciated real estate assets in calculating funds from operations  but includes gains or losses on sales of undepreciated assets land that are of a recurring nature 
pre tax gains on land sales are included in funds from operations in the amount of   and  in   and  respectively 
in  funds from operations available to common shareholders increased  or to  compared to funds from operations of  in funds from operations for  and  are detailed below in thousands net income available to common shareholders    minority interests    depreciation and amortization    depreciation and amortization unconsolidated entities gain on sale of operating real estate property gain on sale of operating real estate property unconsolidated entities funds from operations available to common shareholders common units fully converted    percentage attributable to common shareholders a funds from operations available to common shareholders    weighted average common shares basic    diluted b    a represents the company s ownership percentage of the operating partnership see note of the consolidated financial statements 
b represents the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding plus the weighted average common units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership outstanding common units are convertible into common stock on a one for one basis and the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options 
weighted average common units outstanding totaled   and  in   and  respectively 
common stock equivalents related to outstanding stock options totaled   and  in   and  respectively see note of the consolidated financial statements 
supplemental information on capital expenditures and leasing costs the following table details the company s capital expenditures and leasing costs for   and in thousands building acquisitions    development and land acquisition activity    non revenue producing building improvements  revenue producing building improvements  tenant improvement and leasing costs on second generation leases    building acquisitions in included two buildings acquired while still under development 
these buildings were not stabilized as of december  reflects aggregate acquisition costs including the settlement of real estate loans of  the assumption of indebtedness of  the issuance of  of common units and other acquisition related payables  net of receivables  of  in  including the assumption of mortgage notes payable of  the issuance of  of common units  the issuance of  of common stock and other acquisition related payables  net of receivables  of  in  and including the assumption of mortgage notes payable of  and the application of notes receivable and deposits of  in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
includes first generation leasing costs on development properties totaling   and  in   and  respectively 
reflects aggregate development and leasing costs  exclusive of the decrease in construction payables of  and  in and  respectively  and the increase in construction payables of  in in  revenue producing building improvements included  in building improvements to convert a  square foot single tenant office building to a multi tenant facility 
by dividing the space for lease to a number of tenants  rather than leasing the entire building to a single tenant  the company believes it has achieved higher rents and has substantially reduced its rollover risk and potential loss due to vacancy 
also in  the company invested approximately  in building improvements to convert a  square foot bulk warehouse building to a manufacturing facility 
the new tenant also invested a similar amount in improvements to the building 
management believes that this combined investment has enhanced the value of the building and that the company has achieved higher rent as a result of the renovation and conversion of this building 
includes second generation leasing costs totaling   and  in   and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  earnings per share  was issued prescribing a new method for computing earnings per share  which superseded accounting principles board opinion  earnings per share  the prior accounting literature utilized in computing earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas became effective for the company during the fourth quarter and year ended december  under sfas  the company has presented both basic and diluted earnings per share in its consolidated financial statements and  as required under sfas  all prior period earnings per share data was restated 
the impact of sfas on the company s consolidated earnings per share amounts and additional disclosures required by sfas for  and are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  sfas  reporting comprehensive income  was issued establishing new standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements 
sfas will be effective for the company beginning with the fourth quarter and year ended december  the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statement presentation 
in june  sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued prescribing new guidelines for the reporting of segment data 
sfas will apply to all public  for profit companies and will be effective for the company beginning with the fourth quarter and year ended december  the company was not subject to segment reporting under prior accounting standards  but will be required to provide certain segment disclosures under sfas the company has not yet determined the specific nature and magnitude of the disclosures requried by sfas impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than seven years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals if rents under the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals 
other matters the company is currently assessing the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s hardware and software information systems 
the year issue is the result of many computer programs recognizing a date ending with as the year rather than the year  causing potential system failures or miscalculations which could result in disruptions of normal business operations 
the company s primary financial and operating systems are supplied by third party suppliers 
based on communications with third party suppliers  evaluations of third party systems and internal assessments of in house information systems  the costs of addressing potential year issues are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
in fact  most of the company s software systems are either currently year compliant or will be compliant well in advance of january  however  such conclusions are based upon communications  evaluations and assessments to date and if future negative events occur which can not be resolved in a timely manner  it could result in material financial risk to the company 
the company plans to allocate the time and resources necessary to timely resolve any significant year issues
