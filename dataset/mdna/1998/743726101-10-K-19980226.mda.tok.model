sales in thousands of pounds by division swiss american    royal angelus    comparison of years ended december  and in  sales of  were up from sales of  as the result of increased sales at both divisions 
the meat division s sales were up about in dollars and in pounds and its operating income was up in over swiss s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the th quarter of sales increased proportionately more in dollars than in pounds because of higher selling prices reflecting higher meat prices 
swiss s operating income increased in because of favorable meat purchases and a higher margin product mix throughout the year and increased production labor efficiency and plant utilization resulting from the increased sales volume in the th quarter 
the royal angelus pasta division s sales increased about in dollars and in pounds and its operating income increased in over the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the same quarter of the sales increases in pounds did not result in proportionate increases in dollars because of lower average selling prices caused by price competition and a higher proportion of high volume sales 
the cost of semolina flour increased about in and has remained well above pre levels since then 
royal has been experiencing a tension between high flour prices and increased price competition caused by increasing industry capacity 
flour prices increased slightly in  but royal succeeded in increasing its sales and operating income 
its operating income increased in because of higher production labor efficiency and plant utilization throughout the year  increasing in the th quarter  and because of lower officer payroll 
the company s gross profit for was  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales for gross profit increased absolutely and as a percent of sales because production costs increased less than proportionately to sales  especially in the th quarter  and because of favorable meat purchases and a higher margin product mix at swiss 
distribution  general and administrative expenses for were up about from distribution expense was up about  because swiss s salesmen payroll increased and royal bore the freight on a higher proportion of its sales 
administrative expense was down about  primarily due to a decrease in officer payroll at royal  as well as lower health care costs and consulting services relating to swiss and other outside services  partially offset by higher clerical payroll and bad debt expense 
other income increased about  because of a  state reimbursement of the cost of the removal of a gasoline storage tank at the former distribution division warehouse 
net interest expense decreased principally because of lower borrowing under the bank line of credit 
comparison of years ended december  and in  sales of  were up from sales of  as the result of increased sales at the swiss american meat division 
the meat division s sales were up about in dollars and in pounds in over and swiss had a substantial operating profit in versus a substantial loss in swiss s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the th quarter of sales increased proportionately more in dollars than in pounds because of higher selling prices reflecting higher meat costs 
the increase in sales and profitability at swiss resulted from special pizza chain orders and a reversal of a long term erosion in sales and profitability which began in the royal angelus pasta division s sales decreased about in dollars and in pounds in over  after record annual sales in both dollars and pounds in the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were down in dollars and in pounds over the same quarter of the percent decreases were higher in dollars than in pounds because of a higher proportion of sales of bulk products rather than retail packaged products 
the cost of semolina flour increased about in and has remained up since then  decreasing slightly in but remaining well above pre levels 
this cost increase puts pressure on margins and prices  because if passed on to consumers they might reduce consumption  and if passed on to customers  they might seek a cheaper supplier 
at the same time  increasing industry capacity is causing increased price competition  adversely affecting sales and prices 
the high flour prices and increased price competition caused royal s operating income to be lower in than the company s gross profit for was  or of net sales compared to  or of net sales for gross profit increased absolutely and as a percent of sales because swiss s sales increased but its production costs increased less than proportionate to its sales 
distribution  general and administrative expenses for were down about from distribution expense was up about  or despite increased freight on a increase in sales  because of decreases in swiss s salesmen payroll and sales commissions 
administrative expense was down about  because of lower bad debt expense and collections on doubtful accounts  partially offset by higher clerical payroll  consulting fees relating to swiss and other outside services 
other income decreased about  because a lease of a vacant lot being sublet and a space sharing arrangement at swiss both ended 
net interest expense increased about  because of interest on the term loan used to purchase the nd royal building 
liquidity and capital resources the company has generally satisfied its normal working capital requirements with funds derived from operations and borrowings under its bank line of credit 
at december  the company had no borrowings under its  unsecured bank line of credit with wells fargo bank  na 
the line was renewed in june to expire june   and bears interest at a variable rate of over prime 
the line provides that if a financial covenant is violated  the company agrees to grant the bank a security interest in receivables  inventories and equipment 
the line prohibits mergers  acquisitions  lending  borrowing  guaranteeing  annual capital expenditures over  and new annual lease obligations over  and requires a minimum tangible net worth of  a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of  a minimum debt coverage ratio of  a minimum current ratio of  profitable operations on a cumulative quarterly basis and a zero balance for days during the term 
the company was in compliance with all of the bank s covenants at december  in april  wells fargo bank  na made a year term loan of  to the company to purchase the nd royal building  secured by the building  and bearing interest at over the bank s libor rate 
in  the company made a  voluntary pre payment of the term loan  leaving a  balance at december   including the  current portion 
the loan is payable in monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest  which would leave a  principal balance payable at the end of the term 
the pasta division occupies of the building and is leased to a tenant 
the company s pasta plant in chino  california  after the addition of a third short goods line in  has a theoretical production capacity estimated at  pounds per year compared to about  pounds sold in the plant has the capacity to fulfil the foreseeable needs of the pasta division with adequate space for expansion 
swiss american sausage division s san francisco meat processing plant has a theoretical production capacity estimated at  pounds per year  compared to about  pounds sold in the meat plant s present capacity is adequate for the currently contemplated needs of the division  but the plant does not have space to increase its capacity or the variety of meat products which can be produced 
the lease of the main production building expires in and in the company intends to move the meat plant to a newly constructed approximately  square foot building  to result in a more efficient and higher production capacity plant  with the capability of expansion to increase capacity or product variety 
accomplishing the move requires locating and acquiring a suitable site  constructing and equipping the building  moving from the present facilities to the new plant  obtaining financing for all of the foregoing  and obtaining the consent of wells fargo bank  na to proceed with the transaction or finding a lender to replace wells fargo bank  na as line of credit and term lender  all of which remain to be done 
the estimated cost of the new plant is in excess of  and the company has applied for the issuance of industrial development bonds for all or part of the financing with conventional financing for all or any part not covered by industrial development bonds 
the annual cost to swiss of the new plant will exceed the annual cost of its two current buildings 
the move to the new plant will require charging to expense the net capitalized leasehold improvements at the present facilities and the future rent on the nd building through lease expiration in  reduced by future rent under any agreed sublease  or reduced to termination costs if there is an agreed early termination of the lease 
additions to property and equipment of about  are anticipated for  plus the cost of a new meat plant 
in cash increased about  operating activities produced about  primarily from earnings  depreciation  a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued liabilities

in cash decreased about  operating activities produced about  principally from earnings and depreciation offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
investing activities used about  for net capital expenditures and financing activities used about  for dividends offset by net stock proceeds 
the company s inventories and accounts receivable normally reflect the level of its sales  and in sales were up  resulting in about a  increase in accounts receivable and about a  increase in inventories  following about a  reduction in inventories in on reduced sales 
in cash increased about  operating activities produced about  primarily from earnings  depreciation  a decrease in inventories and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities used about  for net capital expenditures and financing activities used about  for dividends offset by net stock proceeds 
company sales decreased during and inventories were reduced by over  the company purchased the nd royal building in  incurring  of long term debt and using about  of cash 
in quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid if the board believes that earnings and cash flow are adequate 
the company adopted an employee stock purchase plan in to provide employees with the incentive of participation in the performance of the company and to retain their services 
under the plan  employees other than officers and directors may authorize weekly payroll deductions which are matched by the company and used monthly to purchase shares from the company at the market price 
the weekly payroll deduction is from to for each participant 
the matching funds are an expense incurred by the company  but the plan results in net cash flow to the company because amounts equal to twice the matching funds are used to purchase shares from the company 
cash flow to the company from the plan was  in and may be as much as  or more in the company believes that its operations and bank line of credit will provide adequate working capital to satisfy the needs of its operations for the foreseeable future  subject to the need to finance a new meat plant 
the company has no long term debt except the  secured by the nd chino building 
all of its other assets  including inventories  accounts receivable  equipment and its original chino pasta plant are unencumbered 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components 
sfas no 
changes some standards for the reporting by public companies of information about operating segments 
information in financial statements of the company for periods beginning after december  will be presented as required by sfas nos 
and  which  in the opinion of management  will not have a material effect on the information presented 
year many computer programs use only the last two digits of a year to store or process dates 
this is the case with the accounting programs used by both divisions of the company 
as a result  the programs may treat dates after as earlier than dates before this could adversely affect routines such as calculating depreciation or aging accounts receivable 
the company has engaged a computer programmer to correct this defect in the company s programs  and the company expects the defect will be corrected without material cost before the year the company s customers  suppliers and service providers may use computer programs with similar defects which  to the extent not corrected  could adversely affect the company s operations  such as the receipt of supplies  services  purchase orders and payments of accounts receivable
