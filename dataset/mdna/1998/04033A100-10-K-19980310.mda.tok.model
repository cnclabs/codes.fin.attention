item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is engaged in the discovery and development of novel  orally administered pharmaceuticals based on signal transduction technology 
ariad s comprehensive and integrated drug discovery platform spans from target identification and validation functional genomics  to structure based drug design and combinatorial chemistry  to medicinal chemistry and pharmacology 
this gene to drug research and development capability forms the basis for multiple business opportunities  each with a diversity of potential products 
ariad is currently focusing its drug discovery efforts on i the development of orally administered drugs to block signal transduction pathways that play a critical role in major diseases such as osteoporosis  immune related diseases and allergy asthma  and ii the development of orally active therapeutic proteins based on a system that controls signal transduction pathways in genetically engineered cells 
these drug discovery efforts are based on validated small molecule drug targets and known therapeutic proteins 
ariad is further building its gene to drug research and development capability by expanding its functional genomics program 
the company employs functional genomics to identify new drug targets for its signal transduction inhibitor program and novel proteins for its orally active therapeutic protein program 
in each area of drug discovery  as well as in functional genomics  the company has entered into a significant strategic alliance with a collaborator to complement its gene and drug discovery technologies or to support its commercialization efforts 
since its inception in  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to its research and development programs 
the company receives no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and substantially all revenue to date has been received in connection with the company s research collaborations 
the company has not been profitable since inception and expects to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of its research and development programs  including the services the company provides to the genomics center pursuant to certain research and administrative services agreements the services agreements  which services are accounted for on a cost reimbursement basis 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  results of operations years ended december   and revenue the company recognized research revenue under collaborative research arrangements and government sponsored grants of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to was due to a  decrease in research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement and government sponsored research grants offset by an increase of  in research revenue recognized under the services agreements with the genomics center 
the increase in research revenue of  in compared to was primarily due to research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement  which increased to  in from  in  the year it commenced 
research revenue for recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement included  for the achievement of the first research milestone 
research revenue resulting from the services agreements with the genomics center is expected to increase over the next three years and research revenue recognized under the hmr osteoporosis agreement is expected to remain substantially equivalent in see liquidity and capital resources 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income increased by  in compared to as a result of higher levels of funds invested offset somewhat by lower yields and decreased by  in compared to primarily as a result of lower levels of funds invested 
operating expenses research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to research services provided to the genomics center under the services agreements and increased expenses in the orally active protein therapy program  including manufacturing process development and other preclinical development costs 
research and development expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to increased research activity in connection with the hmr osteoporosis agreement 
the company expects its research and development expenses to increase substantially over the next three years as a result of research services to be provided to the genomics center as well as increased manufacturing and preclinical development costs associated with its drug candidates and  if such preclinical studies are successful  the subsequent cost of human clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or in compared to primarily due to increased expenses incurred with the formation of and services provided to the genomics center and other administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or in compared to primarily due to savings in insurance and legal expenses 
the company incurred interest expense of  in compared to  in and  in the increase of  in compared to was due to the higher level of long term debt  and the decrease of  in compared to was due to a lower level of long term debt offset somewhat by higher interest rates in operating results the company incurred losses of  in   in and  in  or  
and 
per share  respectively 
the company expects that substantial operating losses will continue for several more years and will increase as a result of services provided to the genomics center and as the company s drug candidates in research  if successfully developed  undergo preclinical studies and clinical trials 
operating losses are likely to fluctuate as a result of differences in the timing and composition of revenue earned and expenses incurred 
at december   the company had available for federal tax reporting purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire commencing in the company also had federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately  that expire commencing in the utilization of both the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is subject to certain limitations under federal tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and investments in property and equipment primarily through the private placement and public offering of its securities  including  most recently  the sale of series b preferred stock to hmr in connection with the formation of the genomics center in march  the increase in june of its long term debt and  commencing in april  the services agreements with the genomics center 
other sources of funds have included sale leaseback and capital lease transactions  interest income  government sponsored research grants and  commencing in november  research revenue under the hmr osteoporosis agreement 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  at december  the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were  to finance the company s operations and working capital requirements   to purchase laboratory equipment and renovate space  including  for use by ariad in conducting research on behalf of the genomics center   to repay long term debt   for net investment in the genomics center and  to acquire intellectual property  including the purchase of patents and pending patent applications and related intellectual property from mitotix  inc in july the primary sources of funds during the year ended december  were  from the issuance of series b preferred stock to hmr   of research funding from the hmr osteoporosis agreement   in additional long term debt   in advances from the genomics center and  from the sale leaseback of laboratory equipment 
in february  the company began renovation of approximately  square feet of previously leased space to provide laboratories and offices for the genomics center and to expand and improve existing chemistry and pharmacology laboratories 
the leasehold improvements were substantially completed in october at an aggregate cost of approximately  in june  the company amended its existing debt agreement with its principal bank and borrowed  the five year bank term note bears interest at prime plus and is repayable in monthly installments of  in september  the company entered into a lease credit agreement with an equipment lessor providing up to  in equipment financing 
the lease agreement is classified as an operating lease and has a term of five years with a lease renewal or purchase option at the end of the term 
at december   the company had  of additional lease credit available through july in march  the company entered into a joint venture with hmr to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic proteins and small molecule drug targets 
the company and hmr agreed to commit  to the establishment of the genomics center and its first five years of operations 
the company and hmr committed to jointly fund  of operating and related costs  and ariad committed to invest up to  in leasehold improvements and equipment for use by ariad in conducting research on behalf of the genomics center 
through december   the company had invested  in leasehold improvements and equipment and funded  in operating and related costs 
hmr has committed to provide ariad with capital adequate to fund ariad s share of such costs through the purchase of up to  of series b preferred stock through the five year period  including an initial investment of  as discussed below 
the company also entered into the services agreements with the genomics center to provide research and administrative services to the genomics center on a cost reimbursement basis 
pursuant to the hmr genomics agreement  on march   hmr purchased  shares of the company s series b preferred stock for  during the period from to  at the company s option  hmr has agreed to make subsequent purchases of up to  of series b preferred stock at purchase prices based on a premium to the market price of the common stock at the time of each subsequent purchase  unless the market price of the common stock exceeds a predetermined ceiling  in which case the purchase price will be equal to the market price the series b price 
should ariad and hmr determine that the genomics center requires funds in excess of those committed  ariad may fund its share of the excess through a loan facility made available by hmr 
funds borrowed by ariad pursuant to such loan facility  if any  will bear interest at a rate of libor plus and are repayable by in cash or series b preferred stock  at the series b price  at the company s option 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with hmr to collaborate on the discovery and development of drugs to treat osteoporosis and related bone diseases  one of the company s signal transduction inhibitor programs 
under the terms of the hmr osteoporosis agreement  hmr made an initial cash payment to the company of  agreed to provide research funding in equal quarterly amounts of  up to an aggregate of  over a five year period and agreed to provide an aggregate of up to  upon the attainment of certain research milestones 
in addition  hmr has established a dedicated research group to collaborate with the company on the discovery of osteoporosis drugs and has agreed to fund all of the preclinical and clinical development costs for products that emerge from the collaboration 
the hmr osteoporosis agreement further provides for the payment of royalties to the company based on product sales 
hmr may elect to terminate the hmr osteoporosis agreement and further payment obligations after november  if certain scientific milestones have not been achieved  whereupon all rights would revert back to the company
