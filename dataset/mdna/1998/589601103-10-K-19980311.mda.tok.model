item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general prior to  the company then known as parallan computer  inc developed and supported high performance network superservers 
during  the company exited its prior business and product line  which had generated substantial losses 
the company fundamentally changed its business in december with the purchase of meridian data  inc mdi 
the total purchase price was million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and included million allocated to in process research and development which was charged to expense on december  since the acquisition  the company has been engaged in the business of developing cd rom software products and selling cd rom networking software both separately and integrated with cd rom network servers 
in order to bring its skills and expertise in networking systems and channel distribution to a larger market  meridian embarked on the development of its first non cd rom networking system in late in february  the company premiered a prototype of its snap server at the demo show 
this represents an entirely new product classification for the company and the marketplace 
the snap server is a protocol independent  plug and play network attached storage nas device targeted for the pc lan environment 
snap server will attempt to provide superior ease of use and installation of any competitive product or competing method for adding storage to pc lan networks 
according to peripheral concepts  inc  an independent market research firm  the market for nas has been estimated to be approximately million in and is projected to grow to billion in while final pricing has not been set  the company anticipates that its snap server will retail for under  there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to the snap server or adapt more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements 
the snap server will require different marketing  sales and distribution strategies than those for the company s current cd rom products 
there can be no assurance that the company s distributors and vars will choose or be able to effectively market this new product  nor that the company will be successful in developing alternate channels of distribution 
nor can there be any assurance that the snap server will be a commercial success 
a failure of the company s distributors and vars to successfully market the company s new products  or the failure to develop new channels of distribution  or the failure to obtain market acceptance for the snap server  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the company generally ships its software and systems within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
meridian currently has no orders for the snap server 
the company s quarterly operating results may also vary significantly depending on other factors  including the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  market acceptance of new products  seasonality  mix of software and systems sales  adoption of new technologies and standards  price and other forms of competition  the cost  quality and availability of third party components used in the company s systems  changes in the company s distribution arrangements  and the inability of the company to accurately monitor end user demand for its products due to the sale of products through distributors and vars 
in  and  identifiable sales to federal governmental agencies accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s product sales  and the company anticipates that such sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
in the event that there is any reduction or deferral in spending by such governmental agencies  the company s quarterly results would be adversely affected 
similarly  if such government agencies reduced their purchases of meridian products in favor of those of its competitors  the company s quarterly results would be adversely affected 
moreover  the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality in the form of higher sales for its products during the quarters ending in september and december and weaker sales during the quarters ending in march and june 
the company s operating results will also be affected by the economic condition of the personal computer industry  which has from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with or in anticipation of a decline in general economic conditions 
the company utilizes standard  off the shelf software  for all phases of its operations  including production  distribution and accounting 
since some of these programs recognize only the last two digits of the year in any date eg for  some software may fail to operate in or if the software is not reprogrammed or replaced the year problem 
the company believes that its suppliers  distributors  and customers also have year problems which could affect the company 
meridian is in the process of developing a plan to determine the impact of the year problem on its operations 
it is not possible  at present  to quantify the overall cost of this work  or the financial effect of the year problem if it is not resolved on a timely basis however  the company believes at present that the cost of addressing the year problem will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
results of operations in late and early  the company made several decisions to address the disappointing cd rom networking systems revenue growth experienced in the last three quarters of late in the fourth quarter of  meridian increased its sales and promotional expenditures and at the end of january significantly reduced system prices due to competitive pressures 
unit shipments did not increase as anticipated  and  as a result  the company s sustained a net operating loss for in february  meridian announced its first  non cd rom networking product  the snap server 
this product is scheduled for commercial release in the second quarter of the company believes that it will be several quarters before it achieves significant revenues from sales of the snap server 
however  meridian expenses related to the completion of the final product and marketing expenses related to the introduction of its snap server will result in the company posting a substantial net operating loss for see risk factors new product development  rapid technological change  potential for product defects  competition  emerging markets  product concentration 
revenues product sales 
meridian s product sales decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to lower prices  and lower unit shipments 
the company lowered prices approximately in january of due to increased price competition in the cd rom networking market and  at the same time  increased promotional spending 
meridian believes that the market for cd rom networking systems has fundamentally changed from one in which customers purchase integrated  high end cd rom servers  to one in which low cost  plug and play cd rom servers  such as meridian s cd net universal line of servers  are in demand 
due to this shift  meridian s sales mix in shifted from its high end enterprise systems to its entry level systems  such as the cd net universal server 
however  due to much lower price points  the impact on the company s overall revenue was insufficient to offset lower high end system sales 
the company does not expect that sales from its low end systems will grow to the extent required to completely offset lower prices of high end systems 
as such  revenues from the sale of meridian s cd rom networking products are anticipated to be less in than in the company s product sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately  due to higher sales in the first quarter of this increase was driven by sales of new software products released throughout and a resulting increase in the company s system sales 
sales for the last nine months of were flat over the comparable period of during this time  the company s revenue mix shifted towards higher software sales and lower system sales 
this was due to increasing price competition on system sales beginning late in the second quarter of and a heavy promotional emphasis on software products by the company throughout the company s sales in were favorably impacted by new software products released in included in the company s sales were approximately  from the sale of two software site licenses 
beginning in the second quarter of  and continuing throughout the remainder of the year  meridian s revenue mix shifted towards higher software content  and lower sales of systems 
the company experienced increased price competition from its largest competitors for its high end system sales 
as this trend continued  meridian s revenue growth slowed  while gross margin increased 
the company s product sales in early consisted primarily of dos based products  some of which had become non competitive 
sales began increasing in the second quarter of  primarily due to the commercial release of the company s windows based cd net plus v and customer response to increased advertising 
approximately of the company s product sales are derived from two tier distribution sales to distributors and vars 
two distributors  ingram micro  inc and techdata corporation  accounted for and  respectively  of meridian s product sales 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

other revenue 
other revenue totaling million in consisted primarily of a non recurring sale of oem software relating to the company s former network superservers product line 
gross margin gross margin decreased from in to in due to the price reduction announced in january  lower software sales  and a shift in the company s system mix to low end systems 
gross margin on product sales  exclusive of amortization of purchased technology  increased from in to in this increase was due to the higher proportion of software sales in the company s revenue mix in relation to systems sales  site licenses  and increased price performance ratios for cd rom drives 
the company s gross margin was in  including amortization of purchased technology of  as a result of the continuing shift in the company s product sales towards systems with lower price points and continued pricing pressures  meridian anticipates that gross margins from its cd rom networking products will decrease in while final pricing has not been established  the company anticipates that its new snap server will generate lower margins than its existing cd rom products

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense in was million  an increase of approximately million over this increase was due to costs incurred in developing meridian s new snap server 
the company anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase as it completes work on the snap server and begins development on its second generation snap server 
research and development expense in was million  an increase of million over this increase was due to higher payroll and overhead expenses  and the amortization of an advance made to a development stage company dsc 
in june of  dsc repaid the advance 
this was recorded as a credit against research and development expense 
also included in the company s research and development expense for was a million charge for the acquisition of technology to be used in the snap server 
this charge was offset by the receipt of the proceeds from the advance 
research and development expense consists of salaries and related expenses incurred in the development of the company s products  as well as expenses related to consultants and prototype material purchased in the development of the company s new products 
for a discussion of certain risks related to research and development  see risk factors rapid technological change  potential for product defects 
in february  the company premiered a prototype of its first non cd rom product  the snap server 
meridian s snap server attempts to provide superior ease of use and installation of any competitive product or competing method for adding storage to pc lan networks 
as such  it must be compatible with all major pc networks operating systems microsoft  novell  and unix and protocols tcp ip  ipx  netbeui  http  etc 
concurrently 
in addition  it must be able to work in mixed network environments with the same ease as in heterogeneous environments 
such compatibility may be difficult  if not impossible to obtain 
failure to achieve such compatibility could have an adverse effect on the market s acceptance of the snap server 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to the snap server or adapt more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements 
meridian s failure to successfully develop and introduce the snap server would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of payroll and related expenses  including commissions  and advertising related expenses 
sales and marketing expense in was million  an increase of million over this increase was primarily due to higher advertising and related expenditures  increased payroll  and expenses related to marketing studies of the nas market 
as a result of planned expenditures related to the introduction of the snap server  the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will increase substantially in the snap server will require a different marketing  sales and distribution strategies than those for the company s current products 
there can be no assurance that the company s distributors and vars will choose or be able to effectively market this new product or to continue to market the company s existing products 
nor can their be any assurance that the company will successfully develop any such new channels 
a failure of the company s distributors and vars to successfully market the company s products  or the failure to develop alternate channels of distribution for the snap server  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing expense was million in  an increase of approximately million  over this increase was due to higher payroll and related expenses  and increased advertising and promotional expenses 
the increase in advertising and promotional expenses was primarily related to the heightened competitive environment which began in early sales and marketing expense was in in the later part of the company expanded its marketing efforts  increased its product introduction expenses  and shifted its advertising from vertical niche periodicals to broad industry publications  such as pc week and lan times

general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related expenses and occupancy expenses 
general and administrative expense was approximately million in and million in both and the increase between and was primarily due to higher payroll expenses and costs incurred with the company s reincorporation in delaware 
general and administrative expense is expected to increase in both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales 
other income and expense interest income and expense 
interest income increased to million in due to twelve months of interest earnings on funds provided by a public offering of the company s common stock in april interest income increased to million in due to a partial year s earnings on the stock proceeds 
interest income was million in due to lower invested balances 
interest income will decrease in the future as the company expends funds for the development and marketing of its snap server and other products 
income taxes the company had no tax liability in due to the net operating loss 
the company s estimated effective tax rate for and was approximately and respectively 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s tax liability results primarily from federal and state alternative minimum taxes  as well as state franchise taxes 
at december   the company has a net operating loss carryforward for us federal and state income tax purposes of approximately and million  respectively  which expire between and the net operating loss carryforward includes approximately million of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of this deduction  when realized  will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction in the income tax provision 
the company has federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately million at december   that expire primarily in through the company s net operating losses  tax deductions and credit carryforwards may be limited by changes in ownership as defined under the internal revenue code 
based on the company s evaluation of the weight of available evidence  it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will be realized and therefore has provided a full deferred income tax valuation allowance at december  capital resources and liquidity meridian s source of liquidity in was from cash and investments available at december  the company s negative cash flow from operations in was principally due to the net operating loss  which included costs related to the development of the snap server  adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization charges  the amortization of advance for research and development arrangements  and an increase in accrued expenses 
these adjustments were partially offset by an increase in inventories 
the company s capital expenditures for were approximately million 
meridian s source of cash flow from operations for was principally net income from operations adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization charges and the amortization of advance for research and development arrangements 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued payroll related expenses 
the company s capital expenditures for were approximately million 
the company s source of cash flow from operations for was principally net income from operations adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization charges 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales  payment of restructuring expenses accrued at december   and a decrease in deferred revenues 
the company s capital expenditures for were approximately million 
also included in cash flows from investing activities in was million for cash released from the restricted escrow account set up as part of the acquisition of mdi 
the company s entry into the nas market will entail the expenditures of substantial funds for the completion of the snap server  implementing a nation wide marketing campaign  and developing distribution channels for the snap server 
these expenditures may be funded by internally generated cash  marketable securities  debt  or additional equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in dilution in the equity ownership of the company s stockholders 
meridian believes that success requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies  or develop products in house which leverage off the company s experience in networking software and server development 
such investment or acquisitions may be funded by internally generated cash  marketable securities  or additional equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in dilution in the equity ownership of the company s stockholders 
at december   meridian s principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and marketable securities totaling million and accounts receivable of million 
the company believes that its current cash and marketable securities  and accounts receivable will satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of
