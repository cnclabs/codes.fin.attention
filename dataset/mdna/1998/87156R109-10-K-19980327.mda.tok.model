the company is utilizing this technology to discover and clone the genes that code for human receptor subtypes associated with specific disorders and is working both independently and together with its collaborative partners to design compounds that can potentially be developed as drugs for treating these disorders 
in addition to conducting several internal programs  the company is currently collaborating with eli lilly and company lilly  merck co  inc merck  novartis pharma ag novartis  the warner lambert company warner lambert and grunenthal gmbh grunenthal on more than twelve separate drug discovery programs covering ten therapeutic areas 
synaptic s human receptor targeted drug design technology is the result of an integrated approach to four life science fields molecular biology  cell biology  pharmacology  and chemistry  including medicinal  combinatorial and computer assisted chemistry 
this technology allows chemists to focus their drug discovery efforts on a specific human receptor subtype target 
the company believes that its technology provides three distinct advantages over the traditional approach to drug discovery in which compounds are screened against animal tissues containing many different receptor subtypes 
first  by having an isolated receptor subtype as a target  chemists are better able to design compounds that interact with only the target of interest and not with other receptors that may be responsible for side effects 
second  the company believes that using human receptor subtypes as drug design targets will substantially reduce the number of problems that often arise during the drug development process as a result of differences in a compound s activity in humans compared to its activity in animal tissues 
third  synaptic believes that its technology may be more cost effective than traditional drug discovery because the company and its collaborative partners can eliminate or redesign compounds that react poorly with human receptor targets prior to initiating the costly activities related to preclinical testing and clinical trials 
synaptic focuses its receptor and drug discovery efforts on members of a receptor superfamily known as g protein coupled receptors 
the company selected this receptor family for two principal reasons 
first  many g protein coupled receptors have been shown to be effective drug targets  as evidenced by the commercial availability of drugs for a wide variety of therapeutic applications that work by means of their interactions with g protein coupled receptors 
second  the g protein coupled receptor superfamily is extremely large and diverse and  based on several estimates  exceeds  receptors  with its members being involved in the mediation of a broad array of physiological functions 
accordingly  the company believes that there are substantial opportunities to use many members of the g protein coupled receptor superfamily as targets for novel drugs 
the company and lilly have been collaborating since to develop drugs for a variety of therapeutic applications 
one of their drug discovery programs  focused on the development of a drug for the treatment of migraine  is in phase ii clinical trials in europe 
two other programs that are the subject of the collaboration  which are focused on the development of drugs for the prophylactic treatment of migraine and for the treatment of depression  are in the late preclinical stage of development 
in addition  two programs that are the subject of the collaboration  which are focused on the development of drugs for the treatment of smoking cessation and obesity  are in the early preclinical stage of development 
the company and merck have been collaborating since on a program focused on the development of a drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph 
this program is in the late preclinical stage of testing 
the company and novartis have been collaborating since on a program focused on the development of a drug for the treatment of obesity 
this program is in the early preclinical stage of development 
in july  the company entered into a collaborative arrangement with warner lambert focused on multiple therapeutic applications  including obesity  diabetes  alzheimer s disease  depression and pain 
finally  in january  the company entered into a collaborative arrangement with grunenthal 
unlike the company s other collaborations which are focused on a single receptor family but which may result in drugs for multiple therapeutic applications  the grunenthal collaboration is focused on the development of drugs for a single therapeutic application pain but may involve multiple receptor families 
three of the company s collaborative partners  lilly  merck and novartis  provide the company with financial support for research 
in addition  as part of its collaboration with the company  warner lambert is required upon the occurrence of certain events to provide the company with financial support for research and  at the company s option  to purchase equity in the company 
each of these four collaborative partners is responsible for all development costs and is required to make payments to the company upon the achievement of certain milestones and to pay royalties to the company based upon net sales of any drugs resulting from its collaboration with the company 
with respect to the grunenthal collaboration  the company and grunenthal are responsible for their own expenses incurred during the research stage of any project undertaken as part of the collaboration but will each be responsible for of all development costs incurred as part of the project with respect to any resulting drug candidates up to the commencement of phase iii clinical trials 
synaptic will retain manufacturing and marketing rights in the united states  canada and mexico with respect to any drug candidates resulting from the collaboration  while grunenthal will retain manufacturing and marketing rights in europe  central america other than mexico and south america with respect to any such candidates 
the two companies will share these rights in all other countries 
with respect to each country in its own territories and in the shared territories in which it desires to market a drug candidate  each of synaptic and grunenthal will be responsible for conducting phase iii clinical trials  if required  for obtaining any necessary regulatory approval and for all associated costs 
in march  the company entered into an option and license agreement the glaxo agreement with glaxo group limited glaxo pursuant to which the company granted glaxo a license under its patent rights  as well as an option to obtain an additional license under its patent rights  relating to certain of the company s technology 
in consideration for the license and option  glaxo paid the company million 
in addition to the million payment  glaxo is required to pay royalties to the company based upon net sales of drugs covered by the license 
an additional payment is required in order for glaxo to exercise the option to obtain the additional license and  if glaxo exercises the option  it is required to pay to the company royalties based upon net sales of drugs covered by such additional license  as well as to make payments to the company upon the achievement of certain milestones 
unlike the agreements with lilly  merck  novartis  warner lambert and grunenthal  the glaxo agreement does not provide for any collaboration between the company and glaxo 
in november  the company received net proceeds of  after deducting offering expenses payable by the company  from an underwritten public offering of its common stock 
certain discussions in this report refer to various phases of preclinical testing and clinical trials 
for a description of such phases  see the footnotes in the table entitled summary of synaptic s receptor and drug discovery programs set forth under receptor and drug discovery programs focus on g protein coupled receptor superfamily 
business strategy synaptic s business strategy is to develop  together with its collaborative partners  a broad array of drugs based upon the company s human receptor targeted drug design technology 
this strategy consists of four principal objectives  the first of which is to aggressively discover and clone g protein coupled receptor genes 
as of march   synaptic had received united states patents relating to eleven of these receptor genes and related drug discovery systems and several united states patent applications relating to the company s receptor gene discoveries were pending 
in addition  several corresponding patents had been issued in other countries and additional corresponding patent applications had been filed in other countries 
the company s second objective is to efficiently discover and design potential drugs through the use of its human receptor targeted drug design technology 
the company and its collaborative partners are using this technology to design  synthesize and optimize compounds for further development 
the company s two approaches to designing and synthesizing compounds include traditional medicinal chemistry and the newer technology of combinatorial chemistry  each of which is supported by the company s expertise in computer assisted molecular modeling 
with both approaches  the company s chemists and pharmacologists use their knowledge of the structures of targeted receptor subtypes to design and synthesize initial chemical structures that are then optimized 
synaptic s chemists are currently involved in six drug discovery programs  three of which are being conducted in collaboration with the company s partners 
the company s partners may select compounds for testing in the company s drug discovery systems from the company s existing libraries of compounds  their own existing libraries of compounds or newly discovered or designed compounds 
the company s third objective is to leverage resources and generate royalty based revenues through collaborations and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies 
towards this objective  the company to date has focused most of its scientific resources on the discovery and design phases of the drug development process and has entered into royalty based collaborations in which its pharmaceutical partners participate in the early phases of the drug development process and assume principal responsibility for preclinical testing  clinical trials and commercialization 
in these types of arrangements  the company s collaborative partners are generally required to provide the company with financial support for research  milestone payments and royalties tied to net sales of any drugs resulting from the collaborations 
by pursuing this objective  synaptic gains access to the expertise and resources of its partners  while simultaneously maintaining relatively low capital requirements 
in addition to these collaborations  the company has licensed certain patent rights to glaxo under the glaxo agreement 
glaxo is conducting the research and development activities relating to the license independently of synaptic and is required to pay synaptic royalties tied to net sales of any drugs covered by the license 
the company s fourth objective is to retain ownership rights to certain products developed through the use of its technology 
the company is seeking to achieve this objective in a variety of manners  including the exploration of and entry into collaborations with pharmaceutical companies in which the company increases its participation in and funding of drug development activities conducted as part of such collaborations 
through such arrangements  the company believes that it may be able to gain access to additional chemistry  in vivo pharmacology  preclinical and clinical expertise  as well as to retain a greater portion of the downstream financial benefits associated with the commercialization of any products resulting from such arrangements 
background the role of receptors in controlling cellular function the human body coordinates its activities through communication among its great variety of cells and tissues 
one of the principal means of communication occurs through chemical signaling  when one cell releases a chemical messenger  called a ligand  which ultimately binds to and activates a protein molecule  called a receptor  on the surface of another cell 
the activation of the receptor on the surface of the receiving cell triggers a cascade of events in which the message received by the receptor is  in turn  transmitted to the interior of the cell  thereby causing some aspect of the behavior of the receiving cell to change 
the nature of this change depends upon a number of factors  including the specific ligand and receptor involved in the communication 
many different kinds of receptors involved in cellular communication exist in the human body 
receptors are first classified into categories  called superfamilies  based upon similarities in their biochemical and structural properties 
there are four principal superfamilies of receptors the g protein coupled receptor superfamily  the receptor protein tyrosine kinase superfamily  the ligand gated ion channel superfamily and the intracellular receptor superfamily 
the receptors included within each superfamily are then subcategorized into groups  called families  based upon the specific ligands with which they interact 
examples of receptor families within the g protein coupled receptor superfamily are the serotonin  adrenergic  neuropeptide y npy and galanin families of receptors 
each member of each family is called a receptor subtype 
historically  it was believed that each family of receptors had only one or two members 
in recent years  however  scientists have discovered that many families of receptors have more than two receptor subtypes 
the number of receptor subtypes within each family of receptors varies  with some families  such as the serotonin family  comprising at least known receptor subtypes  and other families  such as the alpha adrenergic family  comprising at least six known receptor subtypes 
in general  each receptor subtype is distributed differently throughout the body and often controls physiological functions that are different from those controlled by other receptor subtypes within the same family 
by interacting with all of its receptor subtypes that are located throughout the body  a single ligand thus plays a role in numerous physiological functions 
for example  the ligand for adrenergic receptor subtypes  noradrenaline also known as norepinephrine  interacts with at least nine different receptor subtypes six alpha and three beta receptor subtypes  one of which has been shown to contract the muscles surrounding the prostate and another of which has been shown to regulate blood pressure 
in some cases  the same receptor subtype is found in different tissues of the human body 
a compound designed to bind selectively to a receptor subtype for treating a disorder in one tissue could  therefore  potentially cause an adverse side effect in other tissues that contain the same receptor subtype 
the tissue affected by the disorder may  however  have certain other characteristics that can be exploited to guide receptor subtype targeted compounds to that tissue 
receptor based drug therapy the traditional approach many illnesses arise because of abnormalities in intercellular communication  and the concept of receptor based drug therapy was developed to address this problem 
the goal of receptor based drug therapy is to develop drugs that will interact with the receptor believed to be associated with the targeted abnormality  thereby inhibiting or enhancing the cascade of events that is mediated by the receptor 
a number of receptor based drugs have been developed and are currently being used 
in general  however  these drugs do not differentiate among receptor subtypes and  while they may indeed interact with the targeted receptor subtypes  thereby having some therapeutic effect  they may also interact with other receptor subtypes within the same family as the targeted receptor subtypes 
these other receptor subtypes may be associated with other physiological functions  and interactions of these drugs with them often result in undesirable side effects 
in addition  many of these drugs have limited therapeutic utility because they must be used in suboptimal doses in order to minimize these side effects 
the reason that most of these currently available drugs are unable to differentiate among receptor subtypes stems from the fact that they were discovered through traditional drug discovery methods 
the traditional approach to drug discovery involves the screening of compounds against animal tissues containing multiple receptor subtypes to determine their relevant biological activity 
this approach is limited in its ability to yield optimally effective drugs because of inherent limitations in the use of animal tissues to test drugs intended for humans 
first  by using animal tissues containing multiple receptor subtypes  it is usually difficult and often impossible both to measure with precision the effect of a compound on the receptor subtype that is the target of a drug discovery effort and to determine whether the compound is binding to other receptor subtypes in the tissue that are not the intended drug target 
second  due to differences in the receptor systems of various species of animals as compared to humans  there are often significant differences between a drug s activity in animals and the same drug s activity in humans 
in fact  there are several examples of drug development candidate failures in human clinical trials that were due to differences in the properties of such candidates in humans as compared to their properties in the animal tissues that were initially used for drug discovery 
as a consequence  compounds initially tested against animal tissues often do not have the desired effects when they are ultimately administered to humans in clinical trials 
synaptic s human receptor targeted drug design technology synaptic believes that its human receptor targeted drug design technology can overcome the limitations of the traditional approach to drug discovery 
this technology involves three steps i the discovery and cloning of the human genes that code for the targeted receptor subtypes  ii the use of each of these genes to create a cell line that can be used to measure  or assay  the pharmaceutical properties of compounds that bind to the targeted receptor subtype and that are  therefore  candidates for drug development  and iii the design  synthesis and optimization of compounds that are highly selective for the targeted human receptor subtype 
in the first step  the company s molecular biologists employ genetic engineering techniques to clone the gene that codes for the receptor subtype of interest 
in the second step  the company s cell biologists place the gene into a recipient cell which then expresses the human receptor subtype on its surface 
this recipient cell  which expresses a single population of the targeted human receptor subtype and is devoid of all other related receptor subtypes  is then propagated by the company s cell biologists  resulting in the establishment of a cell line 
finally  this cell line is used as a drug discovery system by the company s pharmacologists to evaluate compounds synthesized by the company s or its collaborative partners chemists 
since each of these cell lines expresses a single receptor subtype  it is possible to design compounds with high affinity for the ultimate target of a drug discovery program the appropriate human receptor subtype and low affinity for those subtypes suspected of being associated with side effects 
the company s technology makes it possible not only to clone receptor subtypes previously believed or known to exist  but also to discover and clone receptor subtypes which had previously been undetectable in animal tissues because they were present in concentrations too low to detect using traditional pharmacological techniques 
many of these newly discovered receptor subtypes may provide opportunities for the design of novel drugs 
in addition  the company believes that its ability to access and to use individual cloned human receptor subtypes in its drug design efforts will yield safer and more effective drugs than those currently available 
synaptic further believes that its technology may make the drug development process more predictive and cost effective than the traditional approach because the company and its collaborative partners eliminate or redesign non subtype selective compounds and compounds that react poorly with human targets at an early stage of the process rather than at the costly later stages of preclinical testing and clinical trials 
finally  drugs developed through the use of the company s human receptor targeted drug design technology will be small molecule drugs which offer possibilities of avoiding specialized delivery approaches and which may be delivered orally 
the company also believes that its success in the discovery of receptor subtypes will enable it to further refine the understanding of many disease processes 
there is increasing evidence to suggest that some disorders may actually involve the malfunctioning of any one of a variety of receptor subtypes included within different receptor families 
for example  in the case of obesity  there are pharmacological data indicating that an npy receptor subtype is involved in controlling appetite  while a galanin receptor subtype may be involved in craving for fats in the diet 
as a result  more than one drug could be developed to treat obesity  but such drugs would work through different biological mechanisms by exerting their therapeutic effects by interacting with receptor subtypes belonging to different families 
the company believes that its human receptor targeted drug design technology may make it possible to discover two or more separate drugs that could benefit distinct patient populations whose symptoms for example  obesity  while identical  stem from different physiological disorders and therefore require different treatments 
consequently  it has initiated several programs in which different receptor subtypes are being used as drug targets for the same therapeutic application 
to date  the company has not completed development of any drugs and does not expect that drugs developed by it or its collaborative partners will be commercially available for a number of years 
receptor gene discovery and cloning the company s principal receptor cloning projects to date have focused on four families of receptors within the g protein coupled superfamily of receptors the serotonin  alpha adrenergic  npy and galanin receptor families 
additional projects directed toward other receptor families are ongoing 
the company s collection of cloned genes that code for receptors in the g protein coupled receptor superfamily comprises human genes  as well as genes from various other mammalian species that correspond to the human genes 
these receptor genes include genes that were discovered by the company and genes that were discovered by others about which information is publicly available 
in general  the company seeks to patent those cloned receptor genes and those drug discovery systems that it has discovered or invented 
as of march   the company had received united states patents relating to eleven receptor genes and related drug discovery systems and several united states patent applications relating to the company s receptor gene discoveries were pending 
in addition  several corresponding patents had been issued in other countries and additional corresponding patent applications had been filed in other countries 
there can be no assurance that the company will be awarded patents in respect of any of its pending patent applications 
drug discovery systems once the company clones the gene for a targeted receptor subtype  it places the gene into a recipient cell which then expresses the targeted receptor subtype on its surface 
this cell  which expresses a single population of the targeted human receptor subtype  is then propagated in the laboratory by the company s cell biologists  resulting in the establishment of a cell line 
this cell line  which constitutes a drug discovery system  is used in two different types of assays binding assays and functional assays 
in synaptic s binding assays  the company s pharmacologists measure the affinity of a compound for both the receptor subtype that is the target of a particular drug discovery program and the other receptor subtypes that could be associated with side effects 
these measurements help to predict the potency of a compound  as well as the degree of selectivity that the compound has for the targeted receptor subtype over other receptor subtypes 
the data obtained from binding assays enable the chemists to design compounds toward or away from one or more of the relevant subtypes  as appropriate  for optimal therapeutic efficacy 
in synaptic s functional assays  the company s pharmacologists determine the nature of the response of the receptor subtype to the compound 
data from the functional assays show whether the compound is acting to inhibit or enhance the activity of the receptor subtype 
by enabling the company s pharmacologists to evaluate compounds rapidly at their ultimate human receptor subtype targets  the company s proprietary drug discovery systems serve as tools that the company s and its partners or licensees chemists can use to rationally design drugs that will be more effective and have fewer or substantially less severe side effects than existing drugs 
although the company believes that its drug discovery systems accurately measure the properties of a compound s interaction with the human receptor subtypes  there are many additional factors  such as the drug s stability in the body or its ability to be administered orally  that impact the ultimate pharmaceutical success of a compound 
chemistry and molecular pharmacology the company employs two approaches to designing and synthesizing receptor subtype selective compounds  traditional medicinal chemistry and the newer technology of combinatorial chemistry  both of which are supported by the company s expertise in computer assisted molecular modeling 
with both approaches  the company s chemists and pharmacologists use their knowledge of the structures of the targeted receptor subtypes and known compounds to design and synthesize structures that will have activity at these subtypes 
combinatorial chemistry involves automated synthesis of a variety of novel compounds by assembling them using different combinations of chemical building blocks 
the use of combinatorial chemistry greatly accelerates the process of generating compounds 
the resulting arrays of compounds are called libraries and are used to screen for compounds lead compounds that demonstrate a sufficient level of activity at receptors of interest 
the company is using combinatorial chemistry to synthesize focused libraries of compounds anticipated to be highly biased toward the company s drug discovery targets 
the company s scientists have successfully generated lead compounds through the use of these combinatorial chemistry techniques 
once lead compounds are identified  whether through the use of combinatorial chemistry or traditional medicinal chemistry  a variety of analogues are prepared to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity 
these studies help define structure activity relationships which can then be used to design drug candidates with improved potency  selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties 
combinatorial chemistry is used to rapidly generate a variety of structures for lead optimization 
traditional medicinal chemistry  which involves the synthesis of compounds one at a time  is also used for further refinement and to generate compounds not accessible by automated techniques 
receptor and drug discovery programs focus on g protein coupled receptor superfamily the superfamily of receptors to which the company has chosen to apply its human receptor targeted drug design technology is the g protein coupled receptor superfamily  so called because the cascade of events that ensues within the receiving cell following the occurrence of the ligand receptor interaction is mediated by a class of proteins called gtp binding regulatory proteins  or g proteins  found within the cell 
the company chose to focus on the g protein coupled receptor superfamily because it believes that this superfamily provides the optimum opportunity for the exploitation of its human receptor targeted drug design technology 
first  it is known that g protein coupled receptors play a major role in intercellular communication and that drugs that block antagonists or enhance agonists their activity have therapeutic utility 
examples of such drugs include zantac r  a histamine receptor antagonist for the treatment of ulcers  claritin r  a histamine receptor antagonist for the treatment of allergy  propulsid r  a serotonin receptor agonist for the treatment of gastric motility disorder  imitrex r  a serotonin receptor agonist for the treatment of migraine headache  and hytrin r  an adrenergic receptor antagonist for the treatment of hypertension and bph 
second  there is a large body of knowledge about some of the basic structural elements of drugs that interact with these receptors that has accumulated over the years from which the company and its collaborative partners can draw in beginning their drug discovery programs 
third  the g protein coupled receptor superfamily is extremely large and  based on several estimates  exceeds  receptor subtypes belonging to more than known families and an unknown number of additional families the ligands of which have not yet been identified 
to the company s knowledge  fewer than half of the genes that code for these subtypes have been cloned 
the company s primary drug discovery programs are focused on human serotonin  adrenergic  npy and galanin receptor subtypes 
the serotonin programs are being conducted by the company in collaboration with lilly 
one of the alpha adrenergic programs is being conducted by the company in collaboration with merck and the other alpha adrenergic program is being conducted by the company in collaboration with grunenthal 
of the company s three npy programs  one is being conducted by the company in collaboration with novartis and two are being conducted by the company independently 
the galanin program is being conducted by the company in collaboration with warner lambert 
total operating expenses incurred by the company for each of the fiscal years  and were   and  respectively  of which approximately   and  respectively  was funded by the company s collaborative partners 
in  following the completion of its initial public offering in december  the company increased its internal research and development spending 
the company again increased internal research and development spending during and the company intends to further increase such spending during certain of the company s receptor and drug discovery programs are summarized in the following table summary of synaptic s receptor and drug discovery programs program receptor s primary indication s status partner serotonin f acute migraine phase ii clinical eli lilly b migraine prophylaxis late preclinical eli lilly depression late preclinical eli lilly a smoking cessation early preclinical eli lilly c obesity early preclinical eli lilly alpha adrenergic a benign prostatic hyperplasia late preclinical merck a  b or c pain leads identified grunenthal neuropeptide y y obesity early preclinical novartis y pain discovery y anxiety and depression leads identified galanin   and obesity  diabetes  cloning and warner alzheimer s disease  discovery lambert depression and pain the company is working on receptor and drug discovery programs in addition to those programs referenced in the above table 
in general  the drug discovery and receptor discovery programs that are specifically referenced in the above table are at more advanced stages of development than those that are not specifically referenced in the table 
cloning refers to the stage at which the company is attempting to discover  identify and clone the genes for specific receptor subtypes 
discovery refers to the stage at which chemists are attempting to identify receptor subtype selective compounds through the use of the company s drug discovery systems 
leads identified refers to the stage at which receptor subtype selective compounds have been identified through the use of the company s drug discovery systems 
early preclinical refers to the stage at which one or more leads have been identified and are being tested in in vitro or in vivo model systems for one or more indications 
in addition  at this stage lead compounds may have been shown to be active in animal models for one or more indications and preliminary toxicology and pharmacokinetics studies will also have been concluded 
late preclinical refers to the stage preceding the phase i clinical stage at which a clinical candidate has been selected  scale up of such candidate is underway or completed  and toxicology and pharmacokinetics studies are planned or underway or have been concluded 
phase i clinical refers to the stage preceding the phase ii clinical stage at which a drug candidate is being or has been administered to a small group of healthy human subjects for the purpose of testing for safety adverse effects  dose tolerance  absorption  bio distribution  metabolism  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase ii clinical refers to the stage at which a drug candidate is being or has been administered to a small sample of the actual intended patient population to seek to assess the efficacy of the drug candidate for the specific targeted indication  to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
phase iii clinical refers to the stage at which a drug candidate is being or has been administered to a broader sample of the general patient population at geographically dispersed study sites to establish further clinical safety and efficacy of the drug candidates in order to determine its overall risk benefit ratio and to provide an adequate basis for all physician labeling 
the specific receptor subtype that is the focus of this program is confidential to the company and its collaborative partner 
while synaptic is currently conducting this program independently  synaptic has agreed to reserve the y receptor as a potential target for drugs for the alleviation of pain exclusively for its collaboration with grunenthal 
serotonin programs serotonin is one of the major neurotransmitters  a type of ligand  of the body 
it affects mood  sleep rhythms  sexual functions  appetite  temperature control  gastro intestinal movement and the cardiovascular  pulmonary and genito urinary systems 
drugs that inhibit or enhance the actions of serotonin have proven to be effective in the treatment of an array of disorders  such as migraine headache  depression and anxiety 
however  none of the limited number of serotonergic drugs currently available was designed with the use of cloned serotonin receptor subtype genes and some of these drugs have undesirable side effect profiles 
it is generally believed that the poor side effect profiles stem from the interaction of these drugs with multiple serotonin receptor subtypes 
the serotonin family is extremely large  comprising at least receptor subtypes 
while each of these receptor subtypes may be implicated in a physiological function distinct from the other subtypes  all of the receptor subtypes respond to the neurotransmitter serotonin and may be responding to non subtype selective drugs 
as a consequence  a non subtype selective drug intended to exert its effects on one physiological function may in fact have the unintended consequence of exerting its effects on other physiological functions  thereby causing the undesirable side effects 
of the serotonin receptor subtype genes that have been discovered and cloned  the company believes that it is responsible for the discovery and cloning of seven 
the company has been issued united states patents covering six of these receptor genes and related drug discovery systems 
a patent application covering the seventh of these genes and the related drug discovery system and additional patent applications relating to all of these genes have been filed in the united states 
in addition  several corresponding patent applications have been filed in other countries 
the company has found  through the use of these cloned receptor genes and related drug discovery systems  that the serotonin system is significantly more complex than had previously been understood and believes that the use of its technology to design serotonin receptor subtype selective drugs will result in new serotonergic drugs with improved efficacy and side effect profiles  as well as serotonergic drugs for new therapeutic applications 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in designing a serotonin receptor subtype selective drug that will achieve the foregoing desired effect 
the company  in collaboration with lilly  is currently conducting drug discovery programs focused on a number of serotonin receptor subtypes and therapeutic applications 
as part of the collaboration  compounds supplied by lilly are assayed by the company in its serotonin receptor subtype drug discovery systems 
to date  receptor subtype selective compounds have been identified for a number of serotonin programs 
the program focused on the discovery and development of a drug for the treatment of migraine headache is currently in phase ii clinical trials in europe and as of march   lilly confirmed that it expects to complete such trials and to begin analyzing the data from the trials during the second quarter of in connection with the collaboration  lilly received an exclusive worldwide license to use all but two of the company s existing serotonin drug discovery systems for the development and commercialization of serotonergic drugs 
certain of the serotonin programs are described below 
migraine headache migraine headaches are periodic throbbing headaches often accompanied by nausea and vomiting 
one of the newer drugs available for the treatment of migraine  imitrex r  is an agonist of certain serotonin receptor subtypes that was discovered using the traditional approach to drug discovery 
although effective in most patients  the drug has been associated with the tightening of the coronary blood vessels 
as a result  the drug is contraindicated both in patients with ischemic heart disease and in patients with symptoms of ischemic heart disease 
in addition  because of the cardiovascular risks  it is recommended that  in the case of any patient in whom unrecognized coronary disease is comparatively likely  the first dose of the drug be administered in a physician s office 
finally  the drug is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
therefore  to be most effective  it must be given by injection or by nasal spray 
the company and lilly are focused on developing anti migraine compounds with increased efficacy and reduced side effects 
through the use of its serotonin receptor subtype drug discovery systems  synaptic scientists discovered that imitrex r reacted strongly with three serotonin receptor subtypes  serotonin b and d  both of which were long thought to be the targets for anti migraine effects  as well as serotonin f 
synaptic scientists proposed that the appropriate serotonin receptor subtype for the treatment of migraine is the serotonin f receptor subtype 
together with scientists at lilly  synaptic scientists identified compounds that are selective agonists of the serotonin f receptor subtype 
these compounds were tested in animal models at lilly and shown to be orally active and to have a long duration of action 
the compounds were also shown to be potent in an animal model that is thought by many scientists in the field to be predictive of therapeutic utility for the treatment of migraine 
furthermore  these compounds were inactive in vasoconstriction assays at lilly  thereby suggesting that the possible adverse events reported for imitrex r would not limit the treatment potential of a f selective agonist for migraine 
lilly is currently conducting phase ii clinical trials with one of these compounds in europe 
synaptic has been issued a united states patent covering the use of genetically engineered cells expressing the human serotonin f receptor subtype to identify compounds that bind to the receptor subtype  as well as a united states patent covering the gene encoding the receptor subtype 
in addition  lilly has been issued a united states patent covering the use of f agonists exhibiting minimal vasoconstrictive effects for the treatment of migraine 
the company and lilly are also focused on the discovery of safer and more efficacious drugs for the prophylactic treatment of migraine 
despite significant progress in the development of therapies for the acute treatment of migraine  much less progress has been made in the development of a prophylactic treatment 
patients who regularly experience two to six migraines per month are  according to criteria established by the international headache society  considered to be candidates for such a treatment 
presently  two beta adrenergic blockers  inderal r and blocadren r  ergot alkaloids  such as sansert r  and an anticonvulsant  depakote r  have been approved for the prophylaxis of migraine 
these drugs generally have limited efficacy due to their potential for significant deleterious side effects 
inderal r and blocadren r must be used with caution in patients with certain pulmonary diseases because they can produce bronchoconstriction and in patients with congestive heart failure because they can cause coronary depression 
ergot alkaloids can cause vasoconstriction leading to myocardial ischemia or gangrene in the extremities and should not be used by pregnant women 
depakote r can cause fatal hepatic failure and  like ergot alkaloids  should be avoided by pregnant women 
through the use of synaptic s serotonin receptor subtype drug discovery systems  scientists at synaptic and lilly have discovered compounds that are selective antagonists of the serotonin b receptor subtype  which is thought to be a potential target for migraine prophylaxis 
these compounds are active in an animal model that is thought by many scientists in the field to be predictive of therapeutic utility for the treatment of migraine and it is believed that such compounds may provide safer and more effective prophylactic therapy for those who suffer frequent migraine 
one of these compounds has been selected by lilly for possible development and is undergoing late preclinical testing 
smoking cessation there are more than million smokers in major market countries  more than million of whom attempt each year to quit smoking 
chronic use of tobacco is causally linked to a variety of serious diseases  including coronary heart disease  cancer and emphysema 
nicotine patches and nicotine gum have been used as smoking cessation aids  but have met with limited success 
recently  wellbutrin r  which has been available for a number of years as an antidepressant  was approved by the united states food and drug administration the fda for marketing in a sustained release formulation zyban r for use as an aid to smoking cessation 
clinical studies show that zyban r  either alone or in combination with transdermal nicotine  increases the rate of smoking cessation 
however  the long term response rate to zyban r as an aid in smoking cessation is low about 
in addition  the active ingredient in zyban r has been reported to cause seizures in about of patients  along with agitation and insomnia 
the company and lilly are engaged in a program to identify and develop serotonin a antagonists which ameliorate the withdrawal symptoms frequently suffered in connection with smoking cessation 
as part of the program  the company and lilly have designed novel compounds which are highly selective for and are potent antagonists of the serotonin a receptor subtype 
these compounds have been shown to be effective in an animal model of nicotine withdrawal and may lead to drugs which are more effective as smoking cessation aids than those currently available 
obesity drug treatment for obesity has traditionally been used as a short term adjunct to diet and exercise 
most drugs approved for the treatment of obesity act centrally through catecholaminergic and or serotonergic pathways 
earlier compounds  such as benzedrine r and dexedrine r  were plagued by problems of tolerance  abuse and cardiovascular side effects 
more recently  pondimin r and redux r  which act by releasing the neurotransmitter serotonin  were widely used  either alone or in combination with phentermine phen fen 
however  both of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market pursuant to a request by the fda because they appear to cause heart valve defects and pulmonary hypertension 
the mechanism by which pondimin r and redux r cause this cardiac and pulmonary toxicity is unknown  but similar toxicity is not seen with other serotonergic drugs  such as prozac r and zoloft r  which are widely used as antidepressants 
while it has been proven that serotonergic transmission can regulate food intake  it has not been clear which of the serotonin receptor subtypes is responsible for this action 
studies involving genetically altered mice which lack serotonin c receptors indicate that this serotonin receptor subtype may play a role 
these mice are normal at birth but become obese as they get older  and their obesity is associated with increases in food intake levels and insulin resistance 
a possible correlation in humans is provided by the observation that patients treated with drugs such as clozapine  imipramine  and amitriptyline  all of which have  in addition to their principal actions  substantial blockade of the serotonin c receptors  are associated with weight gain 
the company and scientists at lilly are collaborating to identify and develop compounds which are selective for the serotonin c receptor over other serotonin receptor subtypes that may be responsible for undesirable side effects 
the company s serotonin receptor subtype drug discovery systems have made it possible to discover subtype selective compounds that may be effective treatments for obesity through this serotonin c mechanism 
subtype selective compounds which suppress food intake in animal models have been identified and are under evaluation for their suitability as drug candidates 
depression a number of different pharmacologic strategies have been developed to treat depression 
the early drugs shown to be effective in the treatment of depression  such as the tricyclic antidepressants  lithium and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors  have side effects associated with their use that limit their effectiveness 
recently  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri  such as prozac r  zoloft r and paxil r  have been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of many forms of depression 
a number of ssri compounds are now approved for marketing  and these drugs have captured a significant market share 
however  all of these currently available drugs have significant deleterious side effects in many patients which may limit their use 
in addition  these drugs have a lag time before their beneficial clinical effects can be seen 
this lag time can be a serious problem  especially in the depressed suicidal patient 
furthermore  there are a significant number of patients that do not adequately respond to any of the currently available drug therapies 
scientists at synaptic and lilly have identified novel serotonin receptor subtype selective compounds that may have rapid onset of efficacy in the treatment of depression and that may also have better side effect profiles than drugs currently available 
one of these compounds has been selected by lilly for possible development and is undergoing late preclinical testing 
other serotonin programs the company has cloned additional serotonin receptor subtypes that are either not currently being pursued by it and lilly as drug targets in their collaborative drug discovery programs or are being so pursued but are focused on therapeutic applications which are currently confidential to the company and lilly 
in addition  there is evidence to suggest that one or more serotonin receptor subtypes that are the targets of the drug discovery programs currently being conducted by the company and lilly may be relevant as targets for other therapeutic applications 
the company expects that it and lilly will establish additional drug discovery programs focused on certain of these other serotonin receptor subtypes or therapeutic applications in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will establish additional drug discovery programs with lilly 
alpha adrenergic programs alpha adrenergic receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine noradrenaline 
the alpha adrenergic receptors serve a critical control function in regulating involuntary physiological functions  such as blood pressure  heart rate and smooth muscle tone  and thus may serve as important tools in the management of many disorders  such as bph 
until  only two alpha adrenergic receptors alpha and alpha were believed to exist 
since then  scientists have discovered that the alpha adrenergic receptor family contains at least six subtypes alpha a  b and d and alpha a  b and c 
the company believes it was responsible for the discovery of the genes that code for four of the six alpha adrenergic subtypes in humans 
the company has received united states patents relating to two of these genes and related drug discovery systems 
additional patent applications relating to one of these genes have been filed both in the united states and in other countries 
there are a number of adrenergic drugs on the market today which are effective in the treatment of a variety of disorders 
however  most of these drugs were discovered in the s prior to the discovery of the six alpha adrenergic subtypes and are not selective for any one of these receptor subtypes 
the company believes that many of the side effects associated with these drugs may be traced to a lack of selectivity for the appropriate receptor subtypes 
the company is using its alpha adrenergic drug discovery systems to discover compounds with increased receptor subtype selectivity and is involved in two programs involving alpha adrenergic receptor subtypes the alpha a antagonist program and the alpha adrenergic program 
there can be no assurance that the company or any collaborative partner will be successful in designing an alpha adrenergic receptor subtype selective drug with improved efficacy and an improved side effect profile 
the company and merck are collaborating on the alpha a antagonist program to develop drugs for the treatment of bph 
the company and grunenthal are collaborating on the alpha adrenergic program to develop drugs for the alleviation of pain 
these programs are described below 
benign prostatic hyperplasia bph is a pathology of the prostate  a walnut sized gland in men that surrounds the urethra as it exits the bladder 
as men age  cells in the prostate proliferate  causing growth in the prostatic tissue which in turn results in pressure on the urethra 
common symptoms of bph include urinary retention  hesitancy or difficulty initiating the stream of urine  urinary frequency  a sense of urgency and a sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder 
the incomplete emptying of the bladder caused by bph can also lead to urinary tract infections and bladder damage 
in severe cases  the flow of urine can become completely blocked and lead to kidney failure 
there are several treatment options available for bph 
transurethral resection of the prostate turp was used in approximately  men in the united states in this surgical procedure results in significant benefit 
however  surgery is an unattractive alternative for many patients because of its potential adverse consequences  and is not recommended for elderly patients due to the potential for complications 
another surgical procedure  transurethral needle ablation tuna  was recently approved by the fda and may have the advantage of possible use on an out patient basis under local anesthesia 
however  initial results of a recent study comparing turp to tuna show a lower level of efficacy in tuna than in turp with respect to increasing urinary flow 
two different non surgical alternatives for the treatment of bph in patients who either are not candidates for or elect not to have surgery are currently available 
the first alternative is a type of drug that acts by inhibiting the enzyme alpha reductase  which is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate 
by reducing levels of dihydrotestosterone  which plays a role in growth of prostatic tissue  this type of drug is intended to shrink the gland 
an example of this type of drug is proscar r 
although there is a rapid regression of the enlarged gland in most patients  less than of patients experience an increase in urine flow and improvement of symptoms when treated with proscar r for months 
a minimum of six months treatment may be necessary to determine whether an individual will respond to the drug 
the second type of drug for the treatment of bph involves the use of alpha adrenergic antagonists  such as hytrin r and cardura r  that act by blocking alpha adrenergic stimulation of the prostate 
this blocking activity causes a relaxation of the musculature of the prostate  thereby improving urinary flow and providing other symptomatic relief of bph 
these drugs were initially developed as antihypertensive agents in the mid s prior to the discovery that there existed three distinct subtypes of the alpha receptor  and are not selective for any particular alpha subtype 
while rapid symptomatic improvement in approximately of patients treated with this type of drug has been observed  dose dependent side effects  including hypotension which causes dizziness  headache  weakness  nasal congestion and peripheral edema  are commonly associated with the treatment 
the side effects limit the recommended dose for these drugs 
the most significant side effect  hypotension  is particularly detrimental to elderly patients 
recently  another alpha antagonist  flomax r  was approved for use in the treatment of bph 
flomax r is claimed to be uroselective  but its labeling carries warnings of side effects  such as postural hypotension  dizziness and vertigo  similar to those of hytrin r 
through the use of its alpha adrenergic drug discovery systems and by means of in vivo studies  synaptic discovered that different receptor subtypes are involved in the control of prostate musculature and blood pressure the alpha a receptor subtype is responsible for contraction of prostate musculature and other alpha subtypes are involved in the regulation of blood pressure 
this discovery confirmed the company s hypothesis that many of the side effects caused by alpha adrenergic antagonists currently available for the treatment of bph stemmed from their lack of selectivity for the receptor subtype involved in relaxation of prostate musculature 
the company has been issued united states patents covering the use of selective alpha a antagonists for the treatment of bph the bph use patents 
in addition  synaptic has been issued a united states patent covering the use of genetically engineered cells expressing the human alpha a adrenergic receptor subtype to identify compounds that bind to the receptor subtype  as well as a united states patent covering the gene encoding the receptor subtype 
the company  in collaboration with merck  is using the company s drug discovery systems to design compounds that block the activity of the alpha a receptor subtype  thereby producing the desired effects on the prostate  but that have minimal affinity for alpha b and alpha d receptor subtypes  thereby substantially reducing the cardiovascular effects seen with currently available non selective alpha adrenergic antagonists 
a compound selected by merck is in the late preclinical stage of testing 
other leads have also been identified and are in the early or late preclinical stage of testing 
as part of the collaboration  synaptic granted merck a nonexclusive worldwide license under certain of its patent rights  including the company s alpha adrenergic receptor patents and patent applications  to develop and commercialize alpha a antagonists 
synaptic also granted merck as part of the collaboration an exclusive worldwide license to use synaptic s alpha a selective compounds and know how  as well as an exclusive worldwide license under certain of the company s patent rights  including the bph use patents and related patent applications  for the same purposes 
however  in march  merck granted back to synaptic such rights as were necessary to enable synaptic to grant to glaxo pursuant to the glaxo agreement a limited license under the bph use patents and an option to obtain an additional license under the bph use patents 
pain analgesic agents are used to relieve pain analgesia 
analgesics most commonly used for severe pain are narcotics 
although very effective  narcotic analgesic agents carry the risk of depressing respiration and causing nausea and vomiting  and their repeated use may lead to addiction 
it is believed that non narcotic analgesics would be beneficial to many patient populations suffering from severe pain 
alpha agonists have been broadly used and are highly effective as veterinary analgesics 
animal data indicate that these agents do not cause respiratory depression 
in addition  their action can be reversed with appropriate drugs 
however  they cause both sedation and hypotension when administered within the analgesic dose range 
alpha agents have not yet been developed as analgesics for human use  in part due to concerns regarding potential deleterious side effects  such as sedation and hypotension 
synaptic believes that its drug discovery systems for the three human alpha adrenergic receptor subtypes can be used to discover alpha analgesics which have significantly fewer deleterious side effects than currently available analgesics and the effects of which may be rapidly reversed 
the company has identified alpha agonists with analgesic activity in laboratory animal models and recently entered into a collaboration with grunenthal in which this drug discovery program is being pursued 
neuropeptide y programs neuropeptides are neurotransmitters 
unlike neurotransmitters that are small molecules  such as norepinephrine and serotonin  neuropeptides are much larger molecules 
the mode of action of neuropeptides  however  resembles that of small molecule neurotransmitters in that they function by means of an interaction with specific families of receptors  including families within the g protein coupled receptor superfamily 
although current knowledge of neuropeptides and their receptors is significantly less extensive than knowledge of small molecule neurotransmitters and their receptors  subtypes have been shown to exist for several families of neuropeptide receptors 
one focus of the company in its receptor and drug discovery efforts in this area has been on the npy family of receptors 
although the natural ligand for this family  npy  is a large molecule  the goal of this drug discovery program is  as is the case in all of the company s other drug discovery programs  to design a small molecule drug 
large peptide like molecules would not be stable in the body and thus would have short durations of action and would not be orally available  thus requiring delivery by injection 
to date  there is evidence for the existence in humans of at least five npy receptor subtypes  named y  y  y  y and y however  the discovery and cloning of the genes for only four of these subtypes have been reported 
in and  the company was awarded united states patents covering the genes that code for the y  y and y receptor subtypes and related drug discovery systems 
synaptic has filed additional patent applications relating to these discoveries in the united states and in other countries 
the company is currently conducting one npy receptor and drug discovery program in collaboration with novartis focused on obesity 
another npy drug discovery program currently being conducted by the company focused on pain is contractually reserved for and may become a joint program as part of the company s collaboration with grunenthal 
the company is seeking a collaborative partner to work with the company on its third npy drug discovery program involving anxiety and depression 
there can be no assurance that the npy drug discovery program focused on pain will become a joint program as part of the grunenthal collaboration  that the company will be successful in consummating a collaborative arrangement with respect to its npy drug discovery program focused on anxiety and depression with another company or that the company or any collaborative partner will be successful in designing safe and effective npy receptor subtype selective drugs 
obesity animal studies have shown that npy is the most potent stimulator of food intake identified to date 
as little as one billionth of a gram of npy injected directly into the hypothalamus  a key brain area that controls appetite  causes well fed  satiated rats to overeat 
repeated administration of npy causes continual overeating and obesity 
a y receptor was initially isolated by the company s scientists from rat hypothalamus 
in laboratory tests  the activity of npy and related peptides on the y receptor mirrored the ability of these peptides to stimulate feeding in animals 
as part of its collaboration with the company  novartis then showed that several peptides that activated the y receptor preferentially over other known npy receptors increased food intake in rats 
additional studies by synaptic and novartis showed that small molecules that selectively block the y receptor significantly reduce food intake in rats 
based upon these studies  synaptic believes that the y receptor is a feeding receptor  and that compounds that are selective for this receptor subtype may lead to new approaches to the treatment of obesity 
the company and novartis are thus focused on discovering and developing a potent and selective y antagonist for the treatment of obesity 
as part of its collaboration with the company  novartis has an exclusive license to use the company s npy receptor subtype drug discovery systems for the development and commercialization of y antagonists  as well as any other npy drugs  for the treatment of eating disorders 
pain as part of its efforts to discover non narcotic drugs for the alleviation of pain  the company is conducting a program focused on the design and development of analgesics that stimulate the y receptor subtype 
direct injection of npy into the spinal cord produces a high level of analgesia in laboratory animals 
this effect is believed to be related to npy s ability to stimulate y receptors 
these receptors control the release of chemical messengers  such as substance p  which mediate the transmission of pain responses 
synaptic believes that orally active small molecule agonists which would mimic the effects of npy at the y receptor may offer a new approach to the alleviation of pain that would not result in the side effects typically associated with narcotic analgesics 
although the company and grunenthal have not yet initiated a joint program focused on the design and development of y selective compounds for the alleviation of pain  as part of its collaboration with grunenthal  synaptic has agreed to reserve the y receptor subtype as a potential target for such drugs exclusively for the collaboration until the expiration of the collaborative agreement 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company and grunenthal will establish a joint drug discovery program focused on the y receptor subtype 
anxiety anxiety is a sense of irrational fear or dread and is one of the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses in the united states 
there is a variety of pharmacologic treatments for anxiety  the most commonly used of which belong to the class of compounds called benzodiazepines  an example of which is valium r 
this class of compounds  however  is associated with significant side effects  including drowsiness  impairment of motor skills  memory loss and the exacerbation of intoxication by alcohol 
another serious side effect associated with the benzodiazepines is their potential to be addictive 
behavioral studies have suggested that npy can produce anxiety in rats by activating the y receptor subtype  raising the prospect that a small molecule y receptor antagonist may provide a novel treatment for anxiety devoid of the side effects commonly associated with currently available anxiolytics 
thus  the goal of this drug discovery program is to design compounds that selectively block the y receptor subtype 
galanin program galanin is a neurotransmitter which  like npy  is a neuropeptide 
galanin is widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and the brain 
pharmacologic studies suggest the existence of multiple receptor subtypes for this neuropeptide 
there are a number of possible therapeutic applications for drugs that modulate galanin receptors  including the treatment of obesity  diabetes  alzheimer s disease  depression and pain 
most of the research done to date with galanin has focused on its role in the control of food intake 
injection of galanin into the brain has been shown to produce an increase in food intake in satiated rats 
as a result  galanin receptor antagonists might result in a reduction of food intake and may thus be useful in the treatment of obesity 
the company has discovered and cloned genes that code for galanin receptor subtypes and has filed patent applications relating to these discoveries 
in july  the company entered into a collaboration with warner lambert to identify and develop galanin receptor subtype selective compounds for a variety of therapeutic applications 
the company and warner lambert are currently attempting to identify and characterize galanin receptor subtype selective compounds 
there can be no assurance that the company or warner lambert will be successful in identifying or developing any such compound 
other programs the company is pursuing additional receptor discovery programs  the identities of which have not yet been disclosed 
these programs involve the use of the company s molecular biology resources to clone members of selected g protein coupled receptor families in a focused manner 
in addition  the company is engaged in cloning other g protein coupled receptors using a genomics approach 
this approach involves the sequencing of genes from various types of tissues selected by the company based upon their potential association with a therapeutic application of interest to the company 
the company is also developing technology  and exploring in licensing opportunities  for the purpose of obtaining high throughput functional assays for its receptor discoveries 
the company is also pursuing several drug discovery programs  the applications of which have not yet been disclosed 
collaborative and licensing arrangements a key element of the company s business strategy is to leverage resources and to generate royalty based revenues through collaborative and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies 
the company is currently collaborating with five pharmaceutical companies pursuant to i the research  option and license agreement dated as of january   as amended  with lilly the lilly agreement  ii the research collaboration and license agreement dated as of november   as amended  with merck the merck agreement  iii the research and license agreement dated as of august   as amended the first novartis agreement  and the research and license agreement dated as of may  the second novartis agreement  and together with the first novartis agreement  the novartis agreements  each with novartis  iv the collaborative research and license agreement dated as of july   with warner lambert the warner lambert agreement  and v the cooperation agreement dated as of january   with grunenthal the grunenthal agreement  and together with the lilly agreement  the merck agreement  the novartis agreements  and the warner lambert agreement  the collaborative agreements 
in addition to its collaborative arrangements  in march  the company granted to glaxo pursuant to the glaxo agreement a license under its patent rights  and an option to obtain an additional license under its patent rights  relating to certain of its technology 
while the company evaluates on an ongoing basis potential collaborative and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies  there can be no assurance that it will be able to enter into acceptable collaborative and licensing arrangements in the future or that any such arrangement  whether existing or future  will be successful 
the following summarizes the company s existing collaborative and licensing arrangements 
lilly agreement in january  the company and lilly entered into the lilly agreement to promote the discovery and development of serotonin receptor subtype selective drugs for the treatment of serotonin related disorders 
the collaboration was extended in january for an additional four year period expiring in december the company and lilly agreed to substantially increase the size of their collaboration in october during the initial four year term of the collaboration  lilly provided the company with an aggregate of approximately million of funding to support a specified number of the company s scientists who conducted research as part of the collaboration 
the aggregate amount of research support to be provided by lilly during the second four year period is expected to be approximately million 
all development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of drugs resulting from the collaboration will be conducted by lilly 
the company is also entitled to receive from lilly payments upon the achievement of certain drug development milestones and royalties on sales of all drugs developed through the use of the company s technology 
such royalties will be payable in respect of sales in any country over the period commencing with the date of the first commercial sale of a drug and ending with the expiration of related patent rights in that country 
lilly paid the company a one time fee of million for an exclusive worldwide license to use all but two of the company s existing serotonin drug discovery systems for the development and commercialization of drugs that affect serotonergic transmission 
the company retains the unlimited right to use two of its existing serotonin drug discovery systems and a limited right to use all of its other serotonin drug discovery systems in furtherance of its collaboration with lilly and for cross reactivity screening in its and its other collaborators non serotonin drug discovery programs 
as part of the collaboration  lilly was also granted certain exclusive rights under several of the company s patents and patent applications 
lilly purchased million of equity in synaptic in june  and in december  lilly purchased an additional million of equity in synaptic in its initial public offering pursuant to the terms of the extension 
lilly has since sold all of such shares 
merck agreement in november  the company and merck entered into the merck agreement pursuant to which they agreed to collaborate in the identification and development of alpha a antagonists  principally for the treatment of bph 
the initial term of the collaboration was three years 
in october  the term of the collaboration was extended through november and in november  the term of the collaboration was again extended for an additional year through november as part of the collaboration  synaptic granted merck a nonexclusive worldwide license under certain other patent rights  including the company s alpha adrenergic receptor patents and patent applications to develop and commercialize alpha a antagonists 
synaptic also granted merck as part of the collaborationan exclusive worldwide license to use the company s alpha a selective compounds and know how  as well as an exclusive worldwide license under certain of the company s patent rights  including its bph use patents and related patent applications  for the same purposes 
however  in march  merck granted back to synaptic such rights as were necessary to enable synaptic to grant to glaxo pursuant to the glaxo agreement a limited license under the bph use patents and an option to obtain an additional license under the bph use patents 
the company retained the right to use its alpha adrenergic technology for the development of alpha adrenergic and other agents that are not alpha a antagonists 
in consideration for the licenses granted to merck  merck originally agreed to provide the company with up to million in research funding  license fees and milestone payments  as well as to pay the company royalties on product sales 
this amount was subsequently increased by agreement of the company and merck to million 
novartis agreements in august  the company and novartis entered into the first novartis agreement pursuant to which they agreed to collaborate in the identification and development of npy drugs for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders  as well as cardiovascular disorders 
in may  the company and novartis entered into the second novartis agreement and an amendment to the first novartis agreement pursuant to which the term of the collaboration was extended by one year and the scope of the collaboration was expanded to provide for research on additional targets for the design of drugs for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders 
the term of the collaboration under the two novartis agreements expires in august during the term  novartis is required to provide the company with funding to support a specified number of the company s scientists dedicated to work on the collaboration 
through december   novartis had provided the company with an aggregate of approximately million in research support 
the aggregate amount of research support which the company is entitled to receive from novartis for the period from january   through the remainder of the collaboration is million 
in july  novartis made a million payment to the company for achieving a research milestone 
novartis is also required to make additional payments to the company upon the achievement by novartis of certain drug development milestones and  subject to certain limitations  to pay the company royalties on the sale of drugs developed through the use of the company s technology 
at the commencement of the company s collaboration with novartis  novartis made a million equity investment in the company 
in december  as part of the company s initial public offering  novartis made an additional million equity investment in the company 
as of december   the  shares of common stock acquired by novartis as a result of these investments were held by novartis produkte ag  an affiliate of novartis 
such shares represented of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company at that date 
as part of the collaboration  synaptic granted novartis an exclusive worldwide license to use the company s npy receptor subtype drug discovery systems for the development and commercialization of npy receptor subtype selective drugs for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders  as well as cardiovascular disorders 
synaptic also granted novartis an exclusive worldwide license to use any proprietary technology of the company that relates to the subject matter of the second novartis agreement to design drugs for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders 
in addition  the company granted novartis certain rights under several of the company s patents and patent applications 
the company retained the right to use its npy receptor subtype drug discovery systems and other technology for all other therapeutic applications  although novartis has a right of first negotiation in the event the company determines to seek a collaborative partner or licensee for any such other indication 
novartis has declined its right of first negotiation with respect to the use of the company s npy receptor subtype drug discovery systems and other technology for the discovery and development of y receptor subtype selective drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and  as a result  the company has the right to use the technology  independently or with third parties  for such purpose 
warner lambert agreement in july  the company and warner lambert entered into the warner lambert agreement pursuant to which they agreed to collaborate in the identification and development of galanin drugs for a variety of therapeutic applications 
as part of the collaboration  warner lambert received an exclusive worldwide license to use the company s galanin receptor subtype drug discovery systems for the development and commercialization of galanin receptor subtype selective drugs for all therapeutic applications 
the collaboration involves two potential stages 
during the first stage  which commenced in october and will last up to months  each partner will fund its own research and use synaptic s galanin receptor subtype drug discovery systems to attempt to identify and characterize drug candidates 
the second stage of the collaboration  which will last for three years  will commence at such time as the partners identify galanin compounds that are active in animal models 
during this stage  warner lambert and synaptic will attempt to develop drug candidates identified during the first stage  as well as attempt to identify additional drug candidates 
upon the commencement of the second stage  synaptic is entitled to receive research funding from warner lambert  as well as to require warner lambert to purchase equity in synaptic 
in addition  synaptic is entitled to receive drug development milestones and royalties on sales of all drugs identified through the collaboration 
there can be no assurance  however  that any suitable galanin compound will be identified which would trigger commencement of the second stage of the collaboration or that  even assuming the commencement of such stage  a product will result from this collaboration 
grunenthal agreement in january  the company and grunenthal entered into the grunenthal agreement pursuant to which they agreed to collaborate in the identification and development of drugs for the alleviation of pain 
as part of the collaboration  the companies will jointly select receptors that may play a role in the alleviation of pain and attempt to identify compounds that are active at the selected receptors for further study in grunenthal s animal model systems 
the selected receptors may be receptors known to be implicated in the transmission or inhibition of pain or receptors whose function has not yet been elucidated but which are cloned from tissues known to be so implicated 
the companies are responsible for their own expenses incurred during the research stage of any project undertaken as part of the collaboration but will each be responsible for of all development costs incurred as part of the project with respect to any resulting drug candidates up to the commencement of phase iii clinical trials 
synaptic will retain manufacturing and marketing rights in the united states  canada and mexico with respect to any drug candidates resulting from the collaboration  while grunenthal will retain manufacturing and marketing rights in europe  central america other than mexico and south america with respect to any such candidates 
the two companies will share these rights in all other countries 
with respect to each country in its own territories and in the shared territories in which it desires to market a drug candidate  each of synaptic and grunenthal will be responsible for conducting phase iii clinical trials  if required  for obtaining any necessary regulatory approval  and for all associated costs 
as part of the collaboration  synaptic agreed to make available to grunenthal for evaluation all receptors cloned by synaptic that may be implicated in pain to the extent not already licensed exclusively to a third party and not to pursue such receptors  independently or with any third party  as targets of potential drugs for the alleviation of pain during the evaluation period applicable to the receptors or during the period over which activities involving any such receptor are being jointly conducted with grunenthal 
glaxo agreement in march  the company and glaxo entered into the glaxo agreement pursuant to which the company granted glaxo i a nonexclusive license under the company s alpha adrenergic receptor patents to develop and sell alpha a selective compounds for therapeutic applications other than the treatment of bph and ii until may   a nonexclusive license under its alpha adrenergic receptor patents and its bph use patents to develop but not to commercialize alpha a selective compounds for the treatment of bph 
in addition  the company granted glaxo an option to obtain a nonexclusive license under its alpha adrenergic receptor patents and its bph use patents to develop and commercialize alpha a selective compounds for the treatment of bph 
such option is exercisable by glaxo only until may   upon the payment to synaptic of an additional amount 
as consideration for the foregoing licenses and option  glaxo made a  payment to synaptic 
synaptic is also entitled to receive royalties on sales of all alpha a selective drugs sold by glaxo so long as synaptic has an issued patent relating to an alpha adrenergic receptor subtype in at least one major market country  as well as royalties on sales of any alpha a antagonist for the treatment of bph in any country in which synaptic has an issued bph use patent 
other agreements the company s practice is to meet with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on an on going basis to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on projects of mutual interest  which may include the company s existing research programs that are not yet the subject of collaborations 
in addition  the company continually evaluates opportunities for out licensing its technology on a collaborative basis or on a noncollaborative basis  in licensing third party technologies and or cross licensing technology to maximally leverage resources 
at present  the company is in the early stages of discussing with other companies the possibility of a number of such arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating any such arrangement 
in february  the company and the dupont merck pharmaceutical company dupont merck entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company granted dupont merck a nonexclusive license to use certain of the company s alpha adrenergic drug discovery systems for the development of alpha adrenergic subtype selective drugs 
the license granted to dupont merck expired in february patents  proprietary technology and trade secrets the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to establish  protect and enforce its proprietary rights relating to its technology 
the company s policy is to seek  when appropriate  protection for its gene discoveries  compound discoveries and other proprietary technology by filing patent applications in the united states and other countries 
the company has filed numerous patent applications both in the united states and in other countries covering its inventions 
as of march   the company had been issued united states patents relating to the genes that code for the human serotonin b  serotonin d  serotonin e  serotonin f  serotonin a  alpha a adrenergic  alpha b adrenergic  npy  npy and npy receptor subtypes and related drug discovery systems  as well as a united states patent covering the rat serotonin a receptor subtype and related drug discovery systems 
these patents expire at various times from to several united states patent applications relating to the company s receptor gene discoveries were pending 
in addition  several corresponding patents had been issued in other countries and additional corresponding patent applications had been filed in other countries 
in april  the company was issued its first functional use patent in the united states 
this patent covers the use of selective alpha a antagonists for the treatment of bph 
in addition  in november  the united states patent and trademark office issued the company an additional patent relating to the same subject matter 
these patents expire in additional related patent applications are on file in the united states 
in addition  corresponding patents have been issued in other countries and additional corresponding patent applications have been filed in other countries 
the company has also filed patent applications in the united states and in other countries covering its neurotransmitter transporter discoveries 
whereas receptors are protein molecules which bind to and are activated by certain ligands  transporters are protein molecules which serve to terminate the action of certain ligands by carrying them back into the cells from which they are released 
as of march   the company had been issued united states patents covering three of these transporter discoveries 
the company is no longer actively working on its transporter program 
however  the transporter technology  insofar as it may be used to design drugs for the alleviation of pain  has been reserved exclusively for evaluation by grunenthal as the potential focus of a joint program between the company and grunenthal pursuant to the grunenthal agreement 
in addition  the company is seeking to license its transporter technology for other uses to one or more other companies 
additional patent applications covering the company s compound discoveries and other inventions have been filed in the united states and in other countries and the company intends to file additional patent applications in the future 
the company has granted certain rights under several of its patents and patent applications to lilly  merck  novartis  warner lambert  grunenthal and glaxo 
patent law as it relates to inventions in the biotechnology field is still evolving  and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that patents will be granted with respect to any of the company s patent applications currently pending in the united states or in other countries  or with respect to applications filed by the company in the future 
the failure by the company to receive patents pursuant to the applications referred to herein and any future applications could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed in patents or the degree of protection afforded thereunder 
accordingly  no firm predictions can be made regarding the breadth or enforceability of claims allowed in the patents that have been issued to the company or in patents that may be issued to the company in the future and there can be no assurance that claims in the company s patents  either as initially allowed by the united states patent and trademark office or any of its non united states counterparts or as subsequently interpreted by courts inside or outside the united states  will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s proprietary rights 
also  there can be no assurance that the company s patents or patent applications will not be challenged by way of interference proceedings or opposed by third parties or that the company will not be required to participate in interference proceedings or oppose the patents or patent applications of third parties in order to protect its rights 
interference and opposition proceedings can be expensive to prosecute and defend 
as of march   one of the company s patent applications on file outside the united states was the subject of an opposition filed by a pharmaceutical company and one of the company s patent applications on file in the united states was the subject of an interference proceeding involving a patent application of a third party 
in addition  the company is seeking to provoke an interference by the united states patent and trademark office between another of its patent applications and an issued patent of a third party 
the company also believes that the united states patent and trademark office may declare an interference between one of its other patent applications and patent a application of a third party 
the company recently settled an interference proceeding involving an issued united states patent of a third party and one of the company s patent applications on file in the united states 
the third party conceded as part of the settlement that the subject matter of synaptic s patent application had priority over the subject matter of its patent 
as a consequence  synaptic will be issued a patent covering the subject matter and the third party s patent will be revoked 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of the pending opposition proceeding  the other interference proceeding and the anticipated interference proceedings will be favorable to the company 
in the event that the outcome of the opposition proceeding were unfavorable to the company  the company would not be issued the patent in the country in which the proceeding is taking place and would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing the subject matter of the opposed application in that country 
moreover  the opponent may  whether or not the outcome of the opposition proceeding is favorable to the company  seek to file similar oppositions in other countries 
in the event that the outcome of the interference proceedings were unfavorable to the company  the company might not be able to practice the subject matter of the relevant patent applications in the united states 
accordingly  an unfavorable outcome in any such proceeding would have an adverse effect on the company 
even if the eventual outcome of the pending opposition and interference proceedings and the anticipated interference proceedings were favorable to the company  the company s participation in them could result in substantial cost to the company 
further  no assurance can be given that patents issued to the company will not be infringed  invalidated or circumvented by others  or that the rights granted thereunder will be commercially valuable or will provide competitive advantages to the company and its present or future collaborative partners or licensees 
moreover  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  because patent applications in certain other countries generally are not published until more than eighteen months after they are filed and because publication of technological developments in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such developments  the company cannot be certain that it was the first to invent the subject matter covered by its patents or patent applications or that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
the field of gene discovery has become intensely competitive 
a number of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions have significantly expanded their gene discovery efforts in recent years and have filed patent applications or received patents covering their gene discoveries 
some of these applications or patents may be competitive with the company s applications or conflict in certain respects with claims made under the company s applications 
there can be no assurance that  in the event of any conflict  the company will be in a priority position with respect to inventorship on any of these applications 
the commercial success of the company also depends on the company s ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
the company is aware of a large number of patents and patent applications of third parties that contain claims to genes that code for g protein coupled receptors and or compounds that interact with g protein coupled receptors 
patents issued to others may preclude the company from using or licensing its technology or may preclude the company or its collaborative partners and licensees from commercializing drugs developed with the use of the company s technology 
the company has acquired a license to use certain technologies covered by a patent owned by columbia university 
the columbia university license is a worldwide non exclusive license to manufacture  use  sell and sublicense drugs derived from the use of certain recombinant dna technology 
in consideration for such license  the company has agreed to pay royalties on sales of drugs developed through the use of such license 
the term of the license extends until the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights covered by the license 
the company may be required to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of other parties in order to pursue its own technologies 
no assurance can be given that any such additional licenses would be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the failure to obtain such licenses could result in delays in the company s or its collaborative partners activities  including the development  manufacture or sale of drugs requiring such licenses  or preclude such development  manufacture or sale 
in some cases  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to assert infringement claims against others  to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property rights owned by the company  or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties 
such litigation could result in substantial costs to and diversion of resources by the company and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patents would ultimately be held valid or that efforts to defend any of its patents  trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property rights would be successful 
an adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to cease using the subject technology or require the company to license the subject technology from the third party  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition to patent protection  the company relies upon trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain its competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of its trade secrets and proprietary information  the company requires its employees  consultants and collaborative partners to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with the company 
in the case of employees  the agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed by them while in the employ of the company will be the exclusive property of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies in the event of any such breach or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or developed independently by others 
competition the company operates in a field in which new developments occur and are expected to continue to occur at a rapid pace 
competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  joint ventures  academic and other research institutions and others is intense and is expected to increase 
although the company believes that the elements of its human receptor targeted drug design technology and the manner in which the company has integrated these elements are proprietary to the company  one or more of such elements are currently employed by many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in their drug discovery efforts 
moreover  there are other companies with drug discovery programs at least some of the objectives of which are the same as or similar to those of the company 
the company is aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are engaged in efforts to develop compounds that interact with g protein coupled receptors subtypes  including receptor subtypes with which the company is working 
many of the company s competitors are large biotechnology companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies who may employ in such activities greater financial and other resources  including larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations  than the company or its collaborative partners 
the company also expects to encounter significant competition with respect to the drugs that it and its collaborative partners and licensees plan to develop 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage 
in order to compete successfully  the company s goal is to obtain patent protection for its gene discoveries and drug discovery systems and to make these systems available to pharmaceutical companies through collaborative and licensing arrangements for use in discovering drugs for major markets which have historically been difficult to address using the traditional approach to drug discovery 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will obtain patents covering its technology that protect it against competitors 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies that circumvent the company s technology or that such competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective than those developed by the company and its collaborative partners and licensees or that would render technology or drugs of the company and its collaborators and licensees less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitors of the company will not obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs more rapidly than the company and its collaborative partners and licensees  thereby rendering the company s and its collaborative partners and licensees drugs noncompetitive or obsolete 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit the company s or its collaborative partners and licensees ability to use the company s technology or commercialize its or their drugs 
government regulation the development  manufacturing and marketing of drugs developed through the use of the company s technology are subject to regulation by numerous federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  the principal one of which is the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries each of such federal  state  local and other authorities and agencies  a regulatory agency 
regulatory agencies impose mandatory procedures and standards for the conduct of certain preclinical testing and clinical trials and the production and marketing of drugs for human therapeutic use 
product development and approval of a new drug are likely to take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required by the fda before new drugs may be marketed in the united states include i preclinical studies  ii the submission to the fda of a request for authorization to conduct clinical trials on an investigational new drug an ind  iii adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended use  iv submission to the fda of a new drug application an nda  and v review and approval of the nda by the fda 
in the united states  preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation 
laboratories involved in preclinical testing must comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practices 
preclinical testing results are submitted to the fda as part of the ind and are reviewed by the fda prior to the commencement of human clinical trials 
unless the fda objects to an ind  the ind will become effective days following its receipt by the fda 
there can be no assurance that submission of an ind will result in the commencement of human clinical trials 
clinical trials  which involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator  are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap with one another 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board the irb at the institution where the study will be conducted 
the irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution 
compounds must be formulated according to the fda s gmp 
phase i clinical trials represent the initial administration of the investigational drug to a small group of healthy human subjects or  more rarely  to a group of selected patients with the targeted disease or disorder 
the goal of phase i clinical trials is typically to test for safety adverse effects  dose tolerance  absorption  bio distribution  metabolism  excretion and clinical pharmacology and  if possible  to gain early evidence regarding efficacy 
phase ii clinical trials involve a small sample of the actual intended patient population and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications  to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
once an investigational drug is found to have some efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population  phase iii clinical trials are initiated to establish further clinical safety and efficacy of the investigational drug in a broader sample of the general patient population at geographically dispersed study sites in order to determine the overall risk benefit ratio of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for all physician labeling 
the results of the research and product development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  clinical trials and related information are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda for approval of the marketing and shipment of the drug 
timetables for the various phases of clinical trials and nda approval cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the company  its collaborative partners or licensees or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
even assuming that clinical trials are completed and that an nda is submitted to the fda  there can be no assurance that the nda will be reviewed by the fda in a timely manner or that once reviewed  the nda will be approved 
the approval process is affected by a number of factors  including the severity of the targeted indications  the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials 
the fda may deny an nda if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or may require additional testing or information with respect to the investigational drug 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could also delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approval 
even if initial fda approval is obtained  further studies  including post market studies  may be required in order to provide additional data on safety and will be required in order to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested 
the fda will also require post market reporting and may require surveillance programs to monitor the side effects of the drug 
results of post marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the drug 
further  if there are any modifications to the drug  including changes in indication  manufacturing process or labeling  an nda supplement may be required to be submitted to the fda 
finally  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of drug development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval for a compound 
moreover  because most of the company s collaborative partners are generally responsible for preclinical testing  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing and commercialization of drugs  the ability to obtain and the timing of regulatory approvals are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory framework described above will not change or that additional regulations will not arise that may affect approval of a potential drug 
each manufacturing establishment for new drugs is required to receive some form of approval by the fda 
among the conditions for such approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to gmp  which must be followed at all times 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
manufacturing establishments  both foreign and domestic  are also subject to inspections by or under the authority of the fda and may be subject to inspections by foreign and other federal  state or local agencies 
prior to the commencement of marketing a product in other countries  approval by the regulatory agencies in such countries is required  regardless of whether fda approval has been obtained for such product 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals vary widely from country to country  and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than the time required for fda approval 
although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain european countries  in general  each country has its own procedures and requirements 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could adversely affect the marketing of any drugs developed by the company or its collaborative partners or licensees  impose costly procedures upon the company s or its collaborative partners or licensees activities  diminish any competitive advantages that the company or its collaborative partners or licensees may attain and adversely affect the company s ability to receive revenues or royalties 
there can be no assurance that  even after such time and expenditures  regulatory agency approvals will be obtained for any compounds developed by  in collaboration with or pursuant to licenses from the company 
moreover  even if regulatory agency approval for a compound is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
further  approved drugs and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on such drug or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the drug from the market 
regulatory agency approval of prices is required in many countries and may be required for the marketing of any drug developed by the company or its collaborative partners or licensees 
as with many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  the company s activities involve the use of radioactive compounds and hazardous materials 
the company is subject to local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to occupational safety  laboratory practices  the use  handling and disposition of radioactive materials  environmental protection and hazardous substance control 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of radioactive compounds and other hazardous materials used in its research and development activities comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of any such accident  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
employees as of march   the company had full time employees  of whom hold phd or phd degrees 
of the company s full time employees  were engaged directly in scientific research and were engaged in general and administrative functions 
the company s scientific staff members have diversified experience and expertise in molecular and cell biology  biochemistry  molecular pharmacology  medicinal  structural  combinatorial and computer assisted chemistry and information systems 
all employees have entered into agreements with the company pursuant to which they are prohibited from disclosing to third parties the company s proprietary information and assign to the company all rights to inventions made by them during their employment with the company 
the company s employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
item properties the company leases laboratory and office space in a facility at college road in paramus  new jersey 
the company recently entered into an amendment to its lease which extended the term through the year and increased its leased space to up to  square feet 
the company is currently converting a portion of its space into additional research laboratories and may renovate other portions of its space in for additional laboratories and offices 
the company believes that the space it currently leases is adequate to accommodate the anticipated administrative and research needs of the company for the foreseeable future

it is utilizing this technology both to discover and clone the genes that code for human receptor subtypes associated with specific disorders and to design compounds that can potentially be developed as drugs for treating these disorders 
during  the company was engaged in collaborations with four pharmaceutical companies eli lilly and company  merck co  inc  novartis pharma ag and the warner lambert company 
since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and through funds provided by its collaborative partners lilly  merck and novartis under collaborative agreements 
the company also granted a nonexclusive license to use certain of its technology to dupont merck which license expired on february  under its collaborative agreements  the company may receive one or two types of revenue from its collaborative partners contract revenue and license revenue 
contract revenue includes research funding to support a specified number of the company s scientists and payments upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones 
research funding revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the agreement to which it relates and is based upon predetermined funding requirements 
research milestone payment revenue is recognized when the related research milestone is achieved 
license revenue represents non refundable payments for licenses to the company s technology and drug discovery systems 
non refundable payments for licenses are recognized at such time as they are received or  if earlier  become guaranteed 
in addition to contract revenue and license revenue  if a drug is developed as a result of any of the collaborative agreements between the company and its collaborative partners  the company is entitled to receive royalty payments based upon the sale of such drugs 
the company also receives revenues from government grants under the small business innovative research sbir program of the national institutes of health 
to date  the company s expenditures have been for research and development related expenses  general and administrative related expenses  fixed asset purchases and various patent related expenditures incurred in protecting the company s technologies 
the company has been historically unprofitable and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for a significant number of years and may not become profitable  if at all  until it begins to receive royalty revenue 
to date  the company has not received any royalty revenue and does not expect to receive such revenue for a significant number of years  if at all 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenues 
the company recognized revenue of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  from to was attributable primarily to an increase in contract revenue of  resulting from the expansion of the company s collaborative arrangement with lilly and increases in rates charged per full time equivalent scientist under collaborative arrangements from which the company receives research funding partially offset by a decrease of  of non recurring license revenue under the terms of one of the company s license and collaboration agreements during the third quarter of the increase of  from to was attributable primarily to the recognition of the  of license revenue from one of the company s collaborative partners and an increase of  of grant revenue over the comparable period in  both of which were partially offset by a decrease of contract revenue of  this decrease in contract revenue was attributable primarily to the receipt in of a one time  payment from one of the company s collaborative partners for the achievement of a specific milestone that was partially offset by increases in in the rates charged to the company s collaborative partners per full time equivalent scientist 
research and development expenses 
the company incurred research and development expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to an increase of  in compensation expense resulting from an increase in average headcount year to year  annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expenses  an increase of  in research supply costs  and an increase of  in facility related costs 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to an increase of  in compensation expense resulting from an increase in average headcount year to year  annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense  as well as an increase in amortization of deferred compensation  an increase of  in research supply costs  an increase of  in research equipment costs related to research funded by government grants   in increased depreciation expense  and an increase of  in software license fees 
general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to an increase in patent and patent related expenses resulting from increased patent related activities and the expensing of all patent and patent application costs as incurred  effective october  the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to an increase of  in expenses associated with being a public company  an increase of  in compensation expense resulting from an increase in average headcount and annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense  an increase of  in patent and patent related costs  and an increase of  in certain supply and computer related expenses 
other income  net 
the company received other income  net of interest expense  of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  from to in other income  net of interest expense  was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in the average cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balance resulting from the company s initial public offering in december net loss and net loss per share 
the net loss incurred by the company was  per share   per share and  per share for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  in net loss from to was primarily attributable to the recognition during of  of non recurring license revenue offset by higher total expenses 
the decrease of  in net loss from to was attributable primarily to the increase of  of non recurring license revenue and other income  offset by higher total expenses 
operating trends 
it is expected that research funding from existing collaborations will decrease from  in to  in it is also expected that operating expenses will increase in order to further support existing collaborations and internal research efforts 
operating expenses are expected to continue to grow  at a minimum  consistent with historical trends 
patent related expenditures are expected to grow at a rate that is faster than the historical operating expense growth rate 
other income  net is expected to decline in and as existing funds are utilized to support the company s operations 
property and equipment costs are expected to continue to increase as the company s currently underutilized space is converted into laboratory space 
management has performed a review of the computer hardware and software components that the company currently utilizes in order to determine the impact that the year issue will have on the company s future operating results  future financial condition and on the future operations of its business 
based on the results of the review  management has concluded that the impact the year issue will have on the aforementioned will be immaterial 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated  and  respectively 
the increase of  was attributable primarily to the receipt of  in net proceeds raised in a public offering offset by cash used in operations of  and capital expenditures of  to date  the company has met its cash requirements through the sale of its stock  through licensing fees  research funding and milestone payments received under the collaborative agreements with lilly  merck and novartis  through sbir grants and through interest earned on its investments 
as of december   the company had received  from the sale of its stock   in licensing fees  research funding and milestone payments under its collaborative agreements   in sbir grants  and  in other income  net 
to date  the portion of these funds that has been expended by the company has been used principally to fund research and development  to purchase fixed assets used primarily in its research activities  to create its patent estate and to pay general and administrative support costs 
at december   the company was involved in collaborative arrangements with lilly  merck  novartis and warner lambert 
lilly  merck and novartis provided research funding to the company during and are expected to provide research funding to the company during the aggregate amount of research funding under these arrangements which the company expects to receive during is  warner lambert does not currently provide research funding to the company and the company does not expect that such funding will be provided  if at all  until research funding under the lilly agreement is scheduled to expire on december  research funding under the merck agreement is scheduled to expire on november  research funding under the novartis agreement is scheduled to expire on august  at december   the company had invested an aggregate of  in property and equipment 
the company continues to convert currently underutilized space into laboratory facilities beyond the level which existed at december  in november  the company extended its lease agreement  which was due to expire on december   until december  the minimum annual payment under the lease is currently  a standby letter of credit for  has been issued to the company s landlord as a security deposit and is secured by investment securities of the company which are  to the extent of  recorded in the balance sheet as restricted cash 
this standby letter of credit must be renewed annually during the life of the lease 
at december   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company intends to utilize these funds primarily to conduct its current and future research programs  for general corporate purposes and to make leasehold improvements to its facilities beyond the level which existed on december  it is anticipated that the company will continue to incur significant operating losses for a number of years and will require the use of cash to finance its capital programs 
the company believes that its cash on hand  together with the funds that it expects to receive from its collaborative partners  interest income and funds received under sbir grants  will be sufficient to fund an increased operating expense level and an increased level of capital spending through the year the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for a number of years 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes that will expire principally in the years through in addition  the company had research and development credit carryforwards which will expire principally in through for financial reporting purposes  a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
due to limitations imposed by the tax reform act of  and as a result of a significant change in the company s ownership in and  the utilization of  of net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the utilization of the research and development credits is similarly limited

all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
early stage of product development  technological uncertainty since its inception in january  the company has focused its activities on the discovery and cloning of receptor genes and the use of such genes as tools in the design of precisely targeted compounds for a broad range of therapeutic applications 
to date  the company has not completed development of any drugs alone or in collaboration with its partners and does not expect that any drugs resulting from its or its collaborative partners or licensees research and development efforts will be commercially available for a significant number of years  if at all 
all compounds discovered by the company and its collaborative partners and licensees will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
extensive preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy will take several years  and the time required to commercialize new drugs cannot be predicted with accuracy 
moreover  potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may never reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that potential products are found during preclinical testing or clinical trials to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects  that they fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  that they are difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale  that they fail to achieve market acceptance or that they are precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s approach to drug discovery  its research and development efforts or the efforts of lilly  merck  novartis  warner lambert  grunenthal or glaxo  or any future collaborative partner or licensee of the company  will result in the development of any drugs  or that any drugs  if successfully developed  will be proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials  receive required regulatory approvals  be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully commercialized 
product development of new pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain  and unanticipated developments  including clinical or regulatory delays  unexpected adverse effects and inadequate therapeutic efficacy  would slow or prevent product development efforts of the company and its collaborative partners and licensees and have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
dependence on collaborative partners and licensees for development  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and other resources a key element of the company s business strategy is to leverage resources by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies 
under the collaborative agreements with lilly  merck  novartis and warner lambert  the company s collaborative partners are each responsible for conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and commercializing any resulting drugs 
under the grunenthal agreement  grunenthal is responsible for conducting certain preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology 
the company has no involvement in the research and development activities of glaxo under the glaxo agreement 
as a result  the company s receipt of revenues whether in the form of drug development milestones  royalties on sales or net sales proceeds in respect of drugs resulting from its collaborative and licensing arrangements is dependent upon the activities of its collaborative partners and licensees 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by the company s collaborative partners to their respective collaborations with the company and by the company s licensee to the development of drugs that would be subject to royalties payable to the company are not within the company s control 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the interests of the company will continue to coincide with those of its collaborative partners or licensee  that some of the company s collaborative partners or the company s licensee will not develop independently or with third parties drugs that could compete with drugs of the types covered by their arrangements with the company  or that disagreements over rights or technology or other proprietary interests will not occur 
if any of the company s collaborative partners or the company s licensee breaches its agreement with the company  or fails to devote adequate resources to or conduct in a timely manner its collaborative or licensed activities  the research programs under the applicable collaborative agreement or the development and commercialization of drug candidates subject to such arrangement could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative or licensing arrangements will be successful 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into acceptable collaborative or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies in the future  or that  if negotiated  such arrangements will be successful 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception in january at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with the company s research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses at least over the next several years and expects losses to increase as the company s research and development efforts expand and its current collaborative arrangements expire 
as of december   the only revenues generated by the company had resulted from payments under the collaborative agreements  and government grants under the sbir program of the national institutes of health 
the company s revenues  expenses and losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research payments under the lilly agreement  the merck agreement and the novartis agreements are scheduled to expire in december  november and august  respectively  unless the research programs under such agreements are extended by mutual agreement of the company and lilly  merck or novartis 
the company does not expect to achieve revenues or royalties from sales of drugs for a number of years  if at all 
the company will not achieve revenues or royalties from drug sales unless it or one of its collaborative partners or licensees successfully completes clinical trials with respect to a drug candidate  obtains regulatory approvals for that drug candidate and commercializes the resulting drug 
failure to achieve significant revenue or profitable operations could impair the company s ability to sustain operations and there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the operation of the company s business requires substantial capital resources and such requirements are likely to increase in the future 
the company s future financial requirements will depend on many factors  including the continued progress of its research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  if any  of its drug candidates  the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its or its collaborative partners proposed products and the status of competitive products 
the company s capital requirements will also depend on the company s ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others and whether its future collaborative partners provide research funding to the company and are responsible for all development activities  preclinical testing and regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  the manufacturing and marketing of products 
in addition  such capital requirements will depend on the time and expense associated with filing and  if necessary  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims 
the company entered into the grunenthal agreement in january under this agreement  the company will retain certain ownership rights to any products that result from the collaboration 
in addition  the company will be significantly involved in the development of any such potential products but may also be required to contribute substantial financial resources towards such development 
accordingly  the cost to the company of this arrangement may be significantly greater than the cost to it of participating in a royalty based collaboration 
the company intends to explore the possibility of entering into additional collaborative arrangements similar in nature to its collaboration with grunenthal 
no assurance can be given that the company s existing cash on hand and marketable securities and funds it will receive under the collaborative agreements and under the glaxo agreement and government grants  together with interest income  will be sufficient 
the company expects that it will  in the future  seek to raise additional funding from other sources  including other collaborative partners and licensees  and through public or private financings  including sales of equity or debt securities 
any such collaborative or licensing arrangement could result in limitations on the company s ability to control the research and development of potential drugs and the commercialization of resulting drugs  if any  as well as its profits therefrom 
any such equity financing could result in dilution to the company s then existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on favorable terms or at all  or that such funds  if raised  would be sufficient to permit the company to continue to conduct its operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly or eliminate one or more of its receptor or drug discovery programs 
uncertainties related to clinical trials before obtaining required regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development  the company or its collaborators and licensees must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that such product is safe and efficacious for use 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results that will be obtained from large scale clinical trials  and there can be no assurance that clinical trials of any product under development will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product or will result in a marketable product 
the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development by the company or its collaborative partners and licensees must be supported by extensive data from clinical trials 
a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory agency may require additional clinical trials  which could result in increased costs and significant development delays 
the rate of completion of clinical trials of the company s or its collaborative partners and licensees products is dependent upon  among other factors  obtaining adequate clinical supplies and the rate of patient accrual 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in planned patient enrollment in clinical trials may result in increased costs  program delays or both  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s collaborative partners and licensees generally have the right to control the planning and execution of product development and clinical programs  and there can be no assurance that such partners and licensees will conduct such programs in accordance with schedules that are satisfactory to the company 
there can be no assurance that  if clinical trials are completed  the company or its collaborative partners and licensees will submit ndas with respect to any potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the fda in a timely manner  if at all 
lack of manufacturing experience  reliance on contract manufacturers the company currently has no manufacturing facilities and relies on its collaborative partners or other manufacturers to produce its compounds for research and development  preclinical and clinical purposes 
the products under development by the company and its collaborative partners have never been manufactured on a commercial scale and there can be no assurance that such products can be manufactured at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
if the company were unable to contract for a sufficient supply of its compounds on acceptable terms  or if it should encounter delays or difficulties in its relationships with manufacturers  the company s preclinical and clinical testing schedule would be delayed  resulting in delay in the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  manufacturers that the company may use must adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if these facilities cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of the products will not be granted 
lack of sales and marketing capability the creation of infrastructure to commercialize pharmaceutical products is a difficult  expensive and time consuming process 
synaptic currently has no sales or marketing capability 
to market directly any product it may develop  the company will need to establish a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and distribution capability or contract with other pharmaceutical and or health care companies with distribution systems and direct sales forces 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish direct or indirect sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance for licensing arrangements 
to the extent that the company enters into co promotion or licensing arrangements  any revenues received by the company will be dependent on the efforts of third parties  and there can be no assurance that any such efforts will be successful 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on its management and scientific staff 
loss of the services of any key individual could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain highly talented managerial and scientific personnel and consultants 
the company faces intense competition for such personnel from  among others  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to attract and retain the personnel it requires on acceptable terms
