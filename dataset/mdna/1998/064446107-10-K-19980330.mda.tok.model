results of operations the company reported net earnings available to common stockholders of million per basic common share  computed on the basis of  basic weighted average common shares outstanding and per diluted common share  computed on the basis of  diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  this compares to net losses available to common stockholders of million per basic common share  computed on the basis of  basic weighted average common shares outstanding and per diluted common share  computed on the basis of  diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  reflect a decreased operating expenses of million primarily due to lower fdic insurance costs of million resulting from the special one time saif recapitalization payment of million in the third quarter of and an upgrade in the bank s assessment classification  b increased income tax benefit of million see income taxes  c decreased provisions for estimated loan and reo losses of million and d and increased noninterest income of million related to higher volumes of uninsured investment product sales  mbss sales and deposit and atm cash services activities 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a decreased net interest income of million primarily due to lower rates on average interest earning assets and higher levels of average borrowing balances and b the writedown of the libor asset trust securities of million due to the credit deterioration of the securities underlying collateral 
the company reported a net loss available to common stockholders of million per basic and diluted common share  computed on the basis of  basic weighted average common shares outstanding and per diluted common share  computed on the basis of  diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  without the saif special assessment of million  the company would have reported earnings available to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  this compares to a net loss of million per basic common share  computed on the basis of  basic weighted average common shares outstanding and per diluted common share  computed on the basis of  diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  results of operations for the year ended december   excluding the saif special assessment of million  as compared to the same period in  reflect a a decrease in provisions for loan losses of million due in part to the loan portfolio charge of million which was a consequence of the adoption of the accelerated asset resolution plan  with no comparable amount in  and the reduction of npas during  b increased net interest income of million due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities and utilization of the capital raised in and c an increase of million in income tax benefits resulting from the filing of various amended federal income tax returns to reflect a specified liability loss carryback under internal revenue code irc section f 
these favorable changes were partially offset by  a decreased gains on sales of loans  investment securities and mbss of million  b a gain on sale of servicing of million in with no comparable amounts in  c decreased loan fee income of million primarily due to the sale of servicing in  and d preferred stock dividends of the bank of million with no comparable amounts in acquisitions on july   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of hancock  which had five branches  assets of approximately million and deposits of approximately million at june  the company acquired all of the stock of hancock in exchange for  shares of bank plus common stock in a transaction valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of hancock was accounted for as a purchase and was reflected in the consolidated statement of condition of the company at june  the company s consolidated statements of operations include the revenues and expenses of the acquired business beginning july  the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased including identifiable intangible assets and the liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition 
the company identified a core deposit intangible of approximately million  which will be amortized over seven years  the estimated average life of the deposits acquired 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired amounted to approximately million  which has been accounted for as goodwill and will be amortized over years using the straight line method 
on september   the company completed the purchase of deposits from coast 
the coast branch  located in westwood  california  had deposits of approximately million at september  the company identified a core deposit intangible of approximately million  which will be amortized over seven years  the estimated average life of the deposits acquired 
the acquisitions of hancock and the coast branch provide a number of benefits to the company including an increased customer base and larger branch network and operating efficiencies through consolidation 
the acquired branch network and associated customer base included approximately  and  transaction and time deposit accounts  respectively  and will provide new territory in which to implement fidelity s sales platform of credit and investment products 
through strategic alliances with third party providers  the company will introduce to the acquired customer base a wide range of securities  insurance and consumer loan products to enhance the company s fee income 
the company has reduced consolidated operating expenses as a result of the merger through the closure and consolidation of the administrative office of hancock and the consolidation of two of the branches acquired into existing fidelity branches 
writedown of mortgage backed securities as of september   the company transferred two securities with a total amortized cost of million and a total estimated fair value of million from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the transfer was the result of significant deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrowers of the underlying loans collateralizing the securities 
the unrealized holding loss of million at september  was reported in a separate component of shareholders equity as the decline in fair value was not believed to be other than temporary 
the continued poor performance of the securities underlying collateral in the three months subsequent to september  motivated management to seek a buyer for the securities rather than risk possible continued decline in fair value 
the securities were sold in january at a loss of million  which was recorded through earnings in as the loss was now considered to be other than temporary 
asset growth as a part of the business strategy in  the company developed a plan to grow assets loans and securities by approximately million 
this plan  in general terms  was based upon certain risk adjusted return and liquidity objectives and was designed to increase the company s securities and loan portfolios to enhance the company s earning capabilities 
under this plan  the company purchased billion in investment and mbss and million in single family whole loans in the asset growth was primarily funded through fhlb advances 
the increase in earning assets generally had lower interest rate spreads than the company s existing assets  see asset liability management for a discussion on the company s interest rate spread for the year ended and the change from the year ended asset liability management net interest income is the difference between interest earned on the company s loans  mbss and investment securities interest earning assets and interest paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the rates earned on the company s interest earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative amounts of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average interest rate spread for the years ended december    and was  and  respectively 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to maximize the net income of the company while controlling interest rate risk exposure 
banks and savings institutions are subject to interest rate risk when assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times duration risk  against different indices basis risk or for different terms yield curve risk 
the decision to control or accept interest rate risk can only be made with an understanding of the probability of various scenarios occurring 
having liabilities that reprice more quickly than assets is beneficial when interest rates fall  but may be detrimental when interest rates rise 
the company manages interest rate risk by  among other things  maintaining a portfolio consisting primarily of arm loans 
arm loans comprised  of the total loan portfolio at december   and at december   and the percentage of monthly adjustable arms to total loans was approximately   and at december    and  respectively 
interest sensitive assets provide the company with a degree of long term protection from rising interest rates 
at december   approximately of fidelity s total loan portfolio consisted of loans which mature or reprice within one year  compared to approximately at december  and at december  fidelity has in recent periods been negatively impacted by the fact that increases in the interest rates accruing on fidelity s arms lagged the increases in interest rates accruing on its deposits due to reporting delays and contractual look back periods contained in the bank s loan documents 
at december   of the bank s loans  which are indexed to cofi at december   as with all cofi portfolios in the industry  do not reprice until some time after the industry liabilities composing cofi reprice 
the company s liabilities reprice generally in line with the cost of funds of institutions which comprise the fhlb eleventh district 
in the company s case  the lag between the repricing of its liabilities and its arm loans indexed to cofi is approximately four months 
thus  in a rising rate environment there will be upward pressure on rates paid on deposit accounts and wholesale borrowings  and the company s net interest income will be adversely affected until the majority of its interest earning assets fully reprice 
conversely  in a falling interest rate environment  net interest income will be positively affected 
the company utilizes various financial instruments in the normal course of its business 
by their nature all such instruments involve risk  and the maximum potential loss may exceed the value at which such instruments are carried 
as is customary for these types of instruments  the company usually does not require collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments 
the company manages its credit exposure to counterparties through credit approvals  credit limits and other monitoring procedures 
the company s credit policy committee makes recommendations regarding counterparties and credit limits which are subject to approval by the board of directors 
the company may employ interest rate swaps  caps and floors in the management of interest rate risk 
an interest rate swap agreement is a financial transaction where two counterparties agree to exchange different streams of payments over time 
an interest rate swap involves no exchange of principal either at inception or upon maturity  rather  it involves the periodic exchange of interest payments arising from an underlying notional principal amount 
interest rate caps and floors generally involve the payment of a one time premium to a counterparty who  if interest rates rise or fall  above or below a predetermined level  will make payments to the company at an agreed upon rate for the term of the agreement until such time as interest rates fall below or rise above the cap or floor level 
during the first quarter of  the bank terminated interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million  resulting in a deferred gain of million which was fully amortized in also  during the fourth quarter of  the bank terminated its remaining interest swap agreements  which were entered into in and  with a notional amount of million and as a result recorded a deferred loss of million that is being amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the original transactions 
these interest rate swap agreements were intended to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities 
in the bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to convert a fixed rate fhlb advance to a floating rate 
the swap was terminated in the fourth quarter of and as a result recorded a deferred gain of million that is being amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the fhlb advance 
the following table sets out the maturity and rate sensitivity of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  gap  as reflected in the table  represents the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods as adjusted for interest rate swaps and other financial instruments as applicable  and based on certain assumptions  including those stated in the notes to the table

investment securities include fhlb stock of million 
arms and variable rate borrowings from the fhlb system fhlb advances are primarily in the shorter categories as they are subject to interest rate adjustments 
these liabilities are subject to daily adjustments and are therefore included in the within months category 
analysis of the gap provides only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
the actual impact of interest rate movements on the company s net interest income may differ from that implied by any gap measurement 
the actual impact on net interest income may depend on the direction and magnitude of the interest rate movement  as well as competitive and market pressures 
other derivative instruments during the third quarter of  the company entered into an advisory agreement with an investment advisor  pursuant to which the advisor will recommend trading related investments  subject to prior approval and direction of the company  and execute trading activities in accordance with the company s investment strategy 
such strategy includes the use of derivative instruments for trading or yield enhancement purposes 
realized and unrealized changes in fair values of the instruments are recognized in earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
under the advisory agreement  outstanding forward commitments to purchase and sell adjustable rate mbss totaled million and million  respectively  at december  also outstanding in relation to this managed portfolio at december   were million notional amount of interest rate caps which will mature in  million notional amount interest rate swaps which will mature in and million notional amount of call options on treasury futures with an exercise date in in  as part of the growth strategy  the company purchased approximately million in fixed rate us agency mbss  which were categorized as available for sale 
due to the higher price volatility of fixed rate securities during interest rate fluctuations as compared to adjustable rate securities  management began a strategy to hedge the fluctuations of the fair value of the fixed rate mbss 
the company used futures on treasury notes which have a high correlation with agency mbss 
outstanding at december  were million notional amount of futures on treasury notes 
the derivative instruments used to hedge the fluctuations in fair values of available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with realized and unrealized changes in fair value reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized changes in fair value are amortized as a yield adjustment over the life of the hedged instrument 
market risk the company s alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the company s asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the company s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained one hundred to four hundred basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
the interest rate risk policy of the fidelity board establishes maximum decreases in npv of   and in the event of sudden and sustained one hundred to four hundred basis point increases in market rates 
the policy also establishes maximum decreases in npv of   and in the event of sudden and sustained one hundred to four hundred basis point decreases in market rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of december  net portfolio value at december  net portfolio value as a of portfolio value assets dollar dollar percent board net portfolio basis point rate shock amount change change limit value ratio change dollars in millions base case the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of an increase in prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to decrease  and that in the event of a decrease in prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to increase 
at december   the company s estimated changes in npv were within the targets established by the board of directors 
npv is calculated by the company pursuant to the guidelines established by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of december   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
asset quality general the company s loan portfolio is primarily secured by assets located in southern california and is comprised principally of single family and multifamily units or more residential loans 
at december   of fidelity s real estate loan portfolio consisted of california single family residences  while another and consisted of california multifamily dwellings of to units and or more units  respectively 
at december   of fidelity s real estate loan portfolio including loans held for sale consisted of california single family residences while another and consisted of california multifamily dwellings of to units and or more units  respectively 
the performance of the company s loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties has been adversely affected by southern california economic conditions 
these portfolios are particularly susceptible to the potential for further declines in the southern california economy  such as increasing vacancy rates  declining rents  increasing interest rates  declining debt coverage ratios  and declining market values for multifamily and commercial properties 
in addition  the possibility that investors may abandon properties or seek bankruptcy protection with respect to properties experiencing negative cash flow  particularly where such properties are not cross collateralized by other performing assets  can also adversely affect the multifamily loan portfolio 
there can be no assurances that current improved economic indicators will have a material impact on the bank s portfolio in the near future as many factors key to recovery may be impacted adversely by the federal reserve board s interest rate policy as well as other factors 
the bank s internal asset review process reviews the quality and recoverability of each of those assets which exhibit credit risk to the bank based on delinquency and other criteria in order to establish adequate gva and sva 
see item business credit loss experience 
accelerated asset resolution plan an important component of the company s business strategy is the reduction of risk in the bank s loan and reo portfolios 
in the fourth quarter of  the bank adopted the plan  which was designed to aggressively dispose of  resolve or otherwise manage a pool the aarp pool of primarily multifamily loans and reo that at that time were considered by the bank to have higher risk of future nonperformance or impairment relative to the remainder of the bank s multifamily loan portfolio 
the plan reflected both acceleration in estimated timing of asset resolution  as well as a potential change in recovery method from the normal course of business 
in an effort to maximize recovery on loans and reo included in the aarp pool  the plan allowed for a range of possible methods of resolution including  but not limited to  i individual loan restructuring  potentially including additional extensions of credit or write offs of existing principal  ii foreclosure and sale of collateral properties  iii securitization of loans  iv the bulk sale of loans and v bulk sale or accelerated disposition of reo properties 
the aarp pool originally consisted of assets with an aggregate gross book balance of approximately million  comprised of million in gross book balance of loans and million in gross book balance of reo 
as a consequence of the adoption of the plan  the bank recorded a million loan portfolio charge in the fourth quarter of  which was reflected as a credit to the bank s allowance for estimated loan and reo losses 
this amount represented the estimated additional losses  net of svas  anticipated to be incurred by the bank in executing the plan 
such additional losses represented  among other things  estimated reduced recoveries from restructuring loans and the acceptance of lower proceeds from the sale of individual reo and the estimated incremental losses associated with recovery through possible bulk sales of performing and nonperforming loans and reo 
in conjunction with the acquisition of hancock  the bank identified a pool of hancock assets  with similar risk profiles to the assets included in the bank s aarp pool  for inclusion in the plan 
the bank identified hancock assets with an aggregate gross book balance of approximately million  comprised of million in gross book balance of loans and million in gross book balance of reo 
simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition  hancock recorded million as an addition to the allowance for estimated loan losses representing the estimated reduced recoveries in executing the plan 
through december   i million in gross book balances of aarp pool loans had been resolved through either a negotiated sale or discounted payoff  ii million in gross book balances of aarp pool loans were collected through normal principal amortization or paid off through the normal course without loss  iii million in gross book balances of aarp pool loans had been modified or restructured and retained in the bank s mortgage portfolio  iv million in gross book balances of aarp pool loans were removed from the aarp pool upon management s determination that such assets no longer met the risk profile for inclusion in the aarp pool or that accelerated resolution of such assets was no longer appropriate and v million in gross book balances of reo were sold million in gross book balances of aarp pool loans were taken through foreclosure and acquired as reo since the inception of the aarp 
as of december   the aarp pool consisted of assets with an aggregate gross book balance of million  comprised of accruing and nonaccruing multifamily real estate loans totaling approximately million and reo properties totaling approximately million  which are reported as real estate owned on the statement of financial condition 
through december   of the million of reserves established in connection with the plan  including the million established by hancock  million had been charged off and million had been allocated to svas or reo writedowns in connection with the bank s estimate of recovery for aarp pool assets 
due to the addition of the hancock assets to the plan  it is anticipated that the remaining aarp pool will be resolved in notwithstanding the actions taken by the bank in implementing the plan  there can be no assurance that the aarp pool assets retained by the bank will not result in additional losses 
the bank s allowance for loan and reo losses and the svas established in connection with such assets are ultimately subjective and inherently uncertain 
there can be no assurance that further additions to the bank s allowance for loan and reo losses will not be required in the future in connection with such assets  which could have an adverse effect on the bank s financial condition  results of operations and levels of regulatory capital 
classified assets total classified assets decreased million or from december   to million at december  this decrease was due to lower levels of nonperforming and performing classified loans and the large volume of reo sales during  offset by an increase in other classified assets of million related to the classification of the libor asset trust securities due to the performance of the underlying collateral 
the ratio of npas to total assets decreased from at december   to at december  this decrease is due to both a decrease in the level of npas at december   compared to december  and to an increase in total assets at december  compared to december  all assets and ratios are reported net of sva and writedowns unless otherwise stated

because of numerous changes in both balances and rates  it is difficult to allocate precisely the effects thereof 
for purposes of these tables  the change due to volume is initially calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the average rate during the prior period and the change due to rate is calculated as the change in average rate multiplied by the average volume during the prior period

noninterest income expense noninterest income has three major components a noninterest income from ongoing operations  which includes loan fee income  gains or losses on loans held for sale  fees earned on the sale of uninsured investment products and annuities and retail banking fees  b income expenses associated with owned real estate  which includes both the provision for real estate losses as well as income expenses incurred by the company associated with the operations of its owned real estate properties and c gains and losses on the sales of loan servicing  investment securities and mbss 
items b and c can fluctuate widely  and could therefore mask the underlying fee generating performance of the company on an ongoing basis 
noninterest income increased by million from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the major component of this increase are a fee income from sale of uninsured investment products increased by million as a result of increased sales  b fee income on deposits and other income increased by million primarily as a result of a higher average volume of deposit balances in as compared to  c net gains on securities activities in the year ended december  increased by million from the twelve month period primarily due to increased sales  d fee income on americash increased million as a result of cash service fees received in  with no comparable amounts in and e decreased real estate operations of million primarily due to improved execution on sales of foreclosed properties 
these favorable variances were partially offset by the writedown of mbss of million see writedown of mortgage backed securities 
noninterest income decreased by million from net noninterest income of million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the major components of this decrease are a other noninterest income expense decreased by million as a result of a net gain of million realized in from the sale of million in rights to service loans for others  with no comparable amounts in  b loan servicing fees decreased by million primarily as a result of the sale of the rights to service loans in the first quarter of and the second quarter of  c net gains on sales of mbss decreased during the year ended december  by million from the twelve month period  and d net gains on securities activities in the year ended december  decreased by million from the twelve month period 
the increased sales activity in loans  mbss and investment securities in was primarily for regulatory capital maintenance purposes 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million including the saif special assessment of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to a a decrease of million of fdic insurance costs resulting from the special one time recapitalization payment of million to the saif in the third quarter of and an upgrade in the bank s assessment classification  b a decrease of million in other expenses primarily due to lower legal settlement costs related to certain litigation
