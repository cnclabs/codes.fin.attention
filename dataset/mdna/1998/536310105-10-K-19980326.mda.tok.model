the company is developing evacettm formerly tlc d  liposomal doxorubicin  as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer and potentially other cancers 
evacettm is currently in two phase iii clinical studies comparing it to conventional doxorubicin as a single agent and in combination with cyclophosphamide  another commonly used chemotherapeutic agent 
results of an interim analysis at the half way point of the studies indicate that evacettm is significantly less cardiotoxic than conventional doxorubicin with essentially equal efficacy 
if clinical results continue to be positive  the company expects to file a new drug application for evacettm with the us food and drug administration fda in the company is conducting preclinical toxicology studies of tlc ell liposomal ether lipid  a new cancer therapeutic that may have applications for the treatment of many different cancers 
if successful  the company expects to file an investigational new drug application with the fda and  if approved  to commence human clinical studies of tlc ell in late or early the company has a continuing discovery research program concentrating on oncology treatment and has a number of products in research 
these products include bromotaxol a hydrophobic derivative of paclitaxel  which has shown anticancer activity in several experimental models  ceramides and sphingosines molecules widely implicated in cell differentiation and apoptosis  certain of which the company has identified as displaying anticancer activity  and fusogenic liposomes liposomes specifically designed to fuse to cell membranes  which the company hopes to use for the efficient delivery of genes to their intended targets 
on june   the company announced results of a phase iii study of ventustm as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  an inflammatory condition affecting the lungs 
the company s analysis of the two arms of the study showed no significant difference between patients receiving ventustm or placebo either in reducing the time on mechanical ventilation or in day mortality 
no safety concerns for the drug were identified 
the company does not intend to perform any further significant development of ventustm for this indication but  instead  intends to make ventustm available for licensing to another company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued following the results of the ventustm study  the company announced its intention to focus its resources on the development of an oncology franchise 
as part of implementing this strategy  the company restructured its operations to reflect ongoing operating realities and to focus the organization on the development and marketing of oncology and related pharmaceuticals 
the restructuring eliminated positions  which resulted in unusual charges of  in the second quarter 
the annualized benefit of the restructuring is approximately  additionally  in order to gain operational access to a second  potentially significant oncology related drug  the company reacquired  on july   all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacettm from pfizer inc pfizer  which had previously been co developing evacettm with the company 
the company is assuming control and the cost of all clinical studies  including the ongoing phase iii clinical studies that were previously being conducted by pfizer 
pfizer will receive royalties on worldwide except japan commercial sales of evacettm 
in july and august  the company entered into agreements to settle patent litigation with the university of texas and md anderson cancer center ut and with nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc and fujisawa usa  inc 
under the ut settlement the company received an exclusive license under ut s patent and paid past royalties in a combination of cash and stock  agreed to pay royalties on future sales of abelcet  and issued to ut a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
under the nexstar settlement  the company received a payment of  and will receive quarterly payments based on all ambisome sales beginning in revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the primary components of revenues for the company are product sales of abelcet  which commenced in  collaborative research and development revenue  and interest  investment and other income 
the revenue growth is attributable to product sales of abelcet both in the us and internationally 
partially offsetting the sales increase in was the cessation of collaborative research and development revenue during the second half of as a result of the reacquisition of evacettm from pfizer 
revenues in were  an increase of  or over revenues of  the primary reason for the significant growth in was the launch and marketing of abelcet in the us and the further market penetration of abelcet internationally 
domestic and international net sales of abelcet for the past three years were fiscal year ended us international december    december    december    item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued domestic sales in grew by over during the second quarter of  the company instituted a targeted pricing program in response to a competitor  by offering discounts to high volume purchasers 
the price reduction is effected by chargebacks paid to wholesalers based on their sales at contract prices to targeted hospitals 
the impact of the program was that unit shipments increased by compared to the prior year 
us sales are also subject to rebates pursuant to government mandated price protection programs 
the company provides a reserve for the impact on sales of these rebates and chargebacks  and periodically evaluates the estimates used in establishing the reserve in order to make necessary adjustments 
the provision for the year ended december  was approximately in november  the company received clearance from the fda to market abelcet in the us domestic sales in were primarily to establish stocking inventory at drug wholesalers during the fourth quarter 
the substantial increase in us sales in was attributable to both the impact of a full year of sales and increasing product demand from hospitals and other purchasers 
internationally  the company has been approved to market abelcet in markets 
in addition  sales are realized on a named patient basis in certain countries where marketing approval has not yet been received 
in the us  the us and canada  the company markets abelcet with its own sales force 
for other countries  the company s general strategy is to market abelcet through marketing partners  with specific marketing and distribution alliances being determined on a country by country basis as future market approvals are received 
international sales were  for the year ended december   or  higher than the comparable prior year period 
the majority of the increase was the result of growth throughout international markets including launches of abelcet in france  italy and canada 
while the company s marketing partner in spain reduced purchases of abelcet in  in the market sales in spain continued to have significant growth 
the company s international performance was also adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates due to the strong us dollar 
collaborative research and development revenues were   and  for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the revenue decline of  or in from is due to the cessation of development funding by pfizer pursuant to the july  agreement in which the company reacquired all development  manufacturing and marketing rights to evacettm from pfizer 
the revenue decline during was due to the progression of evacettm into phase iii clinical studies that were being conducted and directly funded by pfizer 
during  the company also earned revenues from schering ag of  pursuant to a development agreement for a diagnostic imaging agent 
this agreement is no longer in force  and all rights to the agent have been returned to the company 
interest  investment and other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  is primarily due to the receipt of a payment of  from nexstar pharmaceuticals  inc as part of the settlement of patent litigation  partially offset by lower interest and investment income due to smaller average cash balances available for investment in the company s portfolio during interest  investment and other income was greater in compared to the period 
this increase is primarily due to foreign exchange gains recognized in combined with realized losses on the sale of certain investments in the first quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although sales of abelcetr in the us have grown in each of the past three fiscal years  and the company expects to have continued sales growth  the company may experience period to period sales fluctuations in the future 
in the us  two competing lipid based amphotericin b products have been introduced  and downward pressure on price resulting from a price reduction by one competitor caused the growth rate of revenues from abelcetr sales to slow significantly in the second half of further price competition is possible if the company s competitors make further attempts to penetrate the market by lowering prices 
although hospitals and other customers have been willing to pay a higher price for abelcetr than conventional amphotericin b due to its superior safety profile  the market is price sensitive  and it cannot be predicted to what extent the demand for amphotericin b will continue to be converted to demand for abelcetr 
it is also possible that new antifungal products may be developed that will compete with abelcetr 
in addition  as with all pharmaceutical products  sales would be adversely affected if adequate supplies of product became unavailable due to recalls  manufacturing problems  shortages of raw materials or other circumstances  although no recalls have ever been required for abelcetr  and the company believes that its high volume facility in indianapolis  indiana will provide adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future 
international sales of abelcetr are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause growth rates to vary 
the company expects international sales generally to increase as the product is introduced into more markets 
however  product launches in italy  france and canada occurred in the latter part of  and sales in these and other countries where the product has been recently approved may grow at differing rates  depending on competitive conditions and on the efforts put forth by the company s marketing partners 
since the product will be sold by marketing partners in a number of large markets  sales levels will fluctuate as these partners adjust inventories and may not coincide with in market sales growth 
sales may grow more slowly in countries where the company has had significant pre approval sales on a named patient basis  since the price to be paid by its marketing partners will be a substantial discount from the in market price 
all of these factors  together with  the effect of currency fluctuations  may distort period to period sales comparisons 
due to the company s reacquisition of rights to evacettm from pfizer  the company anticipates elimination of collaborative research and development revenues in future quarters  as it currently has no other agreements in place 
interest income will be related to the level of cash balances available for investment and the rate of interest earned 
expenses the components of total expenses were cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative  and interest expenses 
total expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over the prior year 
included in these expenses are  of unusual charges incurred by the company following the unfavorable results of the ventustm clinical study  and details of these unusual charges are described below 
total expenses for the year ended december  were  or  higher than see specific expense categories for detail of changes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of goods sold for the year ended december   was  versus  in the period 
the increase from to was a result of the increased unit volume of abelcet sold during and an unusual charge of  for royalties on past sales pursuant to the settlement of patent litigation with the university of texas 
during the year  the company implemented a planned shift in manufacturing sites from princeton to its high volume facility in indianapolis 
as a result of this transition  the company incurred certain costs as it adjusted inventory levels throughout the year 
the indianapolis facility was approved by the fda in august  and the company has reoriented the princeton facility to the production of clinical supplies 
the company expects its unit production costs of abelcet in to improve due to the high volume efficiencies available at the indianapolis facility 
gross margin was in and in  a decline of 
the decline was primarily due to the lower average price of abelcet during as a result of the targeted pricing program  coupled with costs related to the shift of manufacturing from princeton to the company s large capacity production site in indianapolis and the unusual charge for royalties on past sales of abelcet pursuant to the litigation settlement 
cost of goods sold in was  versus  in due to the manufacturing and distribution costs associated with the full year impact of abelcet sales in the us  as well as increased international sales 
gross margins on sales of abelcet improved from in to in reflecting efficiencies realized from the greater production volume of the product 
research and development expenses  which also include clinical and regulatory activities  were  for the year ended december   compared to  for and  for the decrease in spending of  during versus is due to the absence in of pre production costs for the start up of the indianapolis manufacturing facility incurred in partially offsetting this decrease was the unusual charge of  of certain manufacturing overhead costs following the unfavorable results of the ventustm phase iii clinical study  combined with higher expenditures related to the development of tlc ell and evacettm 
the company in the second half of  assumed all the costs related to the clinical studies of evacettm pursuant to its reacquisition of the product from pfizer 
the decrease in spending from to was primarily due to reduced effort required by the company as evacettm progressed to the final stages of development 
during this period  pfizer was conducting and directly funding all clinical studies of evacettm 
partially offsetting the overall reduction were increases in clinical development activities relating to the phase iii study of ventustm  and pre production costs associated with the indianapolis manufacturing facility 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the increase is partially due to the restructuring charges of  following the unfavorable results of the ventustm phase iii study  of which  remains unspent at december  the balance of the increase is due to legal expenses incurred in connection with intellectual property litigation  and higher sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in us sales and marketing expense is due to the sales force expansion that began in late and the growth of related sales and marketing efforts 
international sales and marketing costs also increased as abelcet was launched in france  italy and canada during the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and december  were  and  respectively 
the major component of the increase of  was the full year impact of the us sales and marketing organization established during to launch and market abelcet 
in addition  international sales and marketing costs and legal expenses associated with patent litigation also contributed to the increase 
interest expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
the largest components of costs are associated with the capital leases for the princeton and indianapolis manufacturing equipment and mortgage interest related to the indianapolis building 
in december  the company expanded its equipment lease and received cash funding of  for indianapolis  indiana  manufacturing assets  which caused the increased interest expense in the increase from to was due to costs related to financing agreements completed in late and early preferred stock dividends in and  the company had outstanding an issue of  depositary shares  each of which represented one tenth of a share of series a cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock carrying a dividend rate 
on march   the company called for the redemption of of the preferred stock  with the remainder being called on october  virtually all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted into common stock  thus eliminating the preferred stock dividend requirement in dividends of  were paid on the preferred stock in and the company s dividend payments in were  due to the calls for redemption of the preferred stock 
net loss  net loss applicable to common stock and net loss per share of common stock as a result of the factors discussed above  the company s net loss applicable to common stock was   and  for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the net loss per share basic and diluted for these years was  and  respectively 
weighted average shares used in the per share calculations were   and  respectively 
the increase in average shares outstanding in compared to was due to the full year impact of shares issued pursuant to conversions of preferred stock and shares issued for cash in a private placement 
the increase in average shares outstanding in compared to was due to shares issued pursuant to conversions of preferred stock  the full year impact of shares issued for cash during and the exercise of stock options 
the number of shares of common stock used in each year to calculate basic and diluted loss per share were identical as the company was in a loss position in all periods and the inclusion of contingently issuable shares would have been anti dilutive 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company had  in cash and marketable securities as of december  included in this amount were cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  long term investments in marketable securities of  and restricted cash of  the company invests its cash reserves in a diversified portfolio of high grade corporate marketable and united states government backed securities 
the market value of certain securities in the company s investment portfolio at december  was below their acquisition cost 
the effect of unrealized investment losses at december   pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  at december  was  this unrealized loss was recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
cash and marketable securities both short and long term and restricted cash decreased  from december  to december  the major components of the use of funds were the net loss applicable to common stock net of depreciation of  and capital spending of  partially offsetting the cash outflows was the private placement of  shares of common stock for  and the receipt of  from the exercise of stock options 
inventories at december  increased  from december  during  the company completed its plan to shift manufacturing of abelcet from princeton to a new  cost efficient facility in indianapolis  indiana 
in order to ensure a smooth transition  the company increased its inventory of abelcet during the first half of fda approval of the indianapolis facility was received during the third quarter  and the company has reoriented the princeton facility to the production of clinical supplies 
as planned  the company reduced inventories in the last half of to levels consistent with unit demand for abelcet 
accounts payable at december  was  or  higher than prior year and accrued expenses and other current liabilities were  or  lower than year end 
the variance is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
in july  the company entered into a capitalized lease financing agreement for certain manufacturing equipment providing for an initial lease term followed by options to extend the lease  or to return or purchase the equipment 
in december  the agreement was amended to include an additional  of manufacturing equipment 
in november and january  the company exercised its options to purchase certain manufacturing equipment under the original lease for  and  respectively 
these amounts have been financed as a capital lease obligation under the lease agreement over a three year period 
the lease is collateralized by  in standby letters of credit which are in return collateralized by aaa rated securities owned by the company 
pursuant to the december lease amendment  the company is required to maintain a minimum balance of  in cash and marketable securities  including those securities collateralizing the letters of credit 
in addition  the company completed a us working capital revolving credit line agreement in early  with a maximum capacity of  all borrowings must be secured by approved accounts receivable and finished goods inventories 
the company has a pledge of  which has been classified as restricted cash 
there have been no advances made against this line through the date of this report

to the extent that any funding is actually used by the company  the outstanding principal and interest would be repayable on the earlier of days after fda clearance to market evacettm or in twenty quarterly installments commencing july  pfizer at its option may elect to receive payment in the form of shares of common stock 
the company has a mortgage backed note to partially fund the purchase of the indianapolis manufacturing facility 
the principal balance outstanding at december  is  on april  the company issued  shares of common stock at per share to an investment company wholly owned by a private investor for cash of  at february   this investor has reported total holdings of of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
at december   the company had approximately  of operating loss carryforwards and  of research and development credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes 
these carryforwards expire in the years through the timing and manner in which these losses are used may be limited as a result of certain ownership changes that occurred as provided by irs regulations under section in january  the company completed an offering of  depositary shares  each of which represented one tenth of a share of preferred stock carrying a dividend rate 
on march   the company called for the redemption of of the preferred stock with the remainder being called on october  virtually all of the outstanding preferred stock was converted into common stock 
combined net issuance costs including financial advisory  professional  registration and filing fees of  were incurred in connection with both calls and were charged to equity 
as a result of these conversions  the company s annual preferred stock dividend requirements have been eliminated 
the company expects to finance its operations and capital spending requirements from  among other things  the proceeds received from product sales  interest earned on investments and the proceeds from maturity or sale of certain investments 
cash may also be provided to the company by leasing arrangements for capital expenditures  financing of receivables and inventory under its line of credit  a line of credit from a former licensing and development partner  the licensing of its products and technology and the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company believes that its product revenues and revenues from other sources  coupled with its available cash and marketable securities reserves  will be sufficient to meet its expected operating and capital cash flow requirements for the intermediate term
