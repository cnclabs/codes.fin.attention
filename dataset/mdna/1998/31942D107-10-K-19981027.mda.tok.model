item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s pawnshop revenues are derived primarily from service charges on pawn loans  and the sale of unredeemed goods  or merchandise sales 
pawn loans are made for a day term with an automatic extension of days in texas and missouri  days in oklahoma and days in maryland and virginia 
pawn loans made in washington  dc are made for a day term with no automatic extension 
all pawn loans are collateralized by tangible personal property placed in the custody of the company 
the annualized service charge rates on pawn loans are set by state laws and range between and in texas and and in oklahoma  depending on the size of the loan 
service charge rates are to on an annualized basis in maryland  with a monthly minimum charge 
in washington  dc  loans up to bear a flat charge per month  while loans over bear a to annualized rate 
missouri pawn loans bear service and storage charges totaling per year  and in virginia rates range from to annually 
in its texas stores  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the pawn loan at the lesser of the amount allowed by the state law for the initial day term or  in accordance with state law 
in oklahoma  maryland  virginia  missouri and washington  dc  the company recognizes service charges at the inception of the loan at the amount allowed by law for the first days 
pawn service charge income applicable to the remaining term and or extension period is not recognized until the loan is repaid or renewed 
if a loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the automatic extension period  if applicable  the property is forfeited to the company and held for resale 
as a result of the company s policy of accruing pawn service charges only for the initial day term  unredeemed merchandise is transferred to inventory at a value equal to the loan principal plus one month s accrued interest 
the company s accounting policy defers recognition of an amount of income equal to the amount of pawn service charges relating to the extension period until the loan is repaid or renewed  or until the merchandise is resold 
as a result of this policy  the company s annualized loan yield is lower than certain of its publicly traded competitors 
conversely  this revenue recognition policy results in inventory being recorded at a lower value  which results in realization of a larger gross profit margin on merchandise sales than would be realized by certain of the company s publicly traded competitors 
this policy  in the company s opinion  lessens the risk that the inventory s cost will exceed its realizable value when sold 
however  if the pawn loan is repaid or renewed  or if the forfeited merchandise is resold  the amount of income which would be recognized by the company or certain of its publicly traded competitors would be the same over time 
revenues at the company s check cashing stores are derived primarily from check cashing fees  fees on payday advances  and fees from the sale of money orders and wire transfers 
payday advances have a term of thirty days or less  and carry a service charge in both california and washington 
the company recognizes service charge income on payday advances at the inception of the advance 
bad debts on payday advances are charged to operating expense in the month that the items are returned by the bank  and are credited to operating expense in the period the items are subsequently collected 
although the company has had significant increases in revenues due primarily to acquisitions and secondarily to new store openings  the company has also incurred increases in operating expenses attributable to the additional stores and increases in administrative expenses attributable to building a management team and the support personnel required by the company s growth 
operating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the company s stores  including salaries and related payroll costs  rent  utilities  equipment depreciation  advertising  property taxes  licenses  supplies  security and net returned checks 
administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate office  including the salaries of corporate officers  area supervisors and other management  accounting and administrative costs  liability and casualty insurance  outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder related expenses

liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and acquisitions during the past three years have been financed with funds generated from operations  bank and other borrowings  and the issuance of the company s securities 
effective november   the company increased its long term line of credit with its senior commercial lender to  the credit facility 
at july    was outstanding under this credit facility and an additional  was available to the company pursuant to the available borrowing base 
the credit facility bears interest at the prevailing libor rate plus one percent  and matures on november  amounts available under the credit facility are limited to of the company s earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve months 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants 
the company was in compliance with these requirements and covenants during fiscal and as of october  the company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused portion of the credit facility commitment

in april  the company acquired of the outstanding common stock of jb pawn  inc  which operates ten pawn stores in texas and maryland  for a total cash price of  in june  the company acquired of the outstanding common stock of miraglia  inc for a total purchase price of  consisting of  shares of first cash common stock valued at  or per share  a  note payable to the sellers   cash  and legal  consulting and other costs totaling  miraglia  inc operates eleven check cashing stores located in california and washington  as well as answers  etc  a provider of computer hardware and software to third party operators of check cashing stores 
in addition to jb pawn  inc and miraglia  inc  the company acquired a total of additional individual pawnshops in various regions at various times during the fiscal year for an aggregate purchase price of  including legal  consulting  assumed liabilities and other costs incidental to the acquisitions 
the company financed substantially all of the cash purchase price for all of its fiscal acquisitions through its credit facility 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was determined based upon the volume of annual loan and sales transactions  outstanding loan balances  inventory on hand  location and condition of the facilities  and projected future operating results 
as of july   the company s primary sources of liquidity were  in cash and cash equivalents   in service charges receivable   in receivables   in inventories and  of available and unused funds under the company s credit facility 
the company had working capital as of july  of  and a liabilities to equity ratio of to net cash provided by operating activities of the company during fiscal was  consisting primarily of net income before non cash depreciation and amortization of  less cash used to fund the increase of balance sheet items of  net cash used for investing activities during fiscal was  which was comprised of cash used for increasing receivables at existing stores of  and cash paid for acquisitions and other fixed asset additions of  during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was  during fiscal  which consisted of net increases in the company s debt of  supplemented by cash provided from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of pawn loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s loan decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of forfeiture of collateral by increasing or decreasing the amount loaned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate loan balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small loans in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tends to increase loan redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger loans in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also larger average loan balances can result in an increase in loan forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
in each of the company s last three fiscal years  at least of amounts loaned under pawn transactions were either paid in full or renewed  and it is management s current intent to maintain this ratio 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawn loans by repaying all accrued interest on such pawn loans  effectively creating a new loan transaction 
in addition to these factors  the company s liquidity is affected by merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions 
management believes that the credit facility  current assets and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments as of october  the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and will likely seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion through existing store acquisitions and new store openings 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with  potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
the company has no immediate plans to open any other new stores 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire or open a new store in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
between august  and october   the company acquired three individual check cashing stores for an aggregate purchase price of  and opened one new check cashing location 
in addition  the company acquired five pawnshops for an aggregate purchase price of  and opened one new pawnshop location

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs that use two digits instead of four to record the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year instead of the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other events  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the year is a leap year  which may also lead to incorrect calculations  functions or system failure 
the company has established a committee to initiate the process of gathering  testing  and producing information about the company s operations systems impacted by the year transition 
the company intends to utilize both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test systems for year compliance 
the company intends to contact its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies with which the company s systems interface will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems would not require the company to spend more time or money than anticipated  or even have a material adverse effect on the company 
although the year assessment has not been completed  management currently believes  based on available information  that resolving these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or it s results of operations
