year compliance the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s operating system and database system are year compliant

effect of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued two new reporting and disclosure standards 
results of operations and financial position will be unaffected by implementation of these new standards 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  established standards of reporting and display of comprehensive income  its components and accumulated balances 
comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
among other disclosures  sfas requires all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas  disclosure about segments of a business enterprise  establishes standards of the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements issued to the public 
it also establishes standards of disclosures regarding products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
both of these new standards are effective for financial statements of periods beginning after december  and require comparative information for earlier years to be restated 
adoption of sfas and are not expected to have any material effect on the company s financial statement disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
due to the recent issuance of this standard  management has been unable to fully evaluate the extent of future financial statement disclosures that may be required 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last two fiscal years
