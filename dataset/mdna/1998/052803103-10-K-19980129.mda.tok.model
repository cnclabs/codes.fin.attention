the company has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the total year project cost is estimated at approximately  which includes  for the purchase of new software that will be capitalized and  that will be expensed as incurred 
to date  the company has incurred  primarily for assessment of the year issue and the development of a modification plan

the project is expected to be completed not later than august  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and the completed conversion to a new business system  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the availability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the company is in the process of reviewing its product line to assist its customers with the year issue 
the company believes that its products offered for sale since june  are year compliant and no additional costs or expenses are anticipated under warranties or to service such products except for the development of certain testing hardware and computer software which it presently estimates will cost approximately  to develop 
the company believes that a majority of its products sold before june  are also year compliant 
however  certain of its older products  the sale of which were discontinued several years ago  may not be year compliant 
the company believes such products are no longer under warranty and the company does not intend to renew its one year service contract as they relate to these older products or products of others that it services which are not year compliant 
in most cases  the company offers a new  year compliant product which can be purchased as a replacement for the older product that is not year compliant  along with annual maintenance agreements
