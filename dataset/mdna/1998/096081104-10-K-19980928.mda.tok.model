item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net sales 
net sales decreased from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal  to  in fiscal sales of lsi s products were  or of consolidated revenues    and  during each of fiscal   and  respectively 
lsi s traditional customer base is heavily weighted toward commercial oem s 
product development and life cycles for commercial oem s are typically short as compared to mil aero programs 
commercial oem s and defense contractors are now developing products that utilize next generation dsp s from suppliers such as ti c family and analog devices which  in turn  creates tremendous opportunities for the company in a number of emerging application areas such as wireless communications and internet telephony 
however  many of these opportunities are at the expense of existing technologies that are available in plentiful supply 
this technology transition has had a significant impact on the company s operations during fiscal and ultimately contributed to the decline in revenues during fiscal and is expected to continue to impact revenues during the first half of the company s fiscal when ti introduced their cx family of dsp s in lsi experienced a revenue trend similar to that experienced in  followed by a significant increase in revenues when the cx family was in plentiful supply 
the majority of mizar s dsp based revenues were to prime contractors to the federal government and were used in defense  aviation and intelligence applications 
the company believes that the trend of the federal government to emphasize the purchase of commercial off the shelf cots products versus proprietary designs dedicated to a specific application will continue to have a positive impact in the future 
major program selling in this industry inherently raises the risk of revenue fluctuations such as that experienced in fiscal when mizar s dsp based revenues declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  then increased to  in fiscal the decline in mizar s dsp revenues in occurred despite bookings associated with dsp based products increasing from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in and throughout  the company has experienced a significant increase in bookings for ruggedized dsp based products 
the time lag between order booking and revenue recognition associated with ruggedized products can be much longer due to design adaptation  component ordering and manufacturing lead times 
although short term variability is increased  the company views this as a very positive long term trend since more programs are progressing to a production stage versus a prototype or testing phase 
revenues from the company s non dsp products have declined steadily from  to 
this non strategic product line is expected to decline further in fiscal the company believes that as a result of the merger its dependence on a particular industry group  geographic area  or technology will be reduced 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the decline in gross margin percentage in is attributable to the company s fixed manufacturing expenses being spread over declining shipments  and inventory provisions related to product scrap and obsolescence 
much of the provision for product obsolescence is related to the technology transition discussed above that has impacted current revenues 
the company s gross margin percentage has varied each year  and each quarter  in both a positive and negative fashion due to factors mentioned above  and changes in customer and specific product mix 
such variations will continue to impact gross margin percentages in future reporting periods 
product development and engineering 
engineering expenses increased from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal  and to  in fiscal these expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has steadily increased its investment in new product development throughout these periods  especially in emerging application areas  and expanding the capabilities of its products to function in non benign environments such as extended shock  vibration  humidity or temperature ranges 
the company s telecommunications product development efforts now comprise almost one half of the company s new product development efforts 
the company believes this will greatly expand its available served market during and beyond

sales and marketing expenses increased from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal  to  in fiscal these expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were   and in fiscal  and  respectively

sales and marketing expenses are expected to remain relatively flat during fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal these expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was  in part  due to a number of non recurring expenses including settlement expenses aggregating  associated with a dispute with lsi s former german distributor  and the recognition of  expense associated with the employment agreement of david irwin  former president and ceo of mizar  who resigned in june  and executive search fees for his successor 
other increases include facility expansion expenses in europe  and increased expenses associated with it 
general and administrative expenses are expected to decline during fiscal as a result of merger related synergies

the company incurred significant costs and expenses to consummate the complex  cross border transaction with lsi 
also  in conjunction with the merger  the company realigned its business operations in order to better meet the needs of its customers  capitalize on the synergy between blue wave and lsi and to strategically focus the company on the growing telecommunications market 
the company recorded an  nonrecurring charge for merger and strategic realignment related costs and expenses

interest expense 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal  to  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is due to debt reductions made possible by utilizing the pounds  proceeds from the issuance of the lsi preference shares in april interest expense will increase in fiscal as the company continues to utilize bank credit facilities 
provision for income taxes

the company recorded a valuation allowance on of the tax losses in due to the recent unfavorable operating results 
as a result of the significant net losses incurred in previous years  the company has accumulated a net operating loss nol carryforward  a portion of which was used to reduce the company s us federal income tax liability in fiscal years through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  a change in ownership of the company greater than  as defined  within a three year period occurred twice  once due to the company s ipo in and once due to the merger with lsi in the company s us annual utilization limitation related to its nol carryforward is now approximately  the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset of  recorded in the balance sheet as of june  and accordingly no valuation allowance has been provided on this portion of the asset 
this conclusion is based on changes in operations that have recently occurred  including the acquisition of lsi  which management believes will expand its product capabilities and customer base  cost reduction or synergies to be gained from the combination of mizar and lsi  the realignment of the company including its strategy to expand its markets in the telecommunications industry  the introduction of systems based upon the cx technology  limitation of the net operating loss carryforwards  as described above  related to the lsi merger  and projections of sufficient taxable us income to fully realize the net recognized deferred tax asset by the end of calendar year management continually evaluates the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on such assets

year initiatives the company has implemented a plan yk plan to attempt to assess and mitigate the potential impact of the year problem throughout the company 
this problem can arise when time sensitive embedded software utilizes a two digit year date field  sorting years beginning in before the year 
improper sorting can result in data corruption and processing errors 
this problem can be present in licensed software  software developed for internal use  software developed for customer use  and technology equipment 
additionally  year problems resident with key business partners to the company must also be identified and addressed 
the company has completed a detailed assessment of its internal systems and will have to replace portions of software used internally so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates beginning in  and thereafter 
year compliance questionnaires are being sent to key suppliers and a monitoring process has been established to ensure the suppliers respond and comply with the requirements 
key customers will be questioned about their year plans to ensure that our products remain compatible with the customer s requirements 
compliance testing of all areas covered by the company s yk plan are scheduled for completion by  and any required corrective action plans are scheduled to be established by  december  any required corrective actions are scheduled for completion by june   and will be tested to insure they are year compliant 
the total year project cost is not expected to be material in relation to the company s financial position or results of operations 
although the company believes that its yk plan will adequately address the potential impact caused by the year problem  there can be no assurance that the company s yk plan will be sufficiently comprehensive or that it will be completed on a timely basis 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be yk compliant  or that a failure to convert by a supplier or customer  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse affect on the company 
if a key supplier of the company fails to be yk compliant  the company could suffer a material loss of business or incur significant additional expenses 
the company has developed the framework for contingency plans in the event it or third parties are unable to complete system modifications to address the year issue
