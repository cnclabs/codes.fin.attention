item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  capital resources and liquidity 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto 
results of continuing operations the company s principal business segment is oil and gas production 
crude oil marketing and transportation was also a principal segment until its sale on december  results of continuing operations by segment for the three years ended december   are discussed below 
the table below for each segment s revenues does not reflect the elimination of intercompany revenues 
see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas production year ended december  revenues in thousands sales of oil and natural gas    sales of labarge other products    gas marketing    minerals leasing and other total revenues    operating profit in thousands    operating information average net daily production oil and ngl bbls    natural gas mcf    average sales prices oil and ngl per bbl natural gas per mcf revenues revenues for increased primarily due to an increase in the natural gas price of to per thousand cubic feet 
minerals leasing activity has been steadily increasing over the last three years 
these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in gas marketing revenue due to reduced activity 
oil and natural gas revenues increased in primarily due to improved product prices  partially offset by reduced product volumes 
gas marketing revenue increased due to increased prices 
revenues from the sales of the la barge other products are attributable to sales of carbon dioxide  helium and sulfur 
increased production levels of helium and carbon dioxide in relative to and were partially offset by reduced product sales prices 
sulfur sales revenues have been insignificant 
operating profit in  the operating profit of this segment decreased million when compared to the decrease was primarily due to increased workover expenses and labarge expenses 
workover costs increased from million in to million in primarily due to platform refurbishment on main pass the operating profit of this segment increased million when comparing to the higher oil and gas sales prices were the largest factors in this increase in operating profit 
the increase in gas marketing revenues was offset by an increase in gas marketing costs 
partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in production cost due primarily to workover expense on an offshore gas supply well 
also reducing operating profit was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization per equivalent barrel of production from in to in an increase in general and administrative costs from million in to million in also partially offset the improvements 
howell s average realized oil price for the fourth quarter was per barrel 
the crude oil price decline that began in the latter part of the fourth quarter has continued into early management anticipates that lower oil and gas prices may continue for the near term 
during such period  the company s cash flow and funds available for reinvestment are reduced 
accordingly  howell is currently focusing its capital investments on obligatory projects and pilot programs designed to build an inventory of projects for long term shareholder value 
in the interim  should lower product prices be sustained  howell will record a significant non cash ceiling test writedown at the end of the first quarter to the value of its proved oil and gas properties 
crude oil marketing transportation year ended december  in thousands revenues 
  operating profit   there were no revenues or operating profits during in the crude oil marketing and transportation segment as a result of the december   purchase sale and contribution conveyance of howell crude oil s and howell transportation s assets and liabilities associated with crude oil gathering 
however  the company did retain direct and indirect interest in genesis 
as a result of the company s interest  the company recognized net earnings in genesis of million during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues increased in from million in to million in  and operating profit increased in from million in to million in the increase can be attributed to the company s pipeline activities 
also contributing to the increase in operating profit was a decrease in general and administrative costs of million from to the crude oil marketing activities accounted for an increase in operating profit of million offset by a decrease in operating profit for transportation activities of million 
effective december   the company s sale of the assets and liabilities associated with crude oil gathering resulted in a pre tax gain of million recognized in other income expense 
interest expense interest expense in decreased million below the level 
the primary reason for this decrease was repayment of the term loan and revolving credit facilities out of funds received from i the december   sale of the assets and liabilities associated with crude oil gathering to genesis  ii the december  sale of of the outstanding common stock of howell transportation services  inc to lodestar logistics  inc  and iii the july   sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s research and reference fuels and custom chemical manufacturing business to specified 
short term and long term debt debt averaged million for the first half of the proceeds of the sale to specified were used to reduce debt to an average of million for the last half of the year before the acquisition and an average of million for the last half of the year including the acquisition 
the average debt during was million 
the purchase of the wyoming properties from amoco on december   increased debt to million at year end 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in rose million over the level 
the primary reason for this increase was attributable to the funds borrowed by the company in march to finance the acquisitions of three crude oil pipelines from exxon and certain oil and gas properties from norcen 
debt decreased from million at december   to million at december   due primarily to the repayment of the term loan and pay down of the revolving credit facility with proceeds received from the conveyance of the company s crude operations to genesis 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the increase in interest expense from higher average outstanding balances in was slightly offset by decreasing market interest rates 
market interest rates ranged from to throughout  while in the rates fluctuated from to 
because substantially all of the company s debt is subject to market rates  the lower rates contributed to an offset of the increase in interest expense 
provision for income taxes in  the company s effective tax rate of reflects the statutory federal rate and state income taxes less the effect of statutory depletion deductions in excess of cost basis 
higher pretax income in  reducing the effect of these statutory depletion deductions and a higher state tax provision in and  increased the effective tax rate in those years to and  respectively 
results from discontinued operations technical fuels and chemical processing on july   seller completed the previously announced sale and disposition of substantially all of the assets of its research and reference fuels and custom chemical manufacturing business to specified 
the results of the technical fuels and chemical processing business have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations also includes the allocation of interest expense based on a ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to total consolidated net assets 
allocated amounts are as follows year ended december  in thousands liquidity and capital resources on december   the company replaced its existing revolving credit term loan agreement with a new credit facility 
the credit facility comprises two tranches 
tranche a is a five year revolving credit facility with a maximum credit amount  subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations based on the company s oil and natural gas properties  of million 
the company is required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of tranche a at a rate of 
per annum  if or less of the borrowing base is unused  or 
if more than of the borrowing base is unused 
available credit under tranche a may also be used for letters of credit on the company s behalf 
tranche b is a one year term loan facility providing for one million advance to finance the acquisition 
outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus 
or the bank s prime rate  plus  in either case  the applicable margin the applicable margin provided for in the credit facility  or ii libor plus the applicable margin 
the credit facility is unsecured 
the credit facility contains certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on the ability of the company to incur additional debt  sell assets  merge or consolidate with other persons or pay dividends on its capital in excess of historical levels and a prohibition on change of control or management  as well as a covenant to raise at least million in equity or subordinated debt by december  in addition  the credit facility requires the company to maintain a ratio of current assets plus tranche a borrowing capacity to current liabilities  excluding current maturities of long term debt  of at least to and an interest coverage ratio of not less than to until the end of and to thereafter 
the credit facility also provides the company with additional borrowing capacity solely for the purpose of financing the acquisition of the beaver creek unit if such acquisition is consummated on or before december  the additional capacity comprises million under tranche a of the credit facility and million under tranche b subject to certain reductions based upon previously raised subordinated capital 
funding of the additional borrowing capacity is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions  including that no material adverse effect as defined in the credit facility shall have occurred 
the credit facility also contains certain additional provisions that will apply only if the acquisition of the beaver creek unit occurs 
these provisions include a change in the covenant to raise capital described above so that the company must raise in total at least million in equity and or subordinated debt  including at least million of equity  by december  in addition  if within six months after the consummation of the acquisition of the beaver creek unit this minimum capital is not raised  tranche b has not been repaid or the company is in default as defined in the credit facility the credit facility will become secured by a portion of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
on december   the company drew approximately million under tranche a of the credit facility and million under tranche b to pay the purchase price in the acquisition including fees and refinance approximately million in previously existing bank debt of which million represents the deposit held by amoco for the purchase of the beaver creek unit 
as of december   the outstanding amounts under tranche a bore interest at per annum on million  on million and on million  and the outstanding amount under tranche b bore interest at per annum 
in  the company issued  shares of convertible preferred stock 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
dividends on the convertible preferred stock are to be paid quarterly 
such dividends accrue and are cumulative 
the company has paid all dividends on time 
at december   the company had negative working capital of million  including the million tranche b  one year loan facility referred to above 
in  cash provided from operating activities was million 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately 
million during fiscal years and at various of its facilities for capital and operating costs associated with ongoing environmental compliance and may continue to have expenditures in connection with environmental matters beyond fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its current liquidity requirements 
at december   the company had million available to it under the credit facility 
the decline in the value of the company s proved reserves experienced since december   if sustained  could result in the bank reducing the borrowing base  thereby causing mandatory payments under the credit facility 
while the company does not expect this to happen in  such payments would adversely affect the company s ability to carry out its capital expenditure program and could cause the company to accelerate its plans to recapitalize its debt through the public or private placement of securities 
in order to guarantee the company a specific minimum sales price for its crude oil  the company purchased a put option and sold a call option covering approximately  barrels per day of crude oil production for an month period beginning march  the option strike prices were based on the average price of crude oil on the organized exchange with monthly settlement 
the strike prices were per barrel for the put option and per barrel for the call option 
during  the monthly average sales price of crude oil on the organized exchange was between and per barrel  therefore  no options were exercised during the period 
during  the monthly average sales price of crude oil on the organized exchange was between and per barrel for january and february  therefore  no options were exercised during the two months 
the monthly average sales price for the remainder of the march  call option period  march through august  was above the ceiling 
this resulted in collar payments of million  excluding the premium amortization and were recorded as a reduction of revenue 
upon the expiration of the month option period  the company purchased a per barrel put option and sold a per barrel call option covering  barrels of oil per month for a six month period ending february  for september through december  the monthly average sales price exceeded the ceiling price 
this resulted in collar payments for the four month period of million and were recorded as a reduction of revenue 
in  the monthly average price of crude oil on the organized exchange exceeded the strike price for the call option during january and february  the final two months of the options 
the payments required in under the call option totaled million and were recorded as a reduction of revenue 
subsequent to february  the company has not engaged in hedging activities for its oil and gas production  but will consider doing so in the future 
beaver creek acquisition the company s previously announced approximately million acquisition of the beaver creek unit the beaver creek acquisition from amoco was not closed due to litigation initiated by snyder oil corporation over an alleged preferential right to purchase such property 
as described above  the company has arranged financing for the beaver creek acquisition  provided such acquisition is consummated on or before december  funding of the additional borrowing capacity is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions  including that no material adverse effect as defined in the credit facility shall have occurred 
there can be no assurance that the litigation can be resolved by such date 
further  if oil and gas prices were to remain at currently depressed levels  financing may be difficult to obtain 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income  sfas and statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas 
sfas and are effective for periods beginning after december  sfas establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components 
sfas establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in interim and annual financial statements 
these two statements will have no effect on the company s financial statements  but management is continuing to evaluate what  if any  additional disclosures may be required when these two statements are adopted in year date conversion the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary internal and external resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner
