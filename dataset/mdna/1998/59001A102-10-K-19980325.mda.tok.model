residual interest and real estate loan interest income was higher in the twelve months ended december  than in the previous year mainly due to the sale of two of the company s mortgage securities  which resulted in gains of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the increase was caused by homebuilding administrative costs  including amortization of goodwill  expenses related to the legacy combination and other home selling expenses  such as commissions  which the company did not incur in the increase in income taxes to  for the twelve months ended december  from  in the prior year resulted from a significant increase in pre tax earnings in the favorable effective tax rates of and in and  respectively  result from the company s net operating loss carryforward

per share in results for the year ended december  include an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt of  or 
per share 
the company s income from mortgage assets was  in compared to income of  in the company s interest expense declined from  in to  in due to a reduction of the average aggregate long term debt 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal uses of working capital are land purchases  lot development and home construction 
the company uses a combination of borrowings and funds generated by operations to meet is working capital requirements 
the cash flow for each of the company s communities can differ substantially from reported earnings  depending on the status of the development cycle 
the early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for  among other things  land acquisitions  obtaining plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
after the early stages of development and expansion when these expenditures are made  cash flow can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
at december   the company had available short term secured revolving construction loan facilities totaling million and a million acquisition development facility  of which approximately and million were outstanding  respectively 
an additional million of unborrowed funds supported by approved collateral were available under its credit facilities at such date 
borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to the inventory collateral position of the company and a number of other conditions  including minimum net worth  debt to equity and debt coverage tests 
the company also has outstanding million in unsecured  senior subordinated notes due october  the notes  which were issued in october a provision of the senior subordinated bond indenture provides bondholders with the option  at june   to require the company to buy back the bonds at of face value 
management believes that the company s current borrowing capacity  cash on hand at december  and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that amounts available in the future from the company s sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet the company s future capital needs and the amount and types of indebtedness that the company may incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing its senior subordinated notes and the credit agreements 
comparison to prior year pro forma results of operations as a result of the merger  the primary business of the company has shifted to homebuilding from the making of real estate loans and holding residual interests 
due to this change  management believes that comparison of operations in the current year with the prior year operations is not as meaningful as a comparison to the prior year s pro forma results 
accordingly  management has prepared pro forma condensed combined operating results for the year ended december   which reflect the impact of combining the pre merger companies as though the merger had taken place on january  the following current year information only reflects the addition of legacy subsequent to july  results of operations for the year ended december  pro forma dollars in thousands  except per share data home and land sales revenue   cost of home and land sales   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   other income  net   earnings before income taxes   income tax expense net earnings   diluted earnings per share key assumptions in the pro forma results of operations relate to the following the homeplex merger was consummated on january  compensation expense was adjusted to add the new employees cost and to deduct the terminated employees cost 
the net operating loss was utilized to reduce the maximum amount of taxable income possible 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information regarding the results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries for the year ended december  and pro forma operations for the year ended december  all material balances and transactions between the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated 
results include the operations of legacy from july   the combination date  to december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  in the opinion of management  the data reflects all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary to fairly present the company s financial position and results of operations for the periods presented 
home sales revenue home sales revenue is the product of the number of units closed during the period and the average sales price per unit 
the following table presents comparative and housing revenues dollars in thousands year ended dollar unit percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease dollars    units closed average sales price the increase in revenues and number of units closed in compared to resulted mainly from the addition of the texas operations 
the lower average sales price in is also due to sales in the texas market  where the company s focus is on entry level and move up homes 
gross profit gross profit equals home and land sales revenue  net of housing cost of sales  which include developed lot costs  unit construction costs  amortization of common community costs such as the cost of model complex and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
the following table presents comparative and housing gross profit dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar unit percentage increase increase dollars    percent of housing revenues the dollar increase in gross profit for the twelve months ended december   is attributable to the increase in number of units closed due to the legacy combination  along with increased closings in highly profitable arizona communities 
the gross profit margin increased in due to generally higher margins in texas  and an increase in the purchase by customers of more profitable custom options and upgrades with respect to arizona closings 
residual interest and real estate interest income the increase in residual interest and real estate loan interest income is primarily due to the sale of two of the company s mortgage securities  which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  which include advertising  model and sales office  sales administration  commissions and corporate overhead costs  were approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in  an increase of 
these changes were caused mainly by higher administrative  corporate and public company costs and the inclusion of legacy operating costs in the second half of net orders net orders for any period represent the number of units ordered by customers net of units canceled multiplied by the average sales price per units ordered 
the following table presents comparative and net orders dollars in thousands year ended dollar unit percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease dollars    units ordered average sales price the company does not include sales which are contingent on the sale of the customer s existing home as orders until the contingency is removed 
historically  the company has experienced a cancellation rate of less than of gross sales 
total net orders increased in compared to due to the expansion into texas and the economic strength of both the arizona and texas markets 
net sales backlog backlog represents net orders which have not closed 
the following table presents comparative and net sales backlog for the total company  and the arizona and texas divisions individually 
dollars in thousands december  dollar unit percentage total increase decrease increase decrease dollars    units in backlog average sales price arizona dollars    units in backlog average sales price 
texas dollars    units in backlog average sales price 
prior year s texas information is included for comparative purposes only 
total dollar backlog increased over the prior year due to a substantial increase in units in backlog partially offset by a decrease in average sales price 
average sales price as a whole has decreased due to the legacy combination  where the focus is on entry level and move up homes 
units in backlog have increased over the prior year due to the increase in net orders caused by the texas expansion 
arizona dollar backlog increased over the prior year due to the increased number of units in backlog offset by a decrease in average sales price due to a change in the product mix of units ordered 
texas dollar and unit backlog is up over the prior year due to increased orders in the average sales price is slightly lower due to the increase in the product mix of entry level home sales 
seasonality the company has historically closed more units in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half  due in part to the slightly seasonal nature of the market for their semi custom  luxury product homes 
management expects that this seasonal trend will continue in the future  but may change slightly as operations continue to expand within the move up and starter home segments of the market 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition of the company the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to successfully design  develop  construct and sell homes that satisfy dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the price of the company s common stock and warrants could be affected not only by such operating and financial conditions  but also by many other factors 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition could include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
homebuilding industry factors 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic and other conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
although the company believes that certain of its customers particularly purchasers of luxury homes are somewhat less price sensitive than generally is the case for other homebuilders  such uncertainties could adversely affect the company s performance 
in addition  homebuilders are subject to various risks  many of which are outside the control of the homebuilders  including delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in government regulations  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  and availability and cost of land  materials  and labor 
although the principal raw materials used in the homebuilding industry generally are available from a variety of sources  such materials are subject to periodic price fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of any of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
customer demand for new housing also impacts the homebuilding industry 
real estate analysts predict that in new home sales in the phoenix metropolitan area may slow and that sales in the tucson metropolitan area may remain relatively flat 
any such slowing in new home sales would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
in general  home sales in the texas market are expected to show moderate growth or remain relatively flat 
the homebuilding industry is subject to the potential for significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values  as evidenced by the changes in real estate values in recent years in arizona and texas 
although the company believes that its projects are currently reflected on its balance sheet at appropriate values  no assurance can be given that write downs of some or all of the company s projects will not occur if market conditions deteriorate  or that such write downs will not be material in amount 
fluctuations in operating results 
monterey historically has experienced  and in the future  the company expects to continue to experience  variability in home sales and net earnings on a quarterly basis 
factors expected to contribute to this variability include  among others  i the timing of home closings and land sales  ii the company s ability to continue to acquire additional land or options to acquire additional land on acceptable terms  iii the condition of the real estate market and the general economy in arizona and texas  and in other areas into which the company may expand its operations  iv the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  v costs or shortages of materials and labor  and vi delays in construction schedules due to strikes  adverse weather conditions  acts of god  the availability of subcontractors or governmental restrictions 
as a result of such variability  the company s historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results 
interest rates and mortgage financing 
the company believes that certain of its move up and luxury home customers have been somewhat less sensitive to interest rate fluctuation than many homebuyers 
however  many purchasers of the company s homes finance their acquisition through third party lenders providing mortgage financing 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs  and the unavailability of mortgage financing 
if mortgage interest rates increase and the ability of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is consequently adversely affected  the company s home sales  gross margins and net income may be adversely impacted and such adverse impact may be material 
in any event  the company s homebuilding activities are dependent upon the availability and costs of mortgage financing for buyers of homes owned by potential customers so those customers move up buyers can sell their homes and purchase a home from the company 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of such financing could adversely affect the company s home sales 
furthermore  changes in federal income tax laws may affect demand for new homes 
from time to time  proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to eliminate or limit tax free rollover treatment provided under current law where the proceeds of the sale of a principal residence are reinvested in a new principal residence 
enactment of such proposals may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general  and on demand for the company s products in particular 
no prediction can be made whether any such proposals will be enacted and  if enacted  the particular form such laws would take 
competition 
the single family residential housing industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
homebuilders compete for desirable properties  financing  raw materials  and skilled labor 
the company competes for residential home sales with other developers and individual resales of existing homes 
competitors include large homebuilding companies  some of which have greater financial resources than the company  and smaller homebuilders  who may have lower costs than the company 
competition is expected to continue and become more intense  and there may be new entrants in the markets in which the company currently operates and in markets it may enter in the future 
lack of geographic diversification 
the company s operations are presently localized in the phoenix and tucson  arizona and dallas ft 
worth  austin and houston  texas metropolitan areas 
in addition  the company currently operates in two primary market segments in arizona the semi custom  luxury market and move up buyer market  and in two primary market segments in texas the move up buyer market and the entry level home market 
failure to be more geographically or economically diversified by product line could have a material adverse impact on the company if the homebuilding market in arizona or texas should decline  because there may not be a balancing opportunity in a healthier market in other geographic regions 
additional financing  limitations 
the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  the company incurs substantial indebtedness to finance its homebuilding activities 
at december   the company s debt totaled approximately million 
the company may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including bank financing and securities offerings 
in addition  lenders are increasingly requiring developers to invest significant amounts of equity in a project both in connection with origination of new loans as well as the extension of existing loans 
if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund its planned capital or other expenditures  new projects planned or begun may be delayed or abandoned 
any such delay or abandonment could result in a reduction in home sales and may adversely affect the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future or on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  the amount and types of indebtedness that the company can incur is limited by the terms and conditions of its current indebtedness 
the company must comply with numerous operating and financial maintenance covenants and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with such financial and other covenants 
failure to comply with such covenants would result in a default and resulting cross defaults under the company s other indebtedness  and could result in acceleration of all such indebtedness 
any such acceleration would have a material adverse affect on the company 
government regulations  environmental conditions 
the company is subject to local  state  and federal statutes and rules regulating certain developmental matters  as well as building and site design 
in addition  the company is subject to various fees and charges of governmental authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
the company may be subject to additional costs and delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no growth or slow growth initiatives  building permit ordinances  building moratoriums  or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to health  safety  welfare  or environmental concerns 
the company must also obtain licenses  permits  and approvals from government agencies to engage in certain of its activities  the granting or receipt of which are beyond the company s control 
the company and its competitors are also subject to a variety of local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays  may cause substantial compliance and other costs  and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas 
environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber 
recent expansion and future expansion 
the company recently concluded a significant expansion into the texas market and the company may continue to consider growth in other areas of the country 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  the company s financial capabilities  and general economic and business conditions 
acquisitions by the company may result in the incurrence of additional debt and or amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets that could adversely affect the company s profitability 
acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of the company s equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has had no or only limited direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to expand into new markets on a profitable basis or that it can successfully manage its expansion into texas or any additional markets 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success is largely dependent on the continuing services of certain key persons  including william w 
cleverly  steven j 
hilton and john r 
landon  and the ability of the company to attract new personnel required to continue the development of the company 
the company has entered into employment agreements with each of messrs 
cleverly  hilton and landon 
a loss by the company of the services of messrs 
cleverly  hilton or landon  or certain other key personnel  could have a material adverse affect on the company 
dependence on subcontractors 
the company conducts its business only as a general contractor in connection with the design  development and construction of its communities 
virtually all architectural and construction work is performed by subcontractors of the company 
as a consequence  the company is dependent upon the continued availability and satisfactory performance by unaffiliated third party subcontractors in designing and building its homes 
there is no assurance that there will be sufficient availability and satisfactory performance by unaffiliated third party subcontractors in designing and building its homes  and such a lack could have a material adverse affect on the company 
nol carryforward 
the ability of the company to use the nol carryforward to offset future taxable income would be substantially limited under section of the code if an ownership change  within the meaning of section of the code  has occurred or occurs with respect to the company before expiration of the nol carryforward 
the company belives that i there was not an ownership change of the company prior to the effective date of the merger  ii the merger did not cause an ownership change  and iii the legacy combination did not cause an ownership change 
pursuant to section of the code  the company may not be permitted to use the nol carryforward to offset taxable income resulting from sales of assets owned by the monterey entities at the time of the merger or to offset taxable income resulting from sales of certain assets acquired in the legacy combination to the extent that the fair market value of such assets at the time of the merger or at the time of the lagacy combination exceeded their tax basis as of the relevant date 
there is no assurance that the company will have sufficiant earnings in the future to fully utilize the nol carryforward
