the maximum amount to be funded will be determined by a formula based on future development 
in august  the company refinanced the  construction loan on its jackson  michigan shopping center with a permanent loan of  the permanent loan has a term of years and bears interest at 
the loan required the establishment of a  letter of credit at closing which is to be used to pay down the loan in august if certain leasing requirements are not attained

the maximum amount of the loan is  and the loan is due in october the company has the option of paying interest at the prime rate or based on the eurodollar rate plus  which may be locked in for one  two  three  or six month periods at the company s discretion

at april   the company had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling  of which  was available and  was reserved for the letter of credit issued for the jackson  michigan loan discussed above

effects of inflation on revenues and operating profits the effects of inflation upon the company s operating results are varied 
inflation in the current year has been modest and has had minimal effect on the company 
the construction segment subcontracts most of its work at fixed prices  which normally will help that segment protect its profit margin percentage 
in the manufacturing segment  the raw material prices were stable 
in the real estate segment  many of the leases are long term over years with fixed rents except for contingent rent provisions by which the company may earn additional rent as a result of increases in tenants sales 
the contingent rent provisions  however  permit the tenants in most cases  to offset against contingent rents any increases in ad valorem taxes over a specified amount 
if inflation were to rise  ad valorem taxes would probably increase which  in turn  would cause a decrease in the contingent rents 
furthermore  the company has certain repair obligations and the costs of repairs increase with inflation 
inflation causes a rise in interest rates  which has a positive effect on investment income  but has a negative effect on profit margins because of the increased costs of production 
overall  inflation will tend to limit the company s markets and  in turn  will reduce revenues as well as operating profits 
year management has undertaken a program to prepare the company s financial and operating computer systems and ancillary applications for the year all necessary software modifications are expected to occur in a timely manner at a cost which is not expected to be material
