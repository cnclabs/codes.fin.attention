cost and expenses 
cost of sales for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
these increases are attributable to the shift in sales mix toward private brand products  resulting from increased promotional activities carried out by certain of the company s private brand customers  and the higher level of nutritional sales by the intergel division  which have lower profit margins than the company s core business segments 
the fourth quarter gross profit was detrimentally impacted by excess manufacturing labor caused by the unexpected volume decrease in the fourth quarter  as compared to the third quarter 
at july   the company took a physical count of all inventories and adjusted to these counts and valuations 
the above factors were partially offset by the inclusion of the vitamin specialties operations for the full year  and the increase in the gross profit margins at the portland facility attributable to new higher margin products which have been added to the line during the year

year ended july  compared to the year ended july  net sales 
net sales for the year ended july  were million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  this increase was principally attributable to growth in unit sales of most of the company s vitamin products to its core customers  the increased level of sales relative to intergel  whose operations commenced in january  new product introductions  such as the company s new line of herbal products  continued growth in the international division and the initial sales contribution from the vitamin specialties operations acquired in june of offsetting these factors was the impact of the discontinuation of the company s revlon line of licensed products and the reduced sales to revco during the second half of as a result of the termination of the supply agreement during the second quarter of the company s core business products are distributed through leading chain drug  supermarket and mass merchandising retailers

cost and expenses 
cost of sales for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in cost of sales was limited as a result of the improvement in the overall sales mix towards higher margin products such as the company s fields of nature brand and the new herbal product line  coupled with lower acquisition costs of certain raw materials attributable in part to the increased purchasing power of the company as a result of the merger with hall in april in addition  certain of the company s new product introductions  such as glucosamine and st 
john s wort  entail higher gross profit margins than the company s overall profit margins 
the above factors were offset by the lower sales levels experienced by the revlon line of licensed products which had significantly higher margins than the company s overall profit margins  coupled with the changes recorded in the fourth quarter relative to the discontinuation of the revlon line 
in addition  the higher level of sales contributed by the intergel division  which entailed lower profit margins than the company s core business segments  also contributed to the increase in overall cost of sales during in addition  the cost of sales was impacted by the increased amortization expense attributable to the increased costs associated with securing longer term customer supply agreements 
these agreements  for the most part  extend over two or three year periods  and the related costs are amortized over the expected lives of the agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  were million  an increase of million or over million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily attributable to i increased advertising and promotional activities  ii increases in sales commissions  broker fees and other selling expenses attributable to the sales growth in the company s core operations  iii increased minimum royalty payments associated with the revlon line of vitamins  iv increased distribution expenses attributable to higher levels of shipments associated with the company s core operations and intergel s sales activities  and v expenses relating to the initial operations of the intergel division 
the overall increase was partially offset by the savings resulting from the coordination of certain sales  marketing  distribution and general and administrative functions between the east coast and west coast operations subsequent to the hall merger in april  the reduced levels of advertising and promotion costs associated with the revlon product line compared to  during which time significant expenditures were incurred associated with the launch of the line

liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million at july   compared with million at july   a decrease of million 
the agreement with the bank requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum working capital 
at july   the company was in violation of certain of these covenants  which have been waived by the bank 
the company classified the entire balance due to the bank as a current liability 
the company s working capital needs  primarily related to inventory  increased levels of production of the intergel division  introduction of a new product line  increased capital expenditures  costs associated with securing long term sales contracts  as well as the acquisition of the vitamin specialties operations have been satisfied by cash flow generated from operations and bank borrowings 
inventories increased by million for the year ended july  this increase is mainly attributable to the higher level sales activities expected from existing customers  new product introductions and better customer service

year compliance program the company is in the process of addressing year or yk issues 
these issues stem from the use by many computer systems and applications of two digit date fields to designate a year  which may render them unable to distinguish years beginning with from years beginning with as a result  in the year  these systems may not accurately process certain critical financial and operational information 
ivc  like many other companies  is expected to incur expenses over the next few years to address this issue 
in the past year  the company began to implement a compliance program to deal with the yk issue 
at the same time  the company invested in a complete replacement of its internal management information systems and is replacing its information technologies infrastructure with new enterprise servers  personal computers  local area networks and wide area networks 
yk compliant systems have been utilized in half of the company s facilities since the beginning of january  with the remaining facilities scheduled to be integrated by the first quarter of calendar the company s goal is to commence the second quarter of calendar with yk compliant computer systems throughout the company 
the company also is assessing whether its other systems that are not directly related to data processing contain embedded technology that may not be yk compliant 
in addition to evaluating its own systems  the company is in the process of contacting its vendors and major suppliers to seek assurance that they will be yk compliant prior to the arrival of the new millennium 
the total costs associated with the company s compliance program are not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the company s new yk compliant management information systems would have been installed regardless of the yk issue 
however  satisfactory remediation of yk issues is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
the company s current estimates of the impact of the yk issue on its financial position do not include costs that may result from other companies failure to become yk compliant 
should the company s internal systems or the internal systems of one or more significant vendors fail to achieve yk compliance  the company s business and its operations could be materially adversely affected 
if  based on the responses to its inquiries  the company determines that any of its suppliers or vendors are not yk compliant  the company plans to arrange for alternative sources of supply 
the company believes that the products and services it purchases from its vendors and suppliers are available form numerous sources and that the loss of particular supplier would not adversely affect its operations 
however  if the company is unable to locate suppliers that are yk compliant  there could be a material adverse affect on its operations
