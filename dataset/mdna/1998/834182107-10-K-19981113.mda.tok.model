the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquisition costs operating income net interest income expense income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales the company s net sales have increased significantly in each of the past several years  reflecting the growing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
for the year ended august   net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales 
fiscal net sales of billion were greater than net sales in fiscal the sales growth in fiscal was attributable to significant increases in sales volume from both existing and new customers worldwide  including the completion of the transfer of production from certain ericsson plants to various solectron locations around the world 
the new locations in mexico  brazil and sweden and the ramp up of the massachusetts location to full production also contributed to the increase in net sales 
in addition  the acquisition of the three ncr sites and the ibm ecat manufacturing assets contributed four months and three months of sales  respectively  totaling million to the period 
the fiscal sales growth was due to significant increases in sales volume from both existing and new customers in north america  higher international sales  the acquisition of force computers in november and a full twelve months of sales from the custom manufacturing services cms business  located in austin  texas  which was acquired from texas instruments in march within the americas  the sites that benefited most from start up and major new programs had substantial increases in net sales in fiscal over fiscal sales growth at the texas and massachusetts sites was particularly strong as a result of these factors 
in addition  the new sites in mexico and brazil  as well as the newly acquired sites from ncr and ibm  contributed incremental net sales to fiscal the growth in fiscal sales over fiscal reflected increases in sales at all locations to existing and new customers 
the overall increase in sales in fiscal over fiscal was partially offset by the effect of several ongoing programs reaching end of life and management actions to improve global load balancing and transitioning specific product programs 
sales in all of the company s european and asian manufacturing locations increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of core business growth and new accounts 
sales growth in the company s location in scotland was particularly strong due to the ramp up of major customers printed circuit board assembly activities in that location 
fiscal sales in most of the company s european and asian operations increased over fiscal sales as a result of the global load balancing efforts noted above  as well as higher sales to existing and new customers 
these increases were partially offset by declines in sales during fiscal at the facility in france and some asian locations related to older programs as these programs reached end of life 
although the company does not currently anticipate any future decline in sales  to lessen the potential impact of any possible future declines to customers within any particular region or market segment  the company is committed to seeking diversification of its customer base among many countries  market segments and product lines within market segments 
several major customers accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal  and the following table lists these customers and the percentage of net sales attributed to them 
years ended august  hewlett packard company hp cisco systems  inc cisco sun microsystems  inc sun nortel networks  inc formerly bay networks  inc less than no other customers accounted for more than of net sales during any of the years presented 
solectron s top ten customers accounted for  and of consolidated net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
solectron is still dependent upon continued revenues from hp  cisco  sun and its other top ten customers and there can be no guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could have an adverse material effect on solectron s results of operations 
net sales at solectron s international sites  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  have varied over the last three fiscal years 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to the sales growth factors for europe and asia noted above  the company s fiscal international sales also benefited from the addition in fiscal of new sites in mexico and brazil and the acquisition of the site in ireland from ncr in april in fiscal  international sales decreased as a percentage of consolidated sales due to strong growth in domestic sales  aided by the acquisition of the cms business in austin  texas  which is substantially comprised of domestic sales  as well as the end of life issues described above 
as a result of solectron s international sales and facilities  solectron s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad 
while to date these dynamics have not had an adverse material effect on solectron s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
see trends and uncertainties international operations  foreign exchange rate sensitivity and euro conversion issues for further discussion of potential fluctuations in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
solectron s operations in milpitas  california contributed a substantial portion of solectron s net sales and operating income during fiscal  and in recent quarters  management has undertaken deliberate actions to achieve improved global load balancing by transferring certain projects from the milpitas site to other sites worldwide 
however  the performance of the milpitas operation is expected to continue to be a significant factor in the overall financial performance of solectron 
any adverse material change to the customer base  product mix  efficiency or other attributes of this site could have an adverse material effect on solectron s consolidated results of operations 
solectron believes that its ability to continue achieving growth will depend upon growth in sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successful marketing to new customers and future geographic expansion 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of solectron s current customers will continue to utilize solectron s services 
because of these factors  there can be no assurance that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
see trends and uncertainties for a discussion of certain factors affecting the management of growth  geographic expansion and potential fluctuations in sales and results of operations 
gross profit the gross margin percentage was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to a shift toward higher volume projects and systems build projects that typically have lower margins  as well as start up costs associated with the company s operations in china and mexico 
in addition  gross margins of the newly acquired ncr operations are lower than the overall average margins of the rest of the company primarily due to the fact that the majority of its net sales are derived from systems integration activities  which normally generate lower gross margins than printed circuit board assembly  as well as current underutilization of these facilities 
the improvement in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of force since its acquisition in november gross profit margins on force s products are significantly higher than those of the rest of the company 
without force s contribution  gross margins for fiscal would have been 
in addition to the impact of force  the improved gross margin percentage in fiscal reflects a shift in product mix toward the higher margin market segments  projects with a higher than normal consignment content and increased manufacturing efficiencies at the dunfermline  scotland and austin  texas sites 
for the foreseeable future  solectron s gross margin is expected to depend primarily on product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  the percentage of sales derived from systems build projects  pricing within the electronics industry and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for the company as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
the company anticipates that a larger percentage of its sales may be derived from systems build projects in future periods 
systems build projects typically have lower gross margin percentages than printed circuit board assembly projects 
increases in systems build business  additional costs associated with new projects and price erosion within the electronics industry could adversely affect the company s gross margin 
additionally  changes in product mix could cause the company s gross margin to fluctuate 
also  while the availability of raw materials appears adequate to meet the company s current revenue projections for the foreseeable future  component availability is still subject to lead time and other constraints that could possibly limit the company s revenue growth 
because of these factors and others discussed under trends and uncertainties below  there can be no assurance that the company s gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal the fiscal increase and a portion of the fiscal increase was due to investment in infrastructure such as personnel and related departmental expenses at all manufacturing locations as well as continuing investment in information systems to support the increased size and complexity of the company s business 
the inclusion of force since its acquisition in november and the austin  texas site for the full year of fiscal accounted for approximately half of the fiscal increase 
the addition in fiscal and of new sites in china  massachusetts  mexico  brazil and sweden and the ncr and ibm sites also contributed to the growth in sg a expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates sg a expenses will continue to increase in terms of absolute dollars in the future  and may possibly increase as a percentage of net sales  as the company continues to build the infrastructure necessary to support its current and prospective business 
research and development expenses with the exception of its force computers operation  the company s research and development r d activities have been focused primarily on the development of prototype and engineering design capabilities  fine pitch interconnecting technologies which include ball grid array  tape automated bonding  multichip modules  chip on flex  chip on board and flip chip  high reliability environmental stress test technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes  such as voc free and no clean 
force s r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and the use of microprocessors in embedded applications 
research and development expenses  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  respectively  were million and in fiscal  million and in fiscal and million and in fiscal the increase in r d expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased r d efforts at force 
the fiscal increase over fiscal was a result of the acquisition of force in november the company expects that r d expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future and may increase as a percentage of net sales as force and the newly acquired ncr and ibm sites continue to invest in their r d efforts 
in addition  certain new r d projects will be undertaken at some of the company s asian sites  particularly at the malaysia sites in connection with the tax holiday 
see income taxes 
acquisition costs a one time charge for acquisition costs of approximately million was incurred in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of force computers in november net interest income expense net interest income was zero in fiscal and million in fiscal compared to net interest expense of million in fiscal the company issued convertible subordinated notes in february and senior notes in march interest expense on the debt is approximately million annually and in fiscal and was offset by interest earned on undeployed cash and investments 
in fiscal  the company capitalized approximately million of interest expense related to construction of its new facilities in china and mexico 
the company used a portion of its cash and short term investments to fund its acquisitions from ncr and ibm 
solectron expects to utilize more of the undeployed cash during future periods in order to fund anticipated future growth 
see trends and uncertainties management of growth and potential fluctuations in operating results 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to increased income before income taxes 
solectron s effective income tax rate decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
solectron s international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to the tax holiday granted to the company s malaysia sites 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through january   subject to certain conditions  including certain levels of research and development expenditures 
the company has also been granted various tax holidays in china  which are effective for various terms and are subject to certain conditions 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was billion at august  compared to million at the end of fiscal a major component of working capital at august  continued to be undeployed cash from the proceeds of the two debt offerings during fiscal in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company used approximately million of its cash and short term investments to fund its acquisitions of the ncr and ibm ecat manufacturing assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company used additional funds for its acquisition of the wireless telephone manufacturing assets of mcea s cmt division 
as solectron continues to grow  it is expected that the company will require greater amounts of working capital to support its operations 
the company believes that its current level of working capital  together with cash generated from operations and the company s available credit facilities  will provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  the company may need to raise additional funds to finance more rapid expansion  including establishing new locations or financing additional acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such funds  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
inventory levels fluctuate directly with the volume of the company s manufacturing 
changes or significant fluctuations in product market demands can cause fluctuations in inventory levels that may result in changes in levels of inventory turns and liquidity 
historically  the company has been able to manage its inventory levels with regard to these fluctuations 
however  should material fluctuations occur in product demand  the company could experience slower turns and reduced liquidity 
the increase in inventory levels at year end from year end is substantially a result of overall growth and the greater number of manufacturing locations at august  compared to august   as each location must maintain a level of inventory adequate to allow the location to respond to customer manufacturing requirements 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by increases in net income  depreciation and amortization and current liabilities 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal reflects increased net income  depreciation and amortization and current liabilities balances  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
a large portion of these expenditures related to the purchase of new equipment  primarily surface mount assembly and test equipment  to meet current and expected production levels  as well as to replace or upgrade older equipment that was retired or sold 
significant expenditures were also made for the acquisition of land and buildings for the company s new manufacturing sites  principally in china  mexico and brazil 
the company expects capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
during fiscal  the company entered into an arrangement with a third party leasing company under which certain of the company s fixed assets have been sold to the leasing company and leased back 
the company is accounting for these transactions as operating leases 
in addition to working capital as of august   which included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  the company has available a million unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires in april and a million asset securitization arrangement that expires in august both of these facilities are subject to financial covenants 
the company also has approximately million in available foreign credit facilities 
year issues the company is aware of and is addressing the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as many computer systems  manufacturing equipment and industrial control systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such dates could generate erroneous information or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on business transactions worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems  manufacturing equipment and industrial control systems would have an adverse material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company has formed a worldwide task force and has implemented a comprehensive program to analyze the company s internal systems as well as all external systems such as vendor  customer  banking systems  etc 
upon which the company is dependent  to identify and evaluate any potential year issues 
this task force meets regularly and tracks progress against the program  modifying it as needed to help ensure timely completion 
the company is committed to achieving year compliance  however  because a significant portion of the problem is external to the company and therefore outside of its direct control  there can be no assurances that the company will be fully or even significantly year compliant at the critical juncture 
in addition  as full testing of year functionality must occur in a simulated environment  the company will not be able to test full system year interfaces and capabilities prior to the year as of the end of fiscal  the company had completed an inventory of internal systems  hardware  software  manufacturing equipment and embedded chips in industrial control instruments 
each of these items was identified as mission critical  mission essential  mission impaired or mission non critical 
the company is in the process of prioritizing and evaluating mission critical and mission essential items  identifying fixes and resources as appropriate  and performing and testing corrective measures 
while the company believes that its evaluation has been comprehensive  there can be no assurance that all systems critical to year compliance have been identified  or that the corrective actions identified will be completed on time 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had inventoried every key supplier of goods and services to the company  and considered the potential impact on the company and its customers of year compliance by these suppliers 
the company also mailed surveys to many of these key suppliers  and is in the process of evaluating responses and sending follow up letters 
the company plans to disqualify potentially non compliant sources  look for alternative sources and re qualify new suppliers to help mediate potential business disruptions 
the company is also involved with various geographic year consortiums worldwide  with the intent to leverage contacts and information for commonly used suppliers and services such as utility companies 
in addition  the company is in the process of reviewing edi linkages and data transmission for its customers and suppliers 
while the company believes that it will be able to qualify alternative suppliers as needed  until all supplier and customer survey responses have been received and evaluated  the company can not fully evaluate the extent of potential problems and the costs associated with corrective actions 
the company estimates the cost to complete its current compliance program to be in the range of million to million 
of this amount  approximately million is associated with the replacement of capital equipment  of which approximately half is being purchased to replace non compliant systems that would not otherwise have been replaced at this time 
the variability in these estimates depends largely on the response from the company s suppliers and the extent to which supplier re qualification is needed 
cost estimates will also be re evaluated as the status of the overall compliance program is updated 
there can be no assurance that actual costs will not be materially higher than currently anticipated 
a significant portion of these costs is not likely to be incremental costs to the company  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
certain other information technology projects have been delayed due to the focus on year issues 
the potential costs of the redeployment of personnel and delays in implementing other projects is not known but could be substantial 
although the company has identified general contingency plans  such as the replacement and re qualification of suppliers  the stockpiling of supplies and purchase of generators  a formal contingency plan will not be established until at least the third quarter of fiscal when the evaluation of suppliers is expected to be completed 
the company is unable to determine what effect the failure of systems because of year issues by the company or its suppliers or customers will have  but any significant failures could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
trends and uncertainties customer concentration  dependence on the electronics industry in fiscal  and  the company s ten largest customers accounted for as much as of consolidated net sales 
the company is dependent upon continued revenues from its top ten customers 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other significant customers could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
during fiscal  hp  cisco and sun accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales  compared to for hp and less than for each of cisco and sun during fiscal there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do business with hp  cisco  sun or any other customer 
the percentage of the company s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers would have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has long term contracts generally for terms of three to five years with ericsson  ncr  ibm and mitsubishi under which these customers have committed to source production of certain products and components from the company 
however  these commitments to source production do not include firm volume purchase commitments 
in addition  the company has no firm long term volume purchase commitments from its other customers  and over the past few years has experienced reduced lead times in customer orders 
also  customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured 
these risks are increased because a majority of the company s sales are to customers in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the factors affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of the company s major customers in particular  could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that sales to customers within any particular market segment will not experience decreases that could have an adverse effect on the company s sales 
management of growth  geographic expansion the company has experienced substantial growth over the last five fiscal years  with net sales increasing from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal year in recent years  the company has acquired or established facilities in many locations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced the opening of its asia pacific headquarters office in taipei  taiwan  began operations in guadalajara  mexico  and as further discussed in partnership with ericsson and related transactions  established a manufacturing facility near sao paulo  brazil and opened a new product introduction center in sweden 
in april  the company announced plans to open a manufacturing facility in timisoara  romania  and in may  announced the establishment of a program office in israel 
in addition  in april  june and october  the company completed its acquisitions of certain manufacturing facilities and associates from ncr  ibm and mitsubishi  respectively 
see acquisition of ncr  ibm and mitsubishi assets 
in october  the company signed a definitive agreement with ingram micro  inc under which the two companies will enter into a strategic alliance 
see alliance with ingram micro 
during fiscal  the company announced the establishment of new manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china  began operations at its manufacturing facility near boston  massachusetts  and in november  acquired force computers inc  which has operations in california and germany 
the company continually evaluates growth and acquisition opportunities and may pursue additional opportunities over time 
there can be no assurance that the company s historical revenue growth will continue or that the company will successfully manage the facilities in china  mexico  brazil and romania  the partnership with and acquisitions from ericsson  the acquisitions from ncr  ibm and mitsubishi  the alliance with ingram micro or any other businesses or assets it may acquire in the future 
as the company manages its existing operations and expands geographically  it may experience certain inefficiencies as it integrates new operations and manages geographically dispersed operations 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if its new facilities do not achieve growth sufficient to offset increased expenditures associated with geographic expansion 
the company s expenses and working capital requirements will continue to increase as the new facilities become fully operational and the transaction with mitsubishi is completed 
should the company increase its expenditures in anticipation of a future level of sales that does not materialize  its profitability would be adversely affected 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production that can place an excessive burden on the company s resources 
partnership with ericsson and related transactions during  the company established a strategic  global manufacturing partnership with ericsson telecom ab s business area infocom systems 
the company established a new product introduction center in sweden  and production from certain ericsson plants worldwide was transferred to solectron manufacturing sites around the world 
in october  solectron acquired certain assets  primarily equipment and inventory  of ericsson s printed circuit board assembly operation located in brazil 
in addition  solectron s subsidiary  solectron brasil ltda  hired approximately associates formerly employed by ericsson telecomunicacoes sa in brazil 
under the terms of the agreement  ericsson contracted for solectron s services from solectron brasil ltda 
through september thereafter  solectron will bear the risk of filling the manufacturing capacity at the site with renewed business from ericsson and new business from other customers 
the transactions with ericsson entail a number of risks  including successfully managing the integration of the operations  retention of key associates  integrating purchasing operations and information systems  managing an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business and renewing the ericsson business or replacing it with new business after expiration of the ericsson commitment 
in addition  the completion of the transactions with ericsson has increased solectron s expenses and working capital requirements and there is no assurance that solectron will achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses 
there can be no assurance that solectron will successfully manage the risks of these transactions 
acquisitions of ncr  ibm and mitsubishi assets on april   the company acquired ncr s manufacturing assets in three cities  two in the united states and one in ireland  for a purchase price of approximately million  subject to adjustment 
as part of the transaction  solectron hired approximately  ncr manufacturing and related support associates currently employed at these locations 
under the terms of the agreement  ncr will outsource the manufacturing of certain computer  computer peripheral and server components to solectron for at least five years 
thereafter  solectron will bear the risk of filling the manufacturing capacity at the sites with renewed business from ncr and new business from other customers 
on june   the company acquired ibm s ecat manufacturing assets in charlotte  north carolina and non exclusive rights to certain ibm intellectual property for a purchase price of approximately million  subject to adjustment 
under the terms of the agreement  solectron hired approximately ibm manufacturing and related support associates and the company will provide printed circuit board assembly services to ibm in north america for the next three years 
in addition  ibm has made available to solectron patents and disclosures collectively the intellectual property rights covering a wide spectrum of technologies and capabilities 
ibm will also provide to solectron failure analysis and characterization tools for process development and manufacturing  including fault detection and isolation 
on october   the company acquired the wireless telephone manufacturing assets of mitsubishi consumer electronics america  inc s mcea cellular mobile telephone cmt division in braselton  georgia 
mcea is a subsidiary of mitsubishi electric corporation mitsubishi 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will provide mcea cmt with a full range of manufacturing services for five years  including new product introduction management  printed circuit board assembly and full systems assembly for mcea s branded and private label cellular products sold within north america 
in addition  solectron has hired approximately mcea cmt manufacturing and support associates 
the transactions with ncr  ibm and mitsubishi entail a number of risks  including successfully managing the integration of the operations  retention of key associates  integrating purchasing operations and information systems  managing an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business  obtaining customers other than ncr  ibm and mitsubishi for these facilities and renewing each of the ncr  ibm and mitsubishi business or replacing it with new business after expiration of ncr s  ibm s and mitsubishi s respective commitments 
in addition  the transactions with ncr  ibm and mitsubishi will increase solectron s expenses and working capital requirements and there is no assurance that solectron will achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses 
there can be no assurance that solectron will successfully manage the risks of these transactions 
alliance with ingram micro on october   the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with ingram micro inc under which the two companies will enter into a strategic alliance to provide global build to order and configure to order assembly services for personal computers  servers and related products in the united states  canada  europe  asia and latin america 
the alliance will be managed by both companies under a joint management matrix that will include a sales and marketing staff  program management  information technology resources and test and process engineers and will  in most part  utilize existing facilities  systems and personnel 
the alliance with ingram micro entails a number of risks  including successfully establishing the joint management matrix for the alliance  retention of key associates  integrating purchasing operations and information systems and obtaining customers for the services to be provided by the alliance 
in addition  the alliance with ingram micro will increase solectron s expenses and working capital requirements and there is no assurance that solectron will achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses 
there can be no assurance that solectron will successfully manage the risks of this alliance or that the terms of the alliance will be finalized 
international operations as a result of its international sales and facilities  the company s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad  including but not limited to  fluctuations in the value of currency  export duties  changes to import and export regulations including quotas  possible restrictions on the transfer of funds  associate turnover  labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and in certain parts of the world  political instability 
in addition  the company has operations in several locations that are considered to have highly inflationary economies or volatile currencies  including mexico  brazil  china and romania 
while to date these factors have not had an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
southeast asia and latin america are currently experiencing currency  economic and political instability 
to date  the company s operations have not experienced significant adverse effects from this instability 
however  to the extent the company s worldwide customers sell the products manufactured by solectron into the southeast asia and latin america markets  the customers sales may be adversely affected  which could decrease demand for the company s manufacturing services 
the company cannot predict whether such a decrease in demand will materialize and if it does  whether it will have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
the malaysian government recently adopted currency exchange controls  including controls on ringgit held outside malaysia  and established a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit against the us dollar 
the company does not hold ringgit outside of malaysia and therefore will not be affected by these controls 
the fixed exchange rate  when applied to local expenses denominated in ringgit  will result in higher expenses when translated to us dollars 
however  such local expenses represent a small percentage of the company s total costs and therefore the company s results of operations will not be significantly affected in the near future 
the long term impact of such controls is not predictable due to dynamic economic conditions that also affect or are affected by other regional or global economies 
the company has been granted a tax holiday for its malaysia sites which is effective through january   subject to certain conditions 
the company has also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to certain conditions 
there is no assurance that the current tax holidays will not be terminated or modified or that any future tax holidays that the company may seek will be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future  the company s effective income tax rate would likely increase 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company s policy is to hedge its foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the currency risks of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
there were no material deferred gains or losses at august   and the company does not hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
in addition  the company s international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
however  because less than of net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the company does not believe its total exposure to be significant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
euro conversion issues on january   of the member countries of the european union the participating countries are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
for three years after the introduction of the euro  the participating countries can perform financial transactions in either the euro or their original local currencies 
this will result in a fixed exchange rate among the participating countries  whereas the euro and the participating countries currencies in tandem will continue to float freely against the us dollar and other currencies of non participating countries 
the company has established a task force that is evaluating the effects of the euro conversion on the company and monitoring its readiness for the conversion 
the company does not believe that significant modifications of its information technology systems will be needed in order to handle euro transactions and reporting  and the company is in the process of evaluating its tax positions and all outstanding contracts in currencies of the participating countries to determine the effects  if any  of the euro conversion 
the company does not expect the euro conversion to have a significant impact on its derivatives see note of notes to consolidated financial statements as the company has already modified its hedging policies to take the euro conversion into account  and approximately of its derivative instruments at august   mature in three months or less 
while the company believes that it will be ready for the euro conversion by the end of calendar  and that the effects of the conversion will not have a significant adverse material effect on the company s business and operations  there can be no assurances that such conversion will not have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations and financial position due to competitive and other factors that may be affected by the conversion that cannot be predicted by the company 
availability of components a substantial portion of the company s net sales is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which the company provides both materials procurement and assembly 
in turnkey manufacturing  the company potentially bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
at various times there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
if significant shortages of components should occur  the company may be forced to delay manufacturing and shipments  which could have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the mix of turnkey and consignment projects  the mix of printed circuit board assembly and systems build projects  capacity utilization  price competition  the degree of automation that can be used in the assembly process  the efficiencies that can be achieved by the company in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of orders from major customers  fluctuations in demand for customer products  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements  and increased costs and shortages of components or labor 
turnkey manufacturing currently represents a substantial portion of solectron s sales 
turnkey projects  in which solectron procures some or all of the components necessary for production  typically generate higher net sales and higher gross profits with lower gross margin percentages than consignment projects due to the inclusion in solectron s operating results of sales and costs associated with the purchase and sale of components 
solectron assembles products with varying degrees of material content  which may cause solectron s gross margin to fluctuate 
in addition  the degree of start up costs and inefficiencies associated with new sites and new customer projects may affect solectron s gross margin 
all of these factors can cause fluctuations in the company s operating results 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   approximately of the company s total portfolio matures in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the amounts of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of august  total fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents and short term investments     average interest rates the company s debt instruments are subject to fixed interest rates and  in the case of the convertible notes  to fixed conversion ratios into the company s common stock 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
therefore  the company is not subject to market risk from its debt instruments

competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is comprised of a large number of companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
the company also faces competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate solectron s capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
solectron competes with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area 
certain competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that the primary bases of competition in its targeted markets are manufacturing technology  quality  responsiveness  the provision of value added services and price 
to be competitive  the company must provide technologically advanced manufacturing services  high product quality levels  flexible delivery schedules and reliable delivery of finished products on a timely and price competitive basis 
the company currently may be at a competitive disadvantage as to price when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures  particularly with respect to manufacturers with established facilities where labor costs are lower 
intellectual property protection the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company holds a limited number of us patents related to the process and equipment used in its surface mount technology 
the company s subsidiary  force computers  also holds a number of patents related to vme technology 
the company believes these patents are valuable 
however  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide meaningful protection for the company s manufacturing process and equipment innovations or force s technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or its customers in the future  either against the patents the company holds itself or against the ibm patents that the company has access to 
in the event a third party does assert an infringement claim  the company may be required to expend significant resources to develop a non infringing manufacturing process or technology or to obtain licenses to the manufacturing process or technology that is the subject of litigation 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that any such licenses would be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could have an adverse material effect on the company s financial condition regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
environmental compliance the company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
dependence on key personnel and skilled associates the company s continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
the loss of services of certain key personnel could have an adverse material effect on the company 
the company s business also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could adversely affect the company s operations 
possible volatility of market price of common stock the trading price of the common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general conditions in the electronics industry and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that affect the market price for many high technology companies in particular  and that often are unrelated to operating performance
