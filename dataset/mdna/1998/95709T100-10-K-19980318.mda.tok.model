nuclear fuel is amortized to cost of sales based on the quantity of heat produced for the generation of electricity 
under the nuclear waste policy act of  the department of energy doe is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
the company pays the doe a quarterly fee of one tenth of a cent for each kilowatt hour of net nuclear generation delivered and sold for future disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
these disposal costs are charged to cost of sales and currently recovered through rates 
in  a us court of appeals issued a decision that the nuclear waste act unconditionally obligated the doe to begin accepting spent fuel for disposal in in late  the same court issued another decision precluding the doe from concluding that its delay in accepting spent fuel is unavoidable under its contracts with utilities due to lack of a repository or interim storage authority 
by the end of  kge and other utilities had petitioned the doe for authority to suspend payments of their quarterly fees until such time as the doe begins accepting spent fuel 
in january  the doe denied the petition of the utilities 
a permanent disposal site may not be available for the industry until or later  although an interim facility may be available earlier 
under current doe policy  once a permanent site is available  the doe will accept spent nuclear fuel on a priority basis  the owners of the oldest spent fuel will be given the highest priority 
as a result  disposal services for wolf creek may not be available prior to wolf creek has on site temporary storage for spent nuclear fuel 
under current regulatory guidelines  this facility can provide storage space until about wolf creek has started plans to increase its on site spent fuel storage capacity 
that project  expected to be completed by  should provide storage capacity for all spent fuel expected to be generated by wolf creek through the end of its licensed life in the low level radioactive waste policy amendments act of mandated that the various states  individually or through interstate compacts  develop alternative low level radioactive waste disposal facilities 
the states of kansas  nebraska  arkansas  louisiana and oklahoma formed the central interstate low level radioactive waste compact and selected a site in northern nebraska to locate a disposal facility 
the present estimate of the cost for such a facility is about million 
wcnoc and the owners of the other five nuclear units in the compact have provided most of the pre construction financing for this project 
there is uncertainty as to whether this project will be completed 
significant opposition to the project has been raised by nebraska officials and residents in the area of the proposed facility  and attempts have been made through litigation and proposed legislation in nebraska to slow down or stop development of the facility

highlights gain on sale of equity securities during the third quarter of  we sold all of our tyco international ltd 
tyco common shares for approximately billion 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the sale which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of income 
we recorded tax expense of approximately million in connection with this gain 
the tax on the gain is included in income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
as discussed further in financial condition below  this significantly affected our financial results for see note 
purchase of protection one  inc 
on july   we agreed to combine our security alarm monitoring business with protection one  inc protection one  a publicly held security alarm monitoring provider 
on november   we completed the transaction by contributing approximately million in security alarm monitoring business net assets and approximately million in cash 
the cash contributed included funds used for a special dividend of per common share to protection one shareowners  option holders and warrant holders other than western resources 
in exchange for our net security alarm monitoring business assets and cash  we received ownership in protection one 
we entered the security alarm monitoring business to make our company more diverse and to achieve growth 
in december  protection one recorded a special non recurring charge of approximately million 
approximately million of this charge reflects the elimination of redundant facilities and activities and the write off of inventory and other assets which are no longer of continuing value to protection one 
the remaining million of this charge reflects the estimated costs to transition all security alarm monitoring operations to the protection one brand 
protection one intends to complete these activities by the fourth quarter of strategic alliance with oneok inc 
on december   we agreed to form a strategic alliance with oneok inc oneok to combine the natural gas assets of both companies 
in november  we completed this strategic alliance 
we contributed substantially all of our regulated and non regulated natural gas business net assets totaling approximately million to a new company which merged with oneok and adopted the name oneok 
oneok operates its natural gas business in kansas using the name kansas gas service company 
in exchange for our contribution  we received a ownership interest in oneok 
the structure of the strategic alliance had no immediate income tax consequences to our company or our shareowners 
our ownership interest in oneok is comprised of million common shares and approximately million convertible preferred shares 
if we converted all the preferred shares  we would own approximately of oneok s common shares presently outstanding 
our agreement with oneok allowed us to appoint two members to oneok s board of directors 
oneok currently pays a common dividend of per share 
the initial annual dividend rate on the convertible preferred shares is per share 
merger agreement with kansas city power light company on february   we entered into a merger agreement with kansas city power light company kcpl 
the merger agreement contemplated a tax free  stock for stock exchange valued at approximately billion or in value for each common share of kcpl 
in december  representatives of our financial advisor indicated that they believed it was unlikely that they would be in a position to issue a required fairness opinion for the merger on the basis of the previously announced terms 
we canceled our shareowner meeting scheduled for january  to approve the merger 
kcpl canceled a similar meeting for its shareowners 
we and kcpl have met to discuss alternative terms of a potential merger 
we cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of these discussions 
on january   the kansas corporation commission kcc issued an order suspending the merger proceedings and waived an eight month time requirement to approve the merger 
on january   the missouri public service commission mpsc issued an order suspending the merger proceedings 
we and kcpl have agreed to these suspensions 
on january   we asked the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to hold the docket on our proposed merger in abeyance until april   at which time we will advise the ferc whether to continue to hold the docket in abeyance or that a new agreement has been reached with kcpl 
as of december   we had spent and deferred on the consolidated balance sheet approximately million in our efforts to acquire kcpl 
we had planned to expense these costs in the first period following the merger 
given the status of the kcpl transaction  we have reviewed the deferred costs and have determined that for accounting purposes  million of the deferred costs should be expensed 
we recorded a special non recurring charge of million after taxes  or per share in december  to expense the costs that were incurred solely as a result of the original merger agreement 
at december   we had deferred approximately million related to the kcpl transaction currently being negotiated 
see financial condition below and note other security alarm monitoring business purchases we acquired network multi family security corporation network multi family  a security alarm monitoring provider for multi unit dwellings based in dallas  texas  for approximately million in cash in september on february   protection one exercised its option to acquire the stock of network holdings  inc  the parent company of network multi family  from us for approximately million 
we expect this transaction to occur in the first quarter of we expect protection one to borrow money from a revolving credit agreement provided by westar capital  a subsidiary of western resources  to purchase network multi family 
in november  we acquired centennial security holdings  inc centennial for approximately million in cash 
centennial is based in madison  new jersey and provides security alarm monitoring services to more than  customers in ohio  michigan  new jersey  new york and pennsylvania 
we contributed our centennial security alarm monitoring business to protection one on november  in march  protection one acquired the subscribers and assets of wichita  kansas based multimedia security services  inc multimedia security services  inc has approximately  subscribers concentrated primarily in california  florida  kansas  oklahoma and texas 
we expect protection one to borrow money from a revolving credit agreement provided by westar capital to complete this transaction 
other investments in december  we invested million to acquire an interest in two megawatt power plants in the people s republic of china 
we invested approximately million in power projects in the republic of turkey and colombia in see note 
we also invested in other miscellaneous investments 
electric rate decrease on may   we reduced our electric rates to kansas gas and electric company kge customers by million annually on an interim basis 
on october   the kcc staff  the city of wichita  the citizens utility ratepayer board and we filed an agreement asking the kcc to reduce our retail electric rates 
the kcc approved this agreement on january  per the agreement we made permanent the may interim million decrease in kge rates on february  we reduced kge s rates by million annually on february  we reduced kpl s rates by million annually on february  we rebated million to all of our electric customers in january we will reduce kge s rates by million more annually on june  we will rebate million to all of our electric customers in january we will reduce kge s rates by million more annually on june  all rate decreases are cumulative 
rebates are one time events and do not influence future rates 
see financial condition below and note financial condition compared to earnings increased to million for from million for  an improvement of 
basic earnings per share rose to for compared to for  an increase of 
basic earnings per share is calculated based upon the average weighted number of common shares outstanding during the period 
there were no significant amounts of dilutive securities outstanding at december  or four factors primarily affected earnings and basic earnings per share compared to the gain on the sale of the tyco common stock increased earnings before taxes by million and basic earnings per share by the write off of approximately million in costs related to the kcpl merger decreased basic earnings per share by the operating results and special one time charges from our first full year of security alarm monitoring business reduced earnings by million and basic earnings per share by our reduced electric rates implemented on february  decreased revenues by million and basic earnings per share by dividends declared for increased four cents per common share to per share 
on january   the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per common share for the first quarter of  an increase of one cent from the previous quarter 
our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december  the closing stock price of was of book value and higher than the closing price of on december  book value is the total common stock equity divided by the common shares outstanding at december there were  common shares outstanding at december  compared to basic earnings per share were based on  average common shares for  a decrease from in net income for decreased to million from million 
the decrease in basic earnings per share and net income is primarily due to the impact of an million or per share charge  net of tax  attributable to one time restructuring and other charges recorded by adt limited adt 
abnormally cool summer weather during the third quarter of and the million electric rate decrease to kge customers also lowered earnings 
operating results in our highlights  we discussed five factors that most significantly changed our operating results for compared to the following explains significant changes from prior year results in revenues  cost of sales  operating expenses  other income expense  interest expense  income taxes and preferred and preference dividends 
after  because of the oneok alliance  we will no longer separately report natural gas operations financial information in our financial statements  or in our management s discussion and analysis 
also  we had minimal security alarm monitoring business operations in and  therefore  we do not discuss variations relating to it between and sales energy revenues include electric revenues  power marketing revenues  natural gas revenues and other insignificant energy related revenues 
certain state regulatory commissions and the ferc authorize rates for our electric revenues 
our energy revenues vary with levels of sales volume 
changing weather affects the amount of energy our customers use 
very hot summers and very cold winters prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather reduces demand 
many things will affect our future energy sales 
they include the weather our electric rates competitive forces customer conservation efforts wholesale demand the overall economy of our service area compared to electric revenues increased three percent because of revenues of million from the expansion of power marketing activity in our involvement in electric power marketing anticipates a deregulated electric utility industry 
we are involved in both the marketing of electricity and risk management services to wholesale electric customers and the purchase of electricity for our retail customers 
our margin from power marketing activity is significantly less than our margins on other energy sales 
our power marketing activity has resulted in energy purchases and sales made in areas outside of our historical marketing territory 
in  this additional power marketing activity had an insignificant effect on operating income 
higher electric revenues from power marketing were offset by our reduced electric rates implemented february  reduced electric rates lowered revenues by an estimated million compared to the rate decreases we have agreed to make will impact future revenues 
natural gas revenues decreased million or seven percent in compared to because we transferred our net natural gas business assets to oneok as of november  and we had warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of in december  we began reporting investment income for oneok based upon our common and preferred equity interests 
security alarm monitoring business revenues increased million from our minimal security alarm monitoring business revenues 
this increase is because of our december   purchase of the net assets of westinghouse security systems  inc westinghouse security systems and our acquisition on november   of of protection one 
as a result  we have included a full year of operating results from westinghouse security systems and one month of operating results from protection one 
see highlights above and note compared to electric revenues were five percent higher in compared to our service territory experienced colder winter and warmer spring temperatures during the first six months of compared to  which yielded higher sales in the residential and commercial customer classes 
we experienced a increase in heating degree days during the first quarter of and had double the cooling degree days during the second quarter of compared to the same periods in partially offsetting the increase in electric revenues was abnormally cool summer weather during the third quarter of compared to and a kcc ordered electric rate decrease of million for kge customers see note 
colder winter temperatures  higher natural gas costs passed on to customers as permitted by the kcc and more as available natural gas sales increased regulated natural gas revenues for as compared to the natural gas revenue increase approved by the kcc on july   raised regulated natural gas revenues million for the last six months of cost of sales items included in energy cost of sales are fuel expense  purchased power expense electricity we purchase from others for resale  power marketing expense and natural gas purchased 
items included in security alarm monitoring cost of sales are the cost of direct monitoring and the cost of installing security monitoring equipment that is not capitalized 
compared to energy business cost of sales was million or six percent higher 
our power marketing activity in increased energy cost of sales by million 
actual cost of fuel to generate electricity coal  nuclear fuel  natural gas or oil and the amount of power purchased from other utilities were million higher in than in our wolf creek nuclear generating station was off line in the fourth quarter of for scheduled maintenance and our la cygne coal generation station was off line during for an extended maintenance outage 
as a result  we burned more natural gas to generate electricity at our facilities 
natural gas is more costly to burn than coal and nuclear fuel for generating electricity 
railroad transportation limitations prevented scheduled fuel deliveries  reducing our coal inventories 
to compensate for low coal inventories  we purchased more power from other utilities and burned more expensive natural gas to meet our energy requirements 
we also purchased more power from other utilities because our wolf creek and la cygne generating stations were not generating electricity for parts of due to the contribution of our natural gas business to oneok  our natural gas cost of sales decreased million 
we will no longer reflect such costs in our financial statements 
the security alarm monitoring cost of sales increased million 
the increase is a result of the purchase of the assets of westinghouse security systems on december   and our acquisition on november   of of protection one 
compared to energy business cost of sales was million higher in than we purchased more power from other utilities because our wolf creek nuclear generating station was off line in the first quarter of for a planned refueling outage 
higher net generation due to warmer weather and higher customer demand for air conditioning during the second quarter of also contributed to the higher fuel and purchased power expenses 
security alarm monitoring cost of sales increased million due to the purchases of several small security alarm monitoring companies 
operating expenses operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased slightly from to operating and maintenance expense increased million or six percent from to due to expenses associated with our regulated natural gas transmission service provider  mid continent market center 
depreciation and amortization expense the amortization of capitalized security alarm monitoring accounts and goodwill for our security alarm monitoring business increased our depreciation and amortization expense approximately million for versus a full year of amortization of the acquisition adjustment for the acquisition of kge increased our depreciation and amortization expense for compared to by approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense has increased million from to higher employee benefit costs of approximately million and higher security alarm monitoring business selling  general and administrative expense of approximately million caused this increase 
the security alarm monitoring business increase is because of our december   purchase of the assets of westinghouse security systems and our acquisition on november   of of protection one 
other we recorded a special non recurring charge in december to expense million of deferred kcpl merger costs 
protection one recorded a special non recurring charge of approximately million in december  to reflect the phase out of certain business activities which are no longer of continuing value to protection one  to eliminate redundant facilities and activities and to bring all customers under the protection one brand 
other income expense other income expense includes miscellaneous income and expenses not directly related to our operations 
the gain on the sale of tyco common stock increased other income million for compared to other income expense decreased slightly from to interest expense interest expense includes the interest we paid on outstanding debt 
we recognized million more short term debt interest in than in average short term debt balances were higher in than because we used short term debt to finance our investment in adt and to purchase the assets of westinghouse security systems 
short term debt interest expense declined in the second half of after we used the proceeds from the sale of tyco common stock and a long term debt financing to reduce our short term debt balance 
from december   to december   our short term debt balance decreased million 
from to  interest recorded on long term debt increased million or due to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes 
we had million more in interest expense on short term and other debt in than in because we used short term debt to finance our investment in adt and we issued western resources obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts 
we also recognized million more long term debt interest in compared to due to a higher revolving credit agreement balance 
income taxes income taxes on the gain from the sale of tyco common stock increased total income tax expense by approximately million for compared to income taxes did not vary significantly from to preferred and preference dividends we redeemed all of our preference stock due on july   therefore  preferred and preference dividends were million lower compared to preferred and preference dividends varied slightly from to liquidity and capital resources overview most of our cash requirements consist of capital expenditures and maintenance costs associated with the electric utility business  continued growth in the security alarm monitoring business  payment of common stock dividends and investments in foreign power projects 
our ability to attract necessary financial capital on reasonable terms is critical to our overall business plan 
historically  we have paid for acquisitions with cash on hand  or the issuance of stock or short term debt 
our ability to provide the cash  stock or debt to fund our capital expenditures depends upon many things  including available resources  our financial condition and current market conditions 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we consider highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million from december   due to cash held by protection one 
other than operations  our primary source of short term cash is from short term bank loans  unsecured lines of credit and the sale of commercial paper 
at december   we had approximately million of short term debt outstanding  of which million was commercial paper 
an additional million of short term debt was available from committed credit arrangements 
other funds are available to us from the sale of securities we register for sale with the securities and exchange commission sec 
as of december   these included million of western resources first mortgage bonds which may also be issued as unsecured senior notes at our option  million of kge first mortgage bonds and approximately million western resources common shares 
our embedded cost of long term debt was at december   a drop of from december  cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operations declined million from primarily due to income taxes paid on the gain on the sale of tyco stock 
individual items of working capital will vary with our normal business cycles and operations  including the timing of receipts and payments 
amortization of goodwill and subscriber accounts associated with the security alarm monitoring business increased  because security alarm monitoring operations were small during cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities varies with the timing of capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments 
for  we had positive net cash flow from investing activities because of the receipt of approximately billion in proceeds on the sale of tyco common stock 
we had two significant investing activities during which partially offset the proceeds from the sale of the tyco common stock 
we invested million to acquire security alarm monitoring companies and accounts 
we also invested approximately million in international power projects in the people s republic of china  the republic of turkey and colombia 
cash flows from financing activities we paid off million borrowed under a multi year revolving credit agreement with short term debt in the first quarter of in august  we issued million in convertible first mortgage bonds 
we used the proceeds  after expenses  to reduce short term debt 
in november  we converted the first mortgage bonds into unsecured senior notes having the same principal amount  interest rate and maturity date as the first mortgage bonds 
this conversion satisfied mortgage requirements to retire bonds in order to release our natural gas properties from the mortgage and contribute them to oneok see note 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of tyco common stock to reduce short term debt 
in aggregate  our short term debt has declined from million at december   to million at december  capital structure our capital structures at december   and were as follows common stock preferred and preference stock western resources obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely company subordinated debentures long term debt total security ratings standard poor s ratings group s p  fitch investors service fitch and moody s investors service moody s are independent credit rating agencies 
these agencies rate our preferred equity and debt securities 
these ratings indicate the agencies assessment of our ability to pay interest  dividends and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much we will have to pay as interest or dividends on securities we sell to obtain additional capital 
the better the rating  the less we will have to pay on preferred equity and debt securities we sell 
at december   ratings with these agencies were as follows kansas gas western western and electric resources resources company s mortgage short term mortgage bond debt bond rating agency rating rating rating s p a a bbb fitch a f a moody s a p a future cash requirements we believe that internally generated funds and new and existing credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements  debt service and dividend payments through the year uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these requirements with internally generated funds include the effect of competition and inflation on operating expenses  sales volume  regulatory actions  compliance with future environmental regulations  the availability of generating units and weather 
we believe that we will meet the needs of our electric utility customers without adding any major generation facilities in the next five years 
our business requires a significant capital investment 
we currently expect that through the year  we will need cash mostly for ongoing utility construction and maintenance program designed to maintain and improve facilities providing electric service growth within the security alarm monitoring business  including acquisition of subscriber accounts investment opportunities in international power development projects and generation facilities expansion of our nonregulated operations capital expenditures for and anticipated capital expenditures for through are as follows security alarm electric monitoring international other total dollars in thousands capital expenditures in included an additional million in improvements to our natural gas system 
because we contributed our natural gas business net assets to oneok  we will not incur any direct capital expenditures related to that business in future years 
electric capital expenditures include the cost of nuclear fuel 
security alarm monitoring capital expenditures include anticipated acquisitions of subscriber accounts 
international expenditures include commitments to international power development projects and generation facilities 
other primarily represents our commitments to our affordable housing tax credit program ahtc 
see discussion in other information below 
these estimates are prepared for planning purposes and may be revised see note 
electric expenditures will be significantly more than shown in the table above if we complete the merger with kcpl see note 
bond maturities and preference stock sinking fund requirements will require cash of approximately million through the year protection one is required to retire long term debt of approximately million through our currently authorized quarterly dividend of cents per common share or on an annual basis is paid from our earnings 
the payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors 
each quarter  the board makes a determination on the amount of dividends to declare  considering such matters as future earnings expectations and our financial condition 
other information competition and enhanced business opportunities the united states electric utility industry is evolving from a regulated monopolistic market to a competitive marketplace 
the energy policy act began deregulating the electricity industry 
the energy policy act permitted the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to order electric utilities to allow third parties the use of their transmission systems to sell electric power to wholesale customers 
a wholesale sale is defined as a utility selling electricity to a middleman  usually a city or its utility company  to resell to the ultimate retail customer 
as part of the kge merger  we agreed to open access of our transmission system for wholesale transactions 
ferc also requires us to provide transmission services to others under terms comparable to those we provide to ourselves 
during  wholesale electric revenues represented approximately of total electric revenues 
various states have taken steps to allow retail customers to purchase electric power from providers other than their local utility company 
the kansas legislature has created a retail wheeling task force the task force to study the effects of a deregulated and competitive market for electric services 
legislators  regulators  consumer advocates and representatives from the electric industry make up the task force 
the task force submitted a bill to the kansas legislature without recommendation 
this bill seeks competitive retail electric service on july  the bill was introduced to the kansas legislature in the opening days of the legislative session  but is not expected to come to a vote this year 
the task force also is evaluating how to recover certain investments in generation and related facilities which were approved and incurred under the existing regulatory model 
some of these investments may not be recoverable in a competitive marketplace 
we have opposed the task force s bill for this reason 
these unrecovered investments are commonly called stranded costs 
see stranded costs below for further discussion 
until a bill is passed by the kansas legislature  we cannot predict its impact on our company  but the impact could be material 
we believe successful providers of energy in a deregulated market will provide energy related services 
we believe consumers will demand innovative options and insist on efficient products and services to meet their energy related needs 
we believe that our strong core utility business provides a platform to offer the efficient energy products and services that customers will desire 
we continue to seek new ways to add value to the lives and businesses of our customers 
we recognize that our current customer base must expand beyond our existing service area 
we view every person in the united states and abroad as a potential customer 
increased competition for retail electricity sales may reduce future electric utility earnings compared to our historical electric utility earnings 
after all electric rate decreases are implemented  our rates will range from to of the national average for retail customers 
because of these reduced rates  we expect to retain a substantial part of our current sales volume in a competitive environment 
finally  we believe the deregulated energy market may prove beneficial to us 
we also plan to compensate for competitive pressure in our current regulated business with the nationwide security alarm monitoring services we offer to customers 
while operating in this competitive environment may place pressure on our profit margins  common dividends and credit ratings  we expect it to create opportunities 
wholesale and industrial customers may pursue cogeneration  self generation  retail wheeling  municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to cut their energy costs 
credit rating agencies are applying more stringent guidelines when rating utility companies due to increasing competition 
we offer competitive electric rates for industrial improvement projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain and increase electric load 
in light of competitive developments  we are pursuing the following strategic plan maintain a strong core energy business build a national branded presence create value through energy related investments to better position ourselves for the competitive energy environment  we have consummated a strategic alliance with oneok see note  have acquired a controlling interest in protection one see note and continue to develop international power projects 
stranded costs the definition of stranded costs for a utility business is the investment in and carrying costs on property  plant and equipment and other regulatory assets which exceed the amount that can be recovered in a competitive market 
we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and record regulatory assets and liabilities related to our generation  transmission and distribution operations 
if we determine that we no longer meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  we may have a material extraordinary non cash charge to operations 
reasons for discontinuing sfas accounting treatment include increasing competition that restricts our ability to charge prices needed to recover costs already incurred and a significant change by regulators from a cost based rate regulation to another form of rate regulation 
we periodically review sfas criteria and believe our net regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
if we discontinue sfas accounting treatment based upon competitive or other events  we may significantly impact the value of our net regulatory assets and our utility plant investments  particularly the wolf creek facility 
see competition and enhanced business opportunities above for initiatives taken to restructure the electric industry in kansas 
regulatory changes  including competition  could adversely impact our ability to recover our investment in these assets 
as of december   we have recorded regulatory assets which are currently subject to recovery in future rates of approximately million 
of this amount  million is a receivable for income tax benefits previously passed on to customers 
the remainder of the regulatory assets are items that may give rise to stranded costs including coal contract settlement costs  deferred employee benefit costs  deferred plant costs and debt issuance costs 
in a competitive environment  we may not be able to fully recover our entire investment in wolf creek 
we presently own of wolf creek 
our ownership would increase to if the kcpl merger is completed 
we also may have stranded costs from an inability to recover our environmental remediation costs and long term fuel contract costs in a competitive environment 
if we determine that we have stranded costs and we cannot recover our investment in these assets  our future net utility income will be lower than our historical net utility income has been unless we compensate for the loss of such income with other measures 
year issue we are currently addressing the effect of the year issue on our reporting systems and operations 
we face the year issue because many computer systems and applications abbreviate dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year  assuming that these two digits are always 
on january   some computer programs may incorrectly recognize the date as january  some computer systems may incorrectly process critical financial and operational information  or stop processing altogether because of the date abbreviation 
calculations using the year will affect computer applications before january  we have recognized the potential adverse effects the year issue could have on our company 
in  we established a formal year remediation program to investigate and correct these problems in the main computer systems of our company 
in  we expanded the program to include all business units and departments of our company 
the goal of our program is to identify and assess every critical system potentially affected by the year date change and to repair or replace those systems found to be incompatible with year dates 
we plan to have our year readiness efforts substantially completed by the end of we expect no significant operational impact on our ability to serve our customers  pay suppliers  or operate other areas of our business 
we currently estimate that total costs to update all of our systems for year compliance will be approximately million 
in  we expensed approximately million of these costs and based on what we now know  we expect to incur about million in to complete our efforts 
affordable housing tax credit program we have received authorization from the kcc to invest up to million in ahtc investments 
an example of an ahtc project is housing for residents who are elderly or meet certain income requirements 
at december   the company had invested approximately million to purchase limited partnership interests 
we are committed to investing approximately million more in ahtc investments by january  these investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
based upon an order received from the kcc  income generated from the ahtc investments  primarily tax credits  will be used to offset costs associated with postretirement and postemployment benefits offered to our employees 
tax credits are recognized in the year generated 
decommissioning decommissioning is a nuclear industry term for the permanent shut down of a nuclear power plant when the plant s license expires 
the nuclear regulatory commission nrc will terminate a plant s license and release the property for unrestricted use when a company has reduced the residual radioactivity of a nuclear plant to a level mandated by the nrc 
the nrc requires companies with nuclear power plants to prepare formal financial plans 
these plans ensure that funds required for decommissioning will be accumulated during the estimated remaining life of the related nuclear power plant 
the sec staff has questioned the way electric utilities recognize  measure and classify decommissioning costs for nuclear electric generating stations in their financial statements 
in response to the sec s questions  the financial accounting standards board is reviewing the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
if current accounting practices for nuclear power plant decommissioning are changed  the following could occur our annual decommissioning expense could be higher than in the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation the increased costs could be recorded as additional investment in the wolf creek plant we do not believe that such changes  if required  would adversely affect our operating results due to our current ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates
