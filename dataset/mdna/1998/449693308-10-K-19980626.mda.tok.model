item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed below are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties set forth below in this section under the sub heading factors affecting future results 
results of operations revenues in fiscal declined to million  from million in fiscal revenues in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decline in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower than expected orders from one customer after the company had structured its business to concentrate on this customer and a general decline in foundry business due to excess supply relative to demand experienced by several customers 
the fiscal to fiscal decline was driven mainly by reduced demand for standard products for secondary storage applications and lower average selling prices for foundry products 
foundry product sales accounted for of sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the company is attempting to shift from foundry product sales to sales of the company s standard products 
in sales of standard products were lower than anticipated due to a reduction in revenue from one particular customer 
the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will be flat with fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal specifically included in cost of revenues for fiscal are provisions of million for gate array inventories related to the company s decision to discontinue the gate array product and million for specific inventories associated with customer order cancellations and an overall decline in customer demand 
the increase in fiscal over was primarily due to less than optimum utilization of the company s wafer manufacturing capacity  due to the adverse business environment discussed earlier and the company s exit from the gate array business 
research and development expense in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to the discontinuance of development on secondary storage products  and epactm products 
this was offset by charges of  related to license fees for r d product development 
research and development spending is expected to increase reflecting the company s thrust in the area of power management products 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decline in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  is primarily due to lower accounts receivable write offs compared to the prior year  and lower spending due to reduced sales activity 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s operating results were affected by a decline in product demand and a downturn in the market 
in response to the downturn  the company made the decision to implement a restructuring plan which involved discontinuing the gate array product line  downsizing the workforce and closing a recently acquired new product design center 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal the charge comprises employee termination costs of  associated with reductions in the workforce  a design center equipment write off of  due to management s decision to close one of the company s design center facilities  and  associated with wafer cancellation costs and the write off of gate array capital equipment no longer usable 
net interest expense in fiscal was approximately  million compared to million in fiscal and  million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on capitalized leases 
however  the increase in fiscal from was due to increases in leased equipment 
the company had a net loss of million in fiscal  or per share  compared to a loss of million in fiscal or per share  and million profit in fiscal  or per diluted share 
the fiscal net loss was primarily attributable to low factory utilization 
the company has taken steps to address the year issues 
the products that the company sells do not have the year issue associated with them 
however  the hardware and software used in the design and production of these products are impacted by the year issue 
to that affect  the company has contacted all vendors and is continuing to work with them to resolve any problems that may occur 
we have assurances from some of them that they will have solutions at the later part of the year  others anticipate that they will have assurances some time next year 
this matter is not within the control of the company 
however  our vendors are large computer manufacturers  capital equipment manufacturers and software producers 
they do sell large quantities to our industry and we rely on their representation 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at march  from million at march   and million at march  the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to investment in certain product technology licensing rights  investment in capital equipment  and operating losses 
the increase in cash from to was mainly due to financing of capital equipment 
cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal to fiscal decrease in cash was very modest  due to spending control measures 
the fiscal to fiscal decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was due primarily to the net loss of million and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease of million in accounts receivable due to a decrease in sales  a decrease of million in inventories due to management efforts to reduce inventory to be more in line with current sales levels and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the fiscal to fiscal increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was due primarily to the fiscal net profit of approximately million and increases in accrued payroll  related expenses and current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash used for investing activities was approximately  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  reflecting cash invested in property and equipment acquisitions 
management expects capital additions for fiscal to remain flat or below fiscal capital additions 
cash used for financing activities was approximately million 
the company made payments on capital lease obligations and note payable in the amount of million 
this is offset by proceeds from stock sale of  in fiscal the company paid million on notes and capital lease obligations offset by million in equipment financing and million of stock option exercises 
in fiscal the company paid million in notes and capital lease obligations offset by proceed from stock option exercises of million 
at march   the company had a line of credit agreement with a bank which provides through october   for borrowings up to the lesser of million or up to of eligible accounts receivable 
at march   no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit 
borrowings under this line of credit accrue interest at the bank s reference rate plus resulting in an interest rate of at march  and are collateralized by all of the assets of the company 
under the agreement  the company is restricted from paying dividends and is required to maintain certain financial ratios among other restrictive covenants 
at march   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under this financing agreement due to the decline in the company s operating results  for which it obtained a waiver from the bank 
the company intends to replace this line of credit with a new agreement but there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so upon acceptable terms 
management believes that existing sources of liquidity  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facilities will be adequate to satisfy its anticipated working capital and capital equipment requirements through factors affecting future results the company s business  financial condition and results of operations have been  and may in the future  be affected by a variety of factors  including markets for its products and those of its customers  foundry utilization  concentration of customers  its ability to retain trained design and process engineers  the development and introduction of new technology and products and the availability of raw materials 
the fulfillment arrangements for standard analog products generally provide that orders may be terminated at will by either party and the customer is not required to commit to purchase a specific number of products  although cancellation or rescheduling charges may be imposed in certain circumstances 
the unanticipated loss of any of its major customers or the unanticipated cancellation or rescheduling of orders by any of them could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  particularly if the company s efforts with other customers do not result in the volume of manufacturing orders anticipated by the company 
the iomega programs that accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  were completed in fiscal no further revenues are expected from these programs in the future 
in addition  the current business climate has and will continue to result in less than optimum utilization of the company s manufacturing facilities  which will adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company made two significant reductions in workforce during fiscal that primarily affected manufacturing employees 
in fiscal the labor count was constant 
the ability of the company to transition from the fabrication of lower margin products to higher margin products  including both those developed by the company and those for which it serves as a third party foundry  is very important for the company s future results of operations 
rapidly changing customer demands may result in the obsolescence of existing company inventories 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts to keep pace with changing customer demands 
in this regard  the ability of the company to develop higher margin products will be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to retain its engineering personnel due to the company s current business climate 
although the company believes it currently has adequate access to necessary raw materials  it does not have any long term commitments for the supply of raw wafers and polysubstrates
