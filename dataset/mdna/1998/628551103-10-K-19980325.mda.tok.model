also  the company has available an uncommitted million operating line of credit with which it may choose to fund temporary operating cash needs 
during  the company capitalized million of internal software development costs principally related to the development of its s client server property and casualty software including the incorporation of object oriented technology and support for microsoft windows nt and cyberlife object oriented client server life insurance software  as well as other ongoing projects in support of its domestic and international product strategies 
significant expenditures planned for  excluding any possible business acquisitions and stock repurchases  are as follows acquisition of data processing and communications equipment  support software  buildings  building improvements and office furniture  fixtures and equipment and costs relating to the internal development of software systems 
the company has historically used the cash generated from operations for the development and acquisition of new products  acquisition of businesses and repurchase of the company s stock 
the company anticipates that  subject to market conditions  it will continue to use its cash for all of these purposes in the future and that projected cash from operations will be able to meet presently anticipated needs  however  the company may also consider incurring debt  as discussed above  as needed to accomplish specific objectives in these areas and for other general corporate purposes 
factors that may affect future results the company s operating results and financial condition may be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from current and historical results or the company s anticipated future results 
currently  the company s business is focused principally within the global property and casualty and life insurance and financial solutions industries 
significant changes in the regulatory or market environment of these industries could impact demand for the company s software products and services 
additionally  there is increasing competition for the company s products and services  and there can be no assurance that the company s current products and services will remain competitive  or that the company s development efforts will produce products with the cost and performance characteristics necessary to remain competitive 
furthermore  the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
the company s success will depend on the level of market acceptance of the company s products  technologies and enhancements  and its ability to introduce such products  technologies and enhancements to the market on a timely and cost effective basis  and maintain a labor force sufficiently skilled to compete in the current environment 
contracts with governmental agencies involve a variety of special risks  including the risk of early contract termination by the governmental agency and changes associated with newly elected state administrations or newly appointed regulators 
the timing and amount of the company s revenues are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of customers decisions to enter into large license agreements with the company  which make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter or year extremely uncertain 
additionally  while management believes that the company s financing needs for the foreseeable future will be satisfied from cash flows from operations and the company s currently existing credit facility  unforeseen events or adverse economic or business trends may significantly increase cash demands beyond those currently anticipated or affect the company s ability to generate raise cash to satisfy financing needs 
a significant portion of both the company s revenue and its operating income is derived from initial licensing charges received as part of the company s software licensing activities 
because a substantial portion of these revenues is recorded at the time new systems are licensed  there can be significant fluctuations from period to period in the revenues and operating income derived from licensing activities 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company  which the company is unable to control 
the company believes that current and potential customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company may be significantly affected by strategies to make their existing information systems capable of handling the year  however  at this time the company is unable to predict what the future impact  if any  will be 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
year readiness many existing computer programs were designed to use only two digits to identify a year in date fields 
if not corrected  these applications could fail or produce erroneous results when working with dates in the year and beyond 
this year issue may potentially affect the company in four areas its product offerings  its services offerings  third party products used internally  and its suppliers 
the company s various business units have been responsible for the assessment  remediation  validation and implementation of year corrective actions 
the application code of the company s primary product offerings  s  series ii  insure  point  cyberlife and cybertek ck products  were either initially designed or have been updated in their currently available releases to be capable of processing and storing date data with dates in both the twentieth s and twenty first s centuries 
the company is currently conducting an inventory and verifying the year readiness of the third party products with which these company applications are designed to operate in order to validate that no unanticipated year issues exist 
in addition  the company also is in the process of conducting an inventory and assessing other company and third party products previously licensed by the company to customers to determine if any renovation efforts may be required in relation to these products 
in its services offerings  the company has assessed and commenced year remediation of the applications used in processing the data of its information technology outsourcing ito and bpo services customers 
some of these remediation efforts are complete and some are still in various stages of coding  testing or implementation 
the company intends to complete these year remediation efforts and required testing  in a year test environment  prior to the need for these services to process data involving dates in the twenty first century 
the primary third party products used by the company for its internal operation include its data center hardware and software  internal financial systems  and network and pc hardware and software 
the company s blythewood data center has completed its hardware and operating software inventory assessments and has substantially completed the remediation efforts of updating these hardware and software assets for the year requirements 
the company s australian and european data centers also have completed their inventory assessment and are implementing the hardware and operating software enhancements required for year remediation 
in  the company commenced the process of identifying  selecting and implementing an enterprise wide financial and human resources system to replace its existing systems 
the selected solution is currently being implemented  is designed to meet year requirements  and is scheduled to be operational at the end of in addition  the company is commencing an inventory and assessing all of its network and pc hardware and software to determine if any year remediation upgrades will be required 
finally  the primary suppliers upon whom the company s services are dependent are electric utility and telephone companies who provide services to the company s various offices and data centers 
if these services are interrupted for a prolonged period due to the suppliers year problems  it will disrupt the company s ability to provide its services to customers  notwithstanding the backup battery and diesel power supplies available for the data center locations 
as discussed above  the company has not yet fully completed its year evaluations or its remediation efforts 
if such remediation efforts are not completed on a timely basis  year issues could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results 
however  based upon the company s experience to date  at this time  it is not anticipated that the completion of remaining year remediation efforts will have an adverse material effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
seasonality and inflation the company s operations have not proven to be significantly seasonal  though as with many companies in the software business  the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter annually 
quarterly revenues and net income can be expected to vary at times 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers entering into license agreements with the company 
the company is unable to control the timing of these decisions or fluctuations 
the company s domestic property and casualty segment has an outsourcing contract in florida 
in  the state of florida legislatively imposed six month homeowner policies as opposed to the normal twelve month policies 
this decision was reversed later that year  but now has a carryover effect  which may last for several years and places most policy renewal dates in the latter part of the year 
since a significant percentage of the company s revenue under this contract is derived from processing renewals  the carryover effect has caused a portion of the revenue to shift to the last half of the year 
although the company cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto  the company has been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
to the extent permitted by the marketplace for the company s products and services  the company attempts to recover increases in costs by periodically increasing prices 
additionally  most of the company s license agreements and long term services agreements provide for annual increases in charges 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of statements in this annual report that are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including economic  competitive and technological factors affecting the company s operations  markets  products  services and prices  as well as other specific factors discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and elsewhere herein and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated
