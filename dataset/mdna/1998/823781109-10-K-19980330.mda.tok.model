on november   the company announced a change in its strategic direction  which was to place more emphasis on its hospital based business and to reduce its emphasis on the primary care business  and its intent to dispose of non strategic office based physician practices 
due to this change in strategic direction  the company wrote down certain assets related to its office based operations to their estimated realizable values  and accrued certain liabilities for commitments that no longer have value to the company s future operations

the company generally provides all of the primary care services required under such arrangements  and refers its patients to unaffiliated specialist physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers which deliver the remainder of the required health care services 
the company s profitability under such arrangements is dependent upon its ability to effectively manage the use of specialist physician  hospital and other health care services by its patients 
in order to effectively manage the company s growth generated by the acquisition of physician practices the company made significant investments in personnel  computer equipment  computer software and other infrastructure costs 
these investments resulted in significant increases in salaries and benefits  general and administrative expenses  and capital expenditures during and  compared to prior years 
as a result of the acquisition and several transactions with physician practices completed by the company and its predecessor  goodwill constitutes a substantial percentage of the total assets of the company  and the company s results of operations include substantial expenses for goodwill amortization 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets of those acquired businesses which net assets include any separately identifiable intangible assets 
as of december   the company s total assets were approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was goodwill 
of the total goodwill at december   million is related to the acquisition  and million is related to several acquisitions of physician practices completed by the predecessor and the company 
the goodwill related to the acquisition represents the going concern value of the company  which consists of the company s market position and reputation  its relationships with its customers and affiliated physicians  the relationships between its affiliated physicians and their patients  and other similar intangible assets 
since these assets are believed by the company to have useful lives of an indefinite length  and the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would limit the useful lives of these assets  this goodwill is being amortized over years 
the company also acquired other intangible assets as part of the acquisition  including the value of the company s physician employee workforce  management team  non physician employee workforce and computer software 
these intangible assets have been capitalized separately from goodwill and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from five to seven years 
the goodwill related to the acquisitions of physician practices also represents the going concern value of those practices 
however  since the going concern value of an individual physician practice  or a small group of practices  is subject to a higher degree of risk than the company as a whole and may be more adversely affected by changes in the health care industry  this goodwill is being amortized over shorter periods ranging from to years 
the goodwill related to the acquisition of options to acquire physician practices and the simultaneous execution of management agreements with the practices represents the going concern value of those management agreements 
this goodwill is being amortized over the terms of the management agreements which range from to years 
the company continuously evaluates all components of goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether there has been any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or such other intangible assets or their useful lives 
the company is not aware of any such impairment at the current time  except for the impairment included in the million write down of office based net assets in discussed above  which resulted primarily from the company s change in strategic direction
