net interest income net interest income consists primarily of the difference between the rate earned on contracts held on the balance sheet prior to securitization and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings to finance the warehousing of such contracts 
the following table illustrates the average rate earned on contracts  the average rate paid on borrowings and the corresponding net interest rate spread 
net interest rate spread for the years ended december  yield on contracts cost of borrowings net interest rate spread the yield on contracts is net of dealer participation amortized expenses 
gain on sale of contracts the company computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as retained interest in securitized assets risa on the balance sheet and is amortized against servicing income over the life of the contracts 
the gain recorded in the income statement is adjusted for prepaid dealer commissions  issuance costs and the effect of hedging activities 
the company recorded gains on sale of contracts of million on the sale of million of contracts in for its securitizations

servicing fee income contractual servicing is earned at a rate of per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized and is consistent with industry standards 
excess servicing income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold and the performance of the contracts

results of operations years ended december   and the company had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million and a net loss of million for the years ended december  and the reduction in net income from to was attributable to several factors  most notably to the company s commitment to build reserves in the face of increasing delinquency and credit loss ratios related to purchases of contracts in the second half of and the first half of by one of the company s auto finance centers 
management believes that the company is adequately reserved at this time 
additionally  the losses incurred by the company during its start up phase calendar years and generated net operating loss carryforwards which were fully utilized in to shield pretax income 
the unavailability of these carryforwards in accounted for a significant portion of the net income differential between and net interest income 
net interest income increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  the increase is due in part to higher net interest margins available to the company throughout as compared to and to an increase in the average amount of contracts held for sale during as compared to net interest margins rose to in from in while the average amount of contracts held for sale increased to million in from million in the yield on contracts held for sale increased by 
to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  in addition  the company s cost of borrowings decreased by 
from at december  to at december  servicing fee income 
servicing fee income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a significant increase in the size of the average servicing portfolio

provision for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held on balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held on balance sheet or by the reduction of contracts held on balance sheet 
the level of the allowance is determined based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on balance sheet  pending sales of contracts and historical loss trends 
when the company sells contracts in a securitization transaction  it reduces its allowance for credit losses and factors potential losses into its calculations of gain on sale 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the owned portfolio 
salaries and benefits expense 
the company incurred salary and benefit expenses of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in order to support the growth of its operations and the servicing portfolio  the company hired employees during the number of employees increased from at december  to at december  to at december  other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  and from million for the year ended december  the majority of increases were due to the growth of the average servicing portfolio from million to million and million at december   and  respectively 
additionally  the company opened additional auto finance centers during the years ended december  and december  income taxes 
the company files federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group that includes onyx and oafc

management  in response to increases in delinquency and charge off ratios relating to the purchase of contracts by one of the company s auto finance centers see financial condition asset quality increased the estimate of future losses used to compute the gain on sale of loans during this change  along with the additional reserves set aside for these loans increased the reserve for serviced assets from at december  to at december  financial condition contracts held for sale contracts held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the number and principal balance of contracts held for sale is largely dependent upon the timing and size of the company s securitizations 
the increase in the contracts held for sale from year end to year end is primarily attributable to the company s higher contract volume during the december warehousing period and to the sale of contracts originated during the december warehousing period into the fourth quarter securitization transaction  which was a prefunded sale 
onyx securitizes contracts on a regular basis 
see notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for contracts held for sale and allowance for credit losses 
trust receivable at the time a securitization closes  the company is required to establish spread accounts in connection with each securitization 
depending on the securitization structure  the company may be required to deposit cash into the spread account 
the future servicing cash flows generated by contracts sold to each trust are deposited into the related spread account and are expected to be paid to the company after the related spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
trust receivable represents funds due to the company but not yet disbursed from the spread accounts  because of the restrictions imposed by the terms of the securitizations 
trust receivable at december  was million compared to million at december   an increase of  a result of the increase in total contracts securitized and outstanding 
retained interest in securitized assets risa consists of the estimated present value of future servicing cash flows from related securitizations 
future servicing cash flows are computed by taking into account certain assumptions principally regarding prepayments  losses and servicing costs 
these cash flows are then discounted at a market based rate 
the balance is then amortized against actual servicing fee income on a monthly basis

at december   delinquencies for the servicing portfolio represented of the amount of contracts in its servicing portfolio compared to at december  net charge offs as a percentage of the average servicing portfolio were for the period ended december  compared to for the period ended december  the levels of delinquencies and loan losses have increased and the management of onyx believes that this increase is attributable in part to an increase on a national basis in the level of bankruptcies and consumer defaults generally  and the tendency of delinquencies and losses with respect to a pool of automobile loans to increase after a period of seasoning 
the delinquency and loss levels of the servicing portfolio were also affected by the continued impact of high delinquency and loss levels of the contracts purchased through the third quarter of by the company s north hollywood auto finance center 
the north hollywood auto finance center had a higher concentration of used car dealerships than the company s other auto finance centers  and this concentration of used car dealerships was principally responsible for the deterioration in the performance of the portion of onyx s portfolio that was purchased from july to september the performance of these loans has impacted delinquency and losses through december  and has contributed a disproportionate amount of the delinquencies and losses for that period 
management has also increased its on and off balance sheet reserves of the serviced portfolio from at december  to at december  off balance sheet reserves are those reserves established within the separate financial statements of the grantor trusts in connection with securitized contracts

liquidity and capital resources the company requires substantial cash and capital resources to operate its business 
its primary uses of cash include i acquisition of contracts  ii payment of dealer participation  iii securitization costs  including cash held in spread accounts  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v maintenance of working capital requirements and payment of operating expenses  and vi interest expense 
the capital resources available to the company include i net interest income during the warehousing period  ii contractual servicing fees  iii future servicing cash flows  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v sales of contracts in securitizations  and vi borrowings under its credit facilities 
these sources can provide capital to fund expansion of the company s contract purchasing and servicing capabilities 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided in the year ended december  and million used in the principal reason for the increase in cash used in the company s operating activities was the increase in contracts purchased during the year 
this increase was partially offset by the proceeds from securitizations in contract volume increased to million in compared to million in  an increase of 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in the year ended december  from  and  in the years ended december  and respectively 
this increase resulted from higher capital expenditures by the company  principally in the purchase of furniture and equipment  in connection with the company s expansion 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used and million provided for the years ended december  and this increase over was primarily due to an increase in borrowing from the company s warehouse and revolving credit facilities  which are discussed below 
the company s wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  oafc  is party to a million auto loan warehouse program the cp facility with triple a one funding corporation triple a 
triple a is a commercial paper asset backed conduit lender sponsored by mbia and is currently rated a p by standard poor s ratings group and moody s investor services  inc  respectively such ratings are not recommendations to invest and are subject to change 
this facility provides funds to purchase contracts 
the advance rate to oafc has been recently increased to from of adjusted eligible principal balance of each contract 
the advance rate is subject to reduction by mbia if the net yield on oafc s contract portfolio falls below a target net yield 
the remaining of the purchase price of the contracts generally is funded either from net interest income earned by oafc or by proceeds from the revolving facility described below 
since the cp facility is commercial paper based  the company has the ability to manage its interest rate exposure during the warehouse period between origination and securitization by determining the maturities one to days of its commercial paper borrowings 
upon the occurrence of a wind down event as defined in the cp facility documents  no further borrowings by oafc from triple a will be permitted and all collections on the contracts included in the borrowing base are distributed in substantially the same manner as before the wind down event except that all outstanding triple a advances must be repaid before any amounts can be paid to other borrowers or oafc 
unless earlier terminated upon the occurrence of a wind down event  the cp facility matures in september  subject to the requirement that the liquidity facility provided by certain banks to triple a be extended annually 
after maturity in september  the cp facility is subject to annual renewals upon mutual consent of the parties 
additionally  the company has a collateralized revolving line of credit with an institutional lender the revolving facility 
this facility has recently been increased from million to million 
the revolving facility is used for working capital and other expenditures for which the company s million cp facility is not otherwise available 
under the revolving facility  onyx may subject to borrowing base availability borrow and repay during the two year revolving period up to million based on the following collateral based formula up to the lesser of of the net book value of the company s risa and trust receivables for the securitizations deemed eligible by the lenders or of the value of such risa and trust receivables determined by such lenders in accordance with their collateral valuation model 
advances bear interest at over the lenders prime rate 
the company s obligations under the revolving facility are collateralized by a blanket lien on the company s assets 
the revolving facility contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants and other provisions typical of such credit facilities 
the revolving facility converts from revolving loans to fully amortizing two year term loans on january  or  if earlier  upon the occurrence of certain credit triggers 
in an effort to expand and diversify lending relationships  the company created a new special finance subsidiary onyx acceptance funding corporation ofc during the first quarter of since then  ofc has developed two lending lines with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc the million line the merrill line provides funding for the expansion of the purchase or origination of contracts and is used in concert with the cp facility the company currently has in place 
the merrill line provides an advance rate of approximately of the principal balance of each of the contracts that are used as collateral for the financing 
the interest rate is based on libor 
the merrill line has a term of one year and matures in february of the million line the residual facility is a residual financing line and can be used by the company to finance any operating requirements 
the amount available for borrowings is based on a collateral based formula of a percentage of the value of excess cash flow to be received from certain securitizations 
the interest rate is based on libor 
the residual facility has a term of one year and matures in february of the facilities contain affirmative  negative and financial covenants typical of the such credit facilities 
the company  during the first quarter of  completed a million subordinated debt offering 
the term of the subordinated debt is for two years ending february  with an option by the company to extend the term by three years during which the loan would fully amortize  and bears a fixed interest rate at 
the company also issued to the lender a warrant for common stock in the amount of  shares of the common stock of the company 
securitizations the company has a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of its contracts to investors through the issuance of aaa aaa rated  asset backed securities 
management s experience in this area dates back to the company believes that experience coupled with the quality of contracts acquired and the company s management information systems are instrumental in the company successfully completing ten aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten securitizations since october the company successfully completed four aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten securitizations in totaling million compared to four securitizations in totaling million 
in the first quarter of  the company sold whole loans  with servicing retained  in the amount of million and securitized contracts in the amount of million 
these ongoing periodic securitizations are an integral part of the company s business plan because they allow the company to increase its liquidity  provide for redeployment of its capital and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the net proceeds of these securitizations are generally used to pay down outstanding loans under the company s cp facility  thereby creating availability for the acquisition of additional contracts 
in each of its securitizations  the company sells its contracts from oafc to a newly formed grantor trust 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing certificates to investors in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
purchasers of the certificates backed by contracts receive a fixed rate of interest established at the time of the sale 
interest rate exposure and hedging the company is able through the use of varying maturities on advances from the cp facility to lock in rates during the warehousing period  when in management s judgment it is appropriate  to limit interest rate exposure during the warehousing period 
see risk factors interest rate risk 
the company has the ability to move rates upward in response to rising borrowing costs because the company currently does not originate loans near the maximum rates permitted by law 
further  the company employs a hedging strategy which primarily consists of the execution of forward interest rate swaps 
these hedges are entered into by the company in numbers and amounts which generally correspond to the anticipated principal amount of the related securitization 
gains and losses relative to these hedges are recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain on sale of the contracts 
the company has only used counterparties with investment grade debt ratings from national rating agencies for its hedging transactions 
management monitors the company s hedging activities on a frequent basis to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the company s hedging strategy requires estimates by management of monthly contract acquisition volume and timing of its securitizations 
if such estimates are materially inaccurate  then the company s gain on sales of contracts and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management based upon the amount of contracts purchased and the interest rate environment 
senior management currently expects to hedge substantially all of its contracts pending securitization
