item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general summary the company is an international cro providing a broad range of integrated drug development services primarily to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
this broad portfolio of drug development services includes transgenic discovery research  preclinical development and clinical capabilities that enable the company to manage a comprehensive drug development program or a client s specific requirements 
the company utilizes its international expertise and experience in preclinical and clinical services to provide a coordinated approach for a client to transition its drug through various preclinical to clinical stages of development thereby minimizing certain delays which typically occur before a new drug is introduced to the market 
in addition  the company is the only cro that is currently able to use its proprietary transgenic and licensed gene targeting technology to provide services for its clients that require transgenic animal models in order to determine the function of human genes and identify therapeutic targets implicated in disease and for the evaluation of therapeutic lead compounds for further development 
the company generates substantially all of its revenues from its drug development services and provides services for more than clients in countries 
on march   the company issued a million subordinated debenture to a wholly owned subsidiary of mds 
as part of this transaction  the company also issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock for per share 
in addition  the company and mds entered into a standstill agreement which  among other things  governs the ownership and acquisition of securities of the company by mds and its affiliates 
as a part of this transaction  mds and the company will explore opportunities to pursue strategic alliances and other business opportunities with respect to their respective operations 
on december   the company issued  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition by the company of all of the outstanding capital stock of  or equity interests in  bioclin  inc  a delaware corporation  bioclin europe ag  a swiss corporation  bioclin gmbh  a german corporation  kilmer nv  a netherlands antilles corporation  and bioclin institute of clinical pharmacology gmbh  a german corporation 
the acquisition was recorded using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition  the company incurred business combination costs aggregating approximately million 
chrysalis is also the exclusive commercial licensee of a us patent covering dna microinjection  the process widely used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to develop transgenic animals 
the company utilizes this license for its drug development services and grants sublicenses for the use of this technology 
these sublicenses entitle the company to receive revenues consisting of fees and  in certain cases  royalties 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between non us currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of us revenues and operating results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were from operations outside the us approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  were from operations in france and denominated in french francs  accordingly  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the french franc and the us dollar may have a material effect on the company s operating results 
see liquidity and capital requirements exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  the company may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s multi country contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the company incurs the expenses related to such contracts 
for such multi country contracts  the company seeks to require its client to incur the effect of fluctuations in the relative values of the contract currency and the currency in which the expenses are incurred 
to the extent the company is unable to require its clients to incur the effects of currency fluctuations  these fluctuations could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the company does not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s contracts are typically fixed price contracts that require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at or near the time the trial is initiated 
the company generally bills its clients upon the completion of negotiated performance requirements and  to a lesser extent  on a date certain basis 
certain of the company s contracts are subject to cost limitations which cannot be exceeded without client approval 
because  in many cases  the company bears the risk of cost overruns  unbudgeted costs in connection with performing these contracts may have a detrimental effect on the financial results of the company 
if it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which the determination is made 
the company s contracts generally may be terminated with or without cause 
in the event of termination  the company is typically entitled to all sums owed for work performed through the notice of termination and all costs associated with termination of the study 
in addition  most of the company s contracts provide for an early termination fee  the amount of which usually declines as the work progresses 
the company s service contracts also contain certain provisions designed to address the negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability as a result of non controllable delays 
these provisions  however  may not be included in all of the company s service contracts 
in any event  the company attempts to negotiate reimbursement of certain fees whether or not such provisions are included in the service contract 
the company is not always successful in negotiating such reimbursement 
the loss of or delay in a large contract or the loss of multiple contracts  however  could adversely affect the company s future revenues and profitability 
in addition  termination or delay in the performance of a contract occurs for various reasons  including  but not limited to  unexpected or undesired results  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested  adverse patient reactions to the drug being tested  or the client s decision to not proceed with a particular trial 
revenue for contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis as work is performed 
revenue is affected by the mix of trials conducted and the degree to which effort is expended 
the company will incur travel costs and may subcontract with third party investigators in connection with multi site clinical trials 
these costs are passed through to clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in service revenue 
the costs may vary significantly from contract to contract  therefore  changes in service revenue may not be indicative of trends in revenue growth 
accordingly  the company considers net service revenue  which consists of service revenue less these costs  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
the company has had  and will continue to have  certain clients from which at least of the company s overall revenue is generated over multiple contracts 
such concentration of business is not uncommon within the cro industry 
for the year ended december   the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of its combined net service revenue 
one customer  one of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies  accounted for approximately of the company s net service revenues in fiscal the company believes that the loss of any of these customers  if not replaced or if services provided to existing customers are not expanded  may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the loss of any such customer would be replaced or services to existing customers would be expanded on terms acceptable to the company 
the company has incurred expenses during expanding its infrastructure  primarily in the clinical operations  to support global drug development capabilities and utilizing management s resources primarily to communicate these expanded capabilities to its existing client base and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
as a result of these efforts  the company believes it is capable of supporting higher revenues 
however  the company s future operating results will be contingent upon successfully utilizing this expanded infrastructure which will require the company to convert proposals into contracts and revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully utilize its expanded infrastructure or that proposals will be converted into revenues in a timely manner 
the company s ability to utilize its expanded infrastructure in order to enhance future operating results may also be affected by factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant preclinical and clinical trials  the lengthening of lead times to convert proposals into contracts and revenues  and the termination of preclinical and clinical trials  all of which may be beyond the control of the company 
see quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of various factors  such as delays experienced in implementing or completing particular services and termination of services 
since a substantial portion of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed  while revenue is subject to fluctuations  minor variations or delays in the timing of services or the progress of services may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter 
the company s largest client  a leading pharmaceutical company  notified the company that it decided to change a clinical protocol and thereby delay a large clinical trial which was originally expected to begin during the fourth quarter of as a result  consistent with management s expectations  results during the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted 
as a result of this delay and the strategic decision to maintain clinical infrastructure utilized for this contract and to position chrysalis for growth opportunities  revenues and earnings in the first half of will be significantly affected 
the company has been informed that this client currently anticipates a decision on the commencement of this trial in the second quarter of fiscal on august   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into the joint venture agreement with holdings  a wholly owned subsidiary of baxter  which is a subsidiary of baxter international 
under the joint venture agreement  the company and holdings formed nextran  a delaware general partnership  in which the company had a partnership interest and holdings had a partnership interest 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  dated september   as amended  the company consummated the sale of its partnership interest in nextran to transplant acquisition inc  a wholly owned subsidiary baxter  for a cash purchase price of million 
as a result of these transactions  the company is no longer required to use its resources to fund the development of its organ transplantation or blood substitute programs 
historically  these programs have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s research and development expenses  capital expenditures  working capital and accumulated deficit 
prior to the sale of its partnership interest in nextran  the company recorded its share of nextran s financial results of operations in its consolidated financial statements according to the equity method of accounting 
results of operations revenues by business and geographic region revenues s preclinical    clinical    licensing other total    international    north america    licensing other total    fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were  for compared to  and  for and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its revenues from operations outside of the us excluding the impact of foreign currency translations  revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately  as compared to  for see liquidity and capital requirements exchange rate fluctuations 
this increase from to was primarily the result of the following i an increase in the clinical business including services provided under contracts with the company s largest customer  ii an increase in the company s specialty transgenic and molecular biology services  and iii an increase in preclinical business in europe 
these increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations as well as by a decrease in the preclinical business in north america  and the phase i clinical business in europe 
additionally  revenues in were negatively impacted by a delay in a large clinical trial which was originally expected to begin in the fourth quarter of the company believes that revenue growth for the clinical business for the year ended december  was also adversely affected as a result of i the long lead times in converting proposals into contracts and revenues and ii in the first half of  the continuing impact  as a result of such long lead times  of the focus of senior management in the clinical business in the negotiation and consummation of the acquisition during and  consequently  having less opportunity to devote to business development and marketing the clinical business

as a result of this delay and the strategic decision to maintain clinical infrastructure utilized for this contract and to position chrysalis for growth opportunities  revenues and earnings in the first half of will be significantly affected 
the company has been informed that this client currently anticipates a decision on the commencement of this trial in the second quarter of fiscal the increase in revenues from to was due to an increase in business activity for the preclinical drug development services in both the european and us marketplace 
this increase in preclinical services was offset by a decrease in revenues from clinical services 
the company believes the increase in preclinical business activity was a result of the improvement in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries outsourcing trends and expanded cash reserves within the biotechnology sector 
the decrease of approximately  in revenues for the clinical business was due to the decision in to discontinue providing services for phase i trials in the us which represented approximately  in revenues for the clinical business in in addition  revenues for the clinical business in were adversely affected by senior managements involvement in the negotiation and consummation of the acquisition and  consequently  having less opportunity than in to devote to business development and marketing the clinical business

excluding the impact of foreign currency translations  this increase in direct costs of  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  would have been approximately  this increase in direct costs was primarily due to i investment in personnel and infrastructure to support the long term business expansion strategy of the company and to accommodate the large clinical trial with a leading pharmaceutical company which was delayed in the last quarter of see general summary and ii increased variable costs as a result of increased business activity in the company s european preclinical services and specialty transgenic and molecular biology services in the increase in these costs as a percent of revenues is due to a base cost structure of personnel  facilities  and related expenses which is capable of supporting a higher level of revenues than experienced during the year ended december  this relationship of direct costs to revenues is expected to continue at least through the first half of  as the company will retain the majority of its recently expanded infrastructure to better position the company for long term growth 
although direct costs remained relatively unchanged on a company wide basis for as compared to  direct costs associated with preclinical business increased as a result of additional business activity  which resulted in an increase in variable costs such as materials and supplies  offset by a decrease in direct costs for the clinical business primarily due to the decision to discontinue providing services for phase i trials in the us research and development expenses in decreased to  from  in  which decreased from  in this decrease in research and development expenses over the past three years was primarily the result of the shift in the strategic focus of the company s transgenic animal services from the internal development of transgenic animal models to providing commercial specialty drug development services 
because research and development expenses have become immaterial primarily as a result of the shift in the strategic focus and the related decline in costs  research and development expenses shown for reporting purposes in prior periods will be reclassified in into direct costs 
general  administrative and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in  which increased from  in excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  this increase of  for the period ended december   as compared to the same period in  would have been approximately  this increase in expenses for was primarily due to i the increase in personnel and related costs for marketing and business development  information systems  general management and financial management activities  ii the increase in personnel and related costs associated with the management of the european clinical business  and iii the increase in personnel and facility costs associated with the increase in the company s specialty transgenic and molecular biology services 
the increase in these expenses from to was primarily the result of an increase in costs for expansion of operations in eastern europe  additional personnel for accounting  business development  administration and information systems  increased personnel related costs and increased sales  marketing and advertising expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased to  in from  in and  in business combination costs 
the company incurred costs in associated with the acquisition aggregating  these costs included expenses associated with the acquisition of the clinical business  the name change from dnx corporation to chrysalis and certain other related items 
as of december    of these costs remained to be paid and are classified as accrued expenses in the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k 
other income expense 
other income expense represented income of  in  compared to income of  for  and expense of  for this decrease from to was partially due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower outstanding debt balances see liquidity and capital requirements debt offset by a decrease in interest income earned in as a result of a decrease in cash and other investment balances 
also included in other income in was a  nonrecurring gain resulting from a settlement agreement with virginia commonwealth university  signed in the third quarter of the primary reasons for the improvement in other income expense in from were interest income of  earned as the result of higher cash balances primarily resulting from the sale of nextran in the third quarter of and a foreign currency gain of  primarily as a result of exchange rate fluctuations between the german mark and swiss franc associated with short term borrowings of the company s german operations denominated in swiss francs 
the company repaid this debt denominated in swiss francs in such income was offset primarily by interest expense of  on outstanding debt 
in  the company expects to report an increase in net interest expense as a result of the issuance of the subordinated debenture and the warrants in the transaction with mds 
equity in net loss of nextran 
as a result of its minority equity ownership in nextran  the company recorded its share of nextran s financial results in its consolidated financial statements based on the equity method of accounting 
as a result of the sale of its partnership interest in nextran  the company no longer records a share of nextran s financial results of operations in its consolidated financial statements subsequent to september  the company s share of nextran s loss amounted to  for the period ended september   as compared to  for the period from august  the date of formation of nextran through december  gain on sale of nextran

these tax credits have an unlimited carryforward period 
the company s acquisition of the clinical drug development business resulted in an ownership change under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
accordingly  the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to offset operating profits may be subject to certain limitations in the future under the code 
these net operating loss carryforwards may not be utilized to offset profit in other countries 
quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant preclinical and clinical trials  termination of preclinical and clinical trials  acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of studies or trials are often the result of actions taken by clients or regulatory authorities and are not typically subject to the control of the company 
since a large amount of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed while its revenues are subject to fluctuation  minor variations in the commencement  progress or completion of preclinical and clinical trials may cause significant variations in quarterly operating results

in connection with the acquisition on december   the company acquired approximately million of short term borrowings outstanding under line of credit arrangements with various banks 
the majority of such borrowings and credit arrangements were guaranteed by certain prior stockholders of the clinical business 
one of the conditions of the closing of the acquisition was the release of these guarantees 
in order to satisfy this condition  on december   the company paid approximately million to reduce these short term borrowings and transferred approximately million into escrow for purposes of securing the future payment of the remaining personally guaranteed borrowings

additionally  the favorable interest rate on the mortgage with the pennsylvania agency is subject to change upon review by the agency of certain future conditions 
capital requirements 
the company anticipates that its future capital requirements may include investment for expansion of its operating infrastructure to meet anticipated increased demand for drug development services from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in connection with the refinancing of the notes see debt  the company has quarterly cash requirements for the repayment of principal beginning september  and monthly cash requirements for interest payments due throughout the five year term of the loan  as well as a requirement to comply with certain restrictive debt covenants 
in addition  the company will have semi annual cash requirements beginning in for the payment of interest on the subordinated debenture issued in the mds transaction 
the company believes that with its current financial resources it has the ability to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company may  from time to time  consider funding its future capital requirements including retirement of or interest payments on current debt by issuing stock or other securities in public or private equity or debt financings 
in the event that the company seeks to issue stock or other securities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to issue such stock or other securities or that any financing will be available to the company or that such offering or financing will be available on acceptable terms 
in addition to the above  the company s working capital and other capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including among others success in increasing the company s revenues and managing its operations  maintaining its contractual relationship with its top customer  exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies  capital expenditures for clinical and preclinical information system objectives  the level of company resources devoted to management  marketing  information and data management capabilities and business and financial administration  technological advances  and the status of competitors  as well as the costs of potential future acquisitions  dispositions or strategic alliances described below

exchange rate fluctuations approximately  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively  were derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
translation adjustments are reported as a separate section of stockholders equity 
the company may be subject to foreign currency transaction risks when the company s multi country contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the company incurs the expenses related to such contracts 
for such multi country contracts  the company seeks to require its client to incur the effect of fluctuations in the relative values of the contract currency and the currency in which the expenses are incurred 
to the extent the company is unable to require its clients to incur the effects of currency fluctuations  these fluctuations could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the company generally does not hedge its currency translation and transaction exposure 
due to its preclinical operations in france  the percentage of the company s total revenues recorded in french francs is significant 
for the fiscal years  and  the french operations accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the french franc and the us dollar will affect the translation of the french preclinical operation s revenues and operating results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results  and also affect the us dollar amounts actually received by the company from the french preclinical operations 
based on the assumption that the french preclinical operations will continue to represent a significant portion of the business of the company  the appreciation of the us dollar against the french franc would have an unfavorable impact on the company s revenues and a favorable impact on the company s operating expenses due to the effect of such currency translation on the french preclinical operation s operating results  however  the depreciation of the us dollar against the french franc would have a favorable impact on the company s revenues and an unfavorable impact on the company s operating expenses 
the net effect of such impact can not be predicted with certainty 
for purposes of the company s consolidated financial results  the results of operations of the french preclinical business denominated in french francs have been translated from french francs into us dollars using the following exchange rates french franc us dollar per period per us dollar french franc the rates in the above table represent an average exchange rate calculated using rates quoted in the wall street journal 
as of march   the french franc per us dollar rate was 
accumulated deficit since its inception in until the formation in and subsequent sale of its partnership interest in nextran in  the company expended substantial funds for research and development and capital expenditures 
a significant portion of such expenditures were made to support the company s organ transplantation and blood substitute research and development programs  which programs were transferred to the nextran partnership 
historically  these expenditures accounted for a substantial portion of the company s accumulated deficit 
also contributing to the accumulated deficit are the costs associated with the development of a worldwide clinical business 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations 
year the company is currently taking steps to assess the year issue from an internal  supplier and customer perspective 
although the company believes at this time that neither the costs nor expenses of the year issue will be material to the company  the ultimate costs and expenses are currently unknown and such costs or the consequences of failure to correct any year issues could have a material impact on chrysalis financial conditions  business or operations
