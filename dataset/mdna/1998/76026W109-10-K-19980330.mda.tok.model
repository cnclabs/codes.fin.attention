this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general the company has grown rapidly through the implementation of its strategy of integrating value added distribution services with contract manufacturing 
since the acquisition of k byte manufacturing in  the company s net sales have increased from approximately million to approximately million in the company has also focused on improving its operating margin through such measures as i shifting reptron distribution s business mix from standard component sales to higher margin value added services  which now represent of its net sales  ii continuing to increase the number of customers using both of the company s distribution and contract manufacturing services  thereby lowering overall selling expenses  iii investing in facilities technology in order to improve efficiencies  and iv creating a corporate sales operation to more efficiently access smaller volume customers 
k byte manufacturing offers contract manufacturing services to its customers on a turnkey basis pursuant to customer designs 
in turnkey contracts  k byte manufacturing purchases the electronic components and other material used in assembly and charges for these items in addition to its labor and manufacturing costs 
for strategic reasons  k byte manufacturing does not pursue consignment business in which the customer supplies the product material and pays only for labor and manufacturing costs 
the company believes that by retaining total responsibility for material procurement it can achieve greater control of the manufacturing process and can leverage the strengths of reptron distribution 
the marketing cycle for k byte manufacturing engagements tends to span six to twelve months and the start up phase typically spans another six months 
during start up  significant investments are made by k byte manufacturing and its customers to prepare for the successful launch of the contract manufacturing engagement 
k byte manufacturing s contracts with customers address the customers obligations relative to cancellation  component price increases  engineering change notices  inventory stores  work in process and vendor stock and payment terms 
in  in order to expand reptron s geographic presence  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of cronin electronics  inc and the electronic components distribution business of western micro technology  inc collectively  the acquisitions 
the acquisitions  which were accounted for using the purchase method  involved a total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and the balance in assumed liabilities 
in december  the company also created a division devoted solely to selling memory modules 
this division sells memory modules primarily to computer integrators and value added resellers  a customer base not historically served by reptron distribution 
sales in this market segment are generally characterized by lower gross margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses than other sales generated by reptron distribution 
sales from this division have increased rapidly and accounted for and of reptron distribution s net sales in and  respectively and of the company s total net sales in and  respectively 
sales for reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing are recognized upon shipment  except for sales from in plant stores 
sales from in plant stores are recognized when a customer removes a product from the company s in plant inventory 
sales from in plant stores represented and of reptron distribution s and and of k byte manufacturing s and net sales  respectively and of the company s total net sales in and  respectively 
in plant inventories are tracked using bar code labeling technology or frequent inventory counts 
cost of sales for reptron distribution includes only the cost of materials electronic components 
cost of sales for k byte manufacturing includes the cost of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
certain and costs of goods sold and selling  general and administrative costs have been reclassified to correspond to the presentation 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reorganized many of its operations  including the decentralization of the following functions mis  accounting  payroll  credit and collections  engineering and human resources 
the needs of reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing differ and management believes that a more focused organizational structure will prove to be beneficial 
this decentralized organizational structure should allow each division to focus on all aspects of their business operations and the critical factors required to be successful within a very competitive marketplace 
the company s senior management  treasury and finance and legal functions remain centralized to ensure a consistent level of corporate strategy and oversight 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each line item presented  except for reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing gross profit  which is presented as a percentage of net sales of the respective segments year ended december  net sales  reptron distribution net sales  k byte manufacturing total net sales gross profit  reptron distribution gross profit  k byte manufacturing total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses

for example  although memory module division units shipped increased approximately  memory module division net sales increased by only 
k byte manufacturing s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in the gross margin decreased from in to in during  nine new customers were integrated into the k byte contract manufacturing operation 
in order to meet the demands of this integration process  the company added significant production staff which resulted in production inefficiencies and declining margins 
these actions were necessary to meet the demand of existing customers as well as the commitments made to the new customers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses

interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  from million in to million in the increased borrowings were used to fund higher working capital needs 
currency fluctuation the company pays for its purchases from foreign sources  including japanese manufacturers  in us dollars  which reduces the adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
the company has not experienced substantial adverse effects from currency fluctuations to date 
liquidity and capital resources the company primarily finances its operations through subordinated notes  bank credit lines  capital equipment leases and short term financing through supplier credit lines 
in august  the company completed a million subordinated convertible debt offering

pursuant to the company s amended and restated revolving credit facility the credit facility  four lenders have made available to the company a million revolving credit facility through june  the lenders may advance funds to the company pursuant to two types of loans  each of which bears a separate rate of interest 
as long as the company is not in default under the credit facility  and upon notice to the lender  the company may convert advances from one type of loan to the other 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by all of the company s inventory and accounts receivable 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants including  requiring the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  maintain various financial ratios and limit the amount of capital expenditures 
in addition  the credit facility requires the financial institutions approval of dividends in excess of the lesser of  or of net earnings  thereby restricting the distribution of the retained earnings of the company 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december  the company has entered into various capital lease transactions with several leasing companies to finance capital expenditures  primarily for k byte manufacturing 
these leases had an aggregate balance outstanding of million as of december  the leases bear interest at rates ranging from to and expire at various dates through july  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately million in this decrease in liquidity resulted primarily from a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable  and a million increase in other assets and prepaid expenses

these items were offset by net earnings of million  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued expenses and a million increase in deferred revenue 
the increase in inventory resulted primarily from an decrease in reptron distribution s average inventory turns from times in to times in k byte manufacturing s average inventory turns decreased from times in to times in the company s accounts receivable collections averaged days as of december  and december  the company s capital expenditures  including capital leases  were approximately million in  million in and million in in  the company added  square feet onto its k byte manufacturing facility in gaylord  michigan and initiated construction on a  square foot building adjacent to the corporate headquarters in tampa  florida 
this building was completed in the first quarter of and is used as the main warehouse for reptron distribution and the tampa k byte manufacturing facility 
these items accounted for approximately million of the capital expenditures total 
the continuing construction of the  square foot building accounted for approximately million of the capital expenditures 
reptron distribution warehouse equipment represented approximately  of the total capital expenditures 
the remainder of the capital expenditures in years through were primarily for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment for use in k byte manufacturing 
capital expenditures during the years through were funded through capital leases and bank financing 
on december   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock on the open market 
the company has not yet commenced this stock repurchase 
on february  the company announced it had signed a letter of intent to acquire hibbing electronics corporation  of hibbing  minnesota  by way of a merger with hibbing s parent company 
the company believes available cash reserves and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund this transaction 
the company believes that cash generated from operations  available cash reserves and credit facilities will be sufficient for the company to meet its capital expenditures and working capital needs for its operations as presently conducted 
the company s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities and possible acquisitions 
in particular  if cash flow from operations and available credit facilities are not sufficient  the company will be required to seek additional financing 
while there can be no assurance that such financing would be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to the company  the company believes that such financing would likely be available on acceptable terms
