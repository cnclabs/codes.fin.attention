the company s exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations has been relatively low 
first  the company generally requires payment from its customers in us dollars 
second  the company controls vendor related foreign currency risk both through contractual clauses requiring clients to reimburse the company for any material losses on contracts caused by exchange rate fluctuations and by locking in forward currency contracts 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company utilizes foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitment transactions 
the currency hedged is the british pound 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially reduce the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
as of december   the company had entered into open forward contracts for us dollar british pound sterling transactions with a notional value of approximately  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change in such items versus the prior comparable period percent increase decrease percent of total revenue fiscal year ended december  fiscal fiscal over fiscal over fiscal revenues continuous services other services total revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales  general and administrative product development depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest income and other interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and december  total revenues

the company also committed significant resources in the reorganization of its sales and marketing infrastructure 
this resulted in an increase in recruiting fees  relocation fees and severance payments 
the company anticipates that during the first half of  sales  general and administrative expenses will continue to exceed historical trends due to continued emphasis on building infrastructure

due to the fact that the company competes in a market characterized by rapid and continual technological change  it anticipates adding new products and services which address the increasingly sophisticated  rapidly changing and demanding needs of its customers and their evolving market strategies 
as a result of the uncertainty of these market demands  future product development expenses may fluctuate 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from  in this increase was due to a high level of property and equipment purchases in as a result of a significant increase in number of employees and capital equipment acquisitions during mid year including establishing two new data collection facilities and installation of corporate wide standardized computer platforms  networks and software to accommodate more efficient data communications

income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes represents and of income before income taxes for and  respectively 
the rate is below the company s combined federal and state income tax rates due to a combination of two factors 
the net proceeds from the company s initial and follow on public offerings in have typically been invested in tax free instruments and the company had not recorded any income tax benefit prior to resulting from operating losses generated by pipeline 
selected quarterly operating results the following tables set forth unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning march  and ending december   as well as the percentage of the company s total revenues represented by each item 
in management s opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented  when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k

liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash of million and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
during the twelve months ended december   the company generated million of cash from operations as compared to  during the prior year 
the change is primarily due to an increase in the receivable balances from to in relation to sales causing a greater use of cash from operations in as compared to fiscal years ending december  and the company generated  of cash from operations for the year ended december  as compared to  of cash from operations for the prior year 
the decrease in cash flow from operations was due to a combination of offsetting factors 
although the company s increased earnings provided an increase in cash flow  an increase in its accounts receivable  which resulted from typical billing activity as discussed below  caused an offsetting decrease in cash flow 
pursuant to the billing terms between the company and its customers  the company typically bills customers for products or projects before they have been delivered 
billed amounts are recorded as deferred revenues on the company s financial statements and are recognized as income when earned 
as of december  and  the company had million and million of deferred revenues  respectively 
in addition  when work is performed in advance of billing  the company will record this work as unbilled revenue 
as of december  and  the company had million and million of unbilled revenues  respectively 
substantially all deferred and unbilled revenues will be earned and billed  respectively  within months of the respective period ends 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
during the company invested net proceeds from its initial and follow on public offerings 
there were no public offerings in to generate cash for investment activity 
in cash was used to purchase an exclusive licensing agreement to market and sell customer information products and to acquire property and equipment for an increase in headcount 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities was million and  respectively 
this increase in cash used was primarily due to the company s investment of the net proceeds from its initial and follow on public offerings that closed in march and october  respectively  in short term investments 
the increase also resulted from the relatively high level of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvement expenditures during resulting from the establishment and expansion of new data collection facilities and installation of corporate wide standardized computer platforms  networks and software to accommodate more efficient data communications 
the company periodically considers acquisitions of companies that provide products or services not offered by the company  have strategic customer relationships  are located in attractive geographic locations or have proprietary technologies 
the company may undertake such acquisitions during at present  however  it has no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition other than its acquisition of certain assets of information technology forum  inc in january financing activities provided cash of  during and million during during the company generated net proceeds from its initial and follow on public offerings 
there were no public offerings in to generate cash 
financing activities provided cash of million during fiscal and  during fiscal the increased cash flow was generated by net proceeds from the company s initial and follow on public offerings that closed in march and october  respectively 
during and the company maintained a million revolving bank line of credit to fund cash requirements from time to time 
borrowings under such line of credit bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate and were subject to compliance by the company with certain financial covenants 
the line of credit matured on november  and was not renewed due to quick access to investment balances 
at december  the company held million in short term investments  primarily tax free municipal notes and bonds 
the company believes that the cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
beyond that time  if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company may seek additional funding through bank lines of credit and the sale of its securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such funding can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
year the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the company presently believes  with modification to existing software and converting to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
stock repurchase program in january  the board of directors approved the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock 
as of the date of this filing there have been no repurchases under the plan 
risk factors risks associated with database marketing information services 
the company hopes to achieve a significant portion of its future revenue growth through the expansion of its customer registration business and the development of database marketing products associated with the registration business 
the company has minimal experience in the database marketing industry and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing its new line of database marketing products 
the company also intends to rely in large part on strategic alliances and the acquisition of related technologies in order to expand its offerings under the mkis product lines 
the company s management has limited experience dealing with the issues of product  systems  personnel and business strategy integration posed by such alliances and acquisitions  and no assurance can be given that such alliances and acquisitions will be managed without a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company intends to process its database marketing solutions through an arrangement with first data solutions first data  with whom the company has a perpetual  but cancelable  contract to provide such services 
the company currently has no other means of providing alternative methods of processing in the event of a natural catastrophe  cancellation of the contract  or other unforeseeable event 
in addition  a significant amount of projected database marketing revenues is attributable to a licensing agreement with first data  which is cancelable by either party under certain conditions 
see business growth strategy 
reliance on key customers  technology industry consolidation 
the company has relied on a limited number of key customers for the majority of its revenues 
the company s largest customers in  and generated  and  respectively  of the company s revenues in each of those periods 
in  the company s two largest customers  ibm and hewlett packard  each accounted for over of the company s revenues and together accounted for of revenues 
the company expects that two customers will each account for over of revenues in as well 
substantially all of the company s subscriptions and customer contracts are renewable annually at the option of the company s customers  although no obligation to renew exists and a customer generally has no minimum purchase commitments thereunder 
in addition  there is significant consolidation of companies in the technology industries served by the company  a trend which the company believes will continue 
consolidation among the company s top customers could adversely affect aggregate customer budgets for the company s products and services 
no assurances can be given that the company will maintain its existing customer base or that it will be able to attract new customers 
the loss of one or more of the company s large customers or a significant reduction in business from such customers  regardless of the reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
see business customers and business sales and marketing 
dependence on subscription and contract renewals 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from subscriptions to the company s renewable subscription based products and contracts for renewable proprietary products 
the company expects that a material portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future will continue to be derived from such subscriptions and contracts 
substantially all such subscriptions and customer contracts are renewable annually at the option of the company s customers  although no obligation to renew exists and a customer generally has no minimum purchase commitments thereunder 
to the extent that customers fail to renew or defer their renewals from the quarter anticipated by the company  the company s quarterly results may be materially adversely affected 
the company s ability to secure renewals is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to deliver consistent  high quality and timely data 
in addition  the marketing and market research activities of the company s customers are dependent on the timing of their new product introductions  size of marketing budgets  operating performance  industry and economic conditions and changes in management or ownership 
as a result of such factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historically high renewal rates 
any material decline in renewal rates from such levels would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
see business sales and marketing 
fluctuations in operating results  seasonality 
the company s operating results in any particular fiscal period have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future due to various factors 
the company expects that revenues from customer registration products will continue to increase during however  such revenues are primarily a function of the timing of customer shipments  which can be difficult to forecast and over which the company has no control 
any delay in customer orders for the company s customer registration products  or a decrease in orders due to adoption by customers of custom software applications  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
substantially all revenues and expenses attributable to the company s cims product for a particular year are recognized when the final study is completed and delivered  usually in the third quarter of that year 
delay in delivering the final study in any given year could postpone recognition of such revenues and expenses until the fourth quarter of such year  which would materially affect operating results for such third and fourth quarters 
furthermore  all costs related to cims are included in cost of revenues and none are allocated to sales  general and administrative costs  which tends to reduce the company s third quarter gross margin below that of other quarters 
many of the company s customers operate in industry segments that are becoming increasingly seasonal as technology vendors have increased their focus on consumer markets  with sales in the fourth calendar quarter constituting a growing portion of the annual sales of such customers 
this may translate into seasonal demand for the company s products  particularly the customer registration products 
in addition  the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of orders from customers  the size and timing of orders for customer registration products  response rates on customer information products  delays in development and customer acceptance of custom software applications  product or panel development expenses  new product or service introductions or announcements by the company or its competitors  levels of market acceptance for new products and services  the hiring and training of additional staff and customer demand for market research  as well as general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of the company s overhead is fixed in the short term and because spending commitments must be made in advance of revenue commitments by customers  the company s results of operations may be materially adversely affected in any particular quarter if revenues fall below the company s expectations 
these factors  among others  make it likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
management of growth  possible acquisitions 
since inception  the company s growth has placed significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
in order to manage its growth  the company will need to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems and continue to expand  motivate and effectively manage an evolving and expanding workforce 
if the company s management is unable to effectively manage under such circumstances  the quality of the company s products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to expand 
the company s growth could be adversely affected by reductions in customers spending on market research or customer information products  increased competition  possible pricing pressures and other general economic trends 
although market research expenditures by technology companies have increased in recent years as such companies have adopted certain marketing strategies traditionally utilized by consumer goods manufacturers  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that technology companies will continue to rely on externally generated market research to enhance the marketing of their products 
the company hopes to achieve a portion of its future revenue growth  if any  through acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  although the company currently has no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
as part of this strategy  the company merged with zona research  inc zona research in february and acquired certain assets of information technology forum  inc itf in january the company s management has limited experience dealing with the issues of product  systems  personnel and business strategy integration posed by acquisitions  and no assurance can be given that the integration of the pipeline and zona research mergers  the itf acquisition  or any possible future acquisitions will be managed without a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any possible future acquisition will not dilute the company s earnings per share 
see business growth strategy 
competition 
overall  the technology focused market research industry is highly competitive 
the company has traditionally competed directly with relatively small  local providers of survey based technology focused market research 
the company also competes directly with third party providers of customer information software  such as leader  inc  as well as vendors own customer information software 
in addition  the company competes indirectly with significant providers of i analyst based  technology focused market research such as gartner group  inc  meta group  inc 
and forrester research  inc  ii survey based  general market research such as nfo research  inc  market facts  inc  information resources  inc 
and the npd group  inc  iii analyst based  general business consulting and iv database marketing such as axciom corporation and metromail corporation 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than the company and could decide to increase their resource commitments to the company s market 
moreover  each of these companies currently competes indirectly  if not directly  for funds available within aggregate industry wide market research budgets 
there are few barriers to entry into the company s market  and the company expects increased competition in one or more market segments addressed by the company  which could adversely affect the company s operating results through pricing pressure  required increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share  among other factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors 
see business competition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel who have expertise in developing  interpreting and selling survey based information for technology markets 
although customer relationships are managed at many levels in the company  the loss of one or more of intelliquest s corporate officers or senior managers could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s success may also depend on its ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of its business 
competition for qualified personnel in the company s industry is intense  and many of the companies with which the company competes for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
furthermore  competition for qualified personnel can be expected to become more intense as competition in the company s industry increases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel to compete successfully 
expansion of direct sales force 
the company has historically relied on customer referrals  supplemented by its own sales and marketing efforts  to generate the majority of its revenue growth 
during the second half of the company began to develop a formal sales management structure and has increased the sales force in from to individuals 
as the company develops new products and services targeted at more complex  integrated marketing solutions  it intends to continue to expand its sales force 
the company s plans for future growth may depend in part on  among other things  its unproven ability to hire  train  deploy  manage and retain an increasingly large and more sophisticated direct sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop or manage such a sales force 
see business sales and marketing 
rapid technological change and new product introduction 
the company s customers compete in markets characterized by rapid  continual technological change 
the company s success will depend in part upon its ability to anticipate and keep pace with rapidly changing technology and to add new products and services which address the increasingly sophisticated  rapidly changing and demanding needs of its customers and their evolving market strategies 
in particular  the company is expending significant resources to develop its proprietary customer information products to take advantage of certain market opportunities 
however  such software products may contain defects following customization or when new versions are released  the company has in the past discovered software defects in certain of its products and may experience delays or lost revenue to correct such defects in the future 
in addition  the significant growth in the use of the world wide web has created the opportunity to use the internet as an information transmission medium 
accordingly  the company is expending significant resources to develop internet based information collection tools 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis  these or other new or improved products and services that adequately and competitively address the needs of the marketplace 
any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely data in a manner that meets rapidly changing market needs could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results 
see business products and services and business product development and technology 
data collection risks 
the company currently collects information both telephonically and electronically 
in addition  certain of the company s new products and services involve the use of the internet and commercial online services to gather information from end users for processing and sale to customers of the company 
a number of legislative initiatives exist domestically and abroad that seek to regulate the telephonic or electronic collection of data about persons 
in addition  an increasing number of court cases have been brought seeking damages and injunctive relief for actions allegedly violating so called rights of privacy 
the law in this area  both statutory and case law  is highly unsettled 
no assurance can be given  therefore  that the company will be allowed to continue to pursue existing or proposed new products and services 
in addition  the company s ability to provide timely and accurate market research to its customers depends on its ability to collect large quantities of high quality data through interviews  customer registrations  product satisfaction questionnaires and certain other surveys 
if receptivity to the company s customer registration  interview and survey methods by respondents declines  or for some other reason their willingness to complete and return surveys  registrations  or other information declines  or if the company for any reason cannot rely on the integrity of the data it receives  it would reduce the quantity and or quality of the data the company seeks to disseminate and would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market and sell its market research products and on its results of operations 
see business products and services 
risks related to cims 
cims is one of the leading databases of media readership and viewership habits of both business and household technology purchase influencers in the united states 
because many advertisers use cims data as a key component in their media buying decisions and because many media companies use cims data to promote their media properties  such data can have a significant impact on advertiser demand for  and advertising rates charged by  such media properties 
in the past  it has not been unusual for media companies with properties that have not performed well in the studies to be dissatisfied with the results of the studies or the manner in which such results have been used by their competitors 
furthermore  the company in revised data from a study that was inaccurate due to software defects  which it remedied and disclosed to its customers 
although neither media company dissatisfaction nor the inaccurate study has resulted in litigation against the company  there can be no assurance that the company will not face future litigation as a result of media company dissatisfaction with cims or the results thereof  and if initiated  that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
history of net losses  uncertain profitability 
the company incurred net losses in each year from through before recording a net profit in each of and and in view of the company s prior operating history  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that it will be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods 
limited protection of proprietary systems  software and procedures 
the company s success is in part dependent upon its proprietary software technology  research methods  data analysis techniques  and internal systems and procedures that it has developed specifically to serve customers in the technology industry 
the company has no patents  consequently  it relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary systems  software and procedures 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems  software or procedures 
the company believes that its systems  software and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into materially adverse license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims

risks associated with international operations 
revenues attributable to international market research represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues for  and the company expects that revenues from international market research will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international market research efforts 
however  the company s international data collection operations are subject to numerous inherent challenges and risks  including maintenance of an international data collection network that adheres to the company s quality standards  fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign political and economic conditions  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  demand for the company s international market research depends on the international sales and operations of its customers  which may increase or decrease over time 
the addition of market research coverage in new geographic territories can be expected to require the commitment of considerable management and financial resources and may negatively impact the company s near term results of operations 
any material decline in the company s ability to provide and market timely  high quality data that is consistent across international markets would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including quarterly variations in operating results  the signing of new contracts  new customers  consolidations in the industry  technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights  general conditions in the technology focused market research industry  revised earnings estimates  comments or recommendations issued by analysts who follow the company  its competitors or the technology focused  market research industry and general economic and market conditions 
in addition  it is possible that in some future period the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
volatility in price and volume has had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies for reasons unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock
