such statements are based on the current assumptions of dataware management  which are believed to be reasonable 
however  they are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the important factors described under certain factors that may affect future results below and in exhibit to this annual report which is incorporated herein by reference that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
overview dataware s revenues are composed of software license fees and service revenues 
the overall gross margin of the company fluctuates depending upon the mix of business among these categories of revenues 
in recent years  recurring revenue has been a significant portion of total revenues  comprising approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
recurring software license revenues result from annual renewal of retrieval licenses and certain other fees 
recurring service revenues have historically resulted from data services to support customers in their use of dataware software products  database hosting and software maintenance fees 
the decrease in recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenues from to was primarily due to the sale of a portion of the data services business to information handling services group  inc ihs 
the company currently anticipates that recurring revenues will comprise a smaller portion of total revenues going forward 
acquisitions have contributed significantly to the company s growth 
among the most recent have been the acquisitions of software developers status iq ltd  ntergaid inc  and green book international corporation  as well as two multimedia services and software companies  ledge multimedia  inc and creative multimedia corporation 
on september   dataware sold a portion of its data services business to ihs in exchange for cash and the stock of ihs s subsidiary  creative multimedia corporation of portland  oregon 
the portion of the business sold included certain contracts and other assets of dataware  as well as the stock of the company s australian  canadian  german  italian and swedish subsidiaries 
the activities of the data services business sold consisted of processing customer text and data and using it to create information distribution products 
at the same time  the company entered into a distribution agreement with ihs under which ihs took over the software distribution activities formerly performed by the five divested foreign subsidiaries 
following this transaction  the company is a leaner organization  having reduced headcount from immediately before the transaction to as of december  expenses are expected to be commensurately lower going forward 
it is anticipated that the ihs transaction will have an effect on other aspects of the company s financial performance as well 
for example  services revenues are anticipated to be substantially lower in the future as the company focuses on its software and multimedia businesses 
the company also entered into agreements with ihs under which it will provide software and multimedia services for use by ihs in its publishing activities 
since its inception  dataware has generated significant revenues outside of north america 
until the ihs transaction on september   dataware had international direct sales organizations in germany  the united kingdom  italy  france  sweden  denmark  australia  singapore  and canada 
as of december   the company had direct sales organizations in the united kingdom  denmark and singapore and has distribution agreements covering other european countries  the pacific rim  and south america 
the company s sales from operations outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
the company s foreign subsidiaries are principally engaged in software sales  customer service and distribution activities 
results of operations the company s results for the twelve month period ended december   have been restated to combine the former systems integration category with the services category in the revenues and cost of revenues sections in the statement of operations 
as compared to revenues the company s total revenues remained relatively flat at million in and million in software license fees increased to million in from million in  a million increase 
software license fees include revenues from systems and tools  applications and custom software products 
software license revenue growth in was primarily due to million in software revenues under the new agreements with ihs 
service revenues decreased to million in from million in  a million decrease 
service revenues are primarily derived from project management  custom software development  production services  software maintenance and ledge multimedia development 
this decrease in service revenue reflects the company s continuing shift away from the provision of services  and towards increased sales of software products 
this shift was furthered by the agreement with ihs  under which a portion of the data services business was sold 
the company expects that  as a result of the ihs transaction  its services revenues will be lower going forward 
accordingly  overall revenues may be reduced significantly in the near term 
cost of revenues the total cost of revenues in was million or lower than costs of million in as a percent of total revenues  total cost of revenues was of revenues in  as compared to of revenues in this decrease is largely due to a million one time charge that was recorded in the second quarter of for the write down of less productive software assets to their net realizable value 
a continuing shift away from the higher cost services business also contributed to the decrease 
excluding the effect of the million one time charge referred to above  cost of software licenses represented of software license revenue in  down from in cost of software licenses consists of the amortization of capitalized software  license fees to third party suppliers  the cost of software product packaging  media  documentation  and certain employee costs related to software support 
the primary reason for this decrease in costs was the increase in software license fees as fixed expenses decreased 
the decrease in fixed costs is in large part related to the completion of a contractual royalty commitment with a third party in the second quarter of cost of services represented of service revenue in both and cost of services consists primarily of personnel expenses  certain overhead costs and the cost of third party services 
gross profit total gross profit was million  up from million in  representing of total revenues in and in in addition to the one time charge mentioned previously  the increase in total gross profit from year to year was due to lower costs within each revenue category and a shift in product mix to higher margin software products from relatively lower margin services 
management anticipates that gross profit as a percentage of revenues will continue to improve because the ihs transaction has greatly reduced the portion of lower margin services in the company s product mix 
however  there are a number of important factors that could adversely affect the company s future gross profit  resulting in higher than anticipated costs and or lower than anticipated revenues 
these factors include the existence of strong competition for the company s products and services  including the introduction of new products from competitors  the timing of which cannot be foreseen by the company  the inherent risks of new product introductions  including uncertainty of customer acceptance  and the company s reliance on third parties for supply of certain product components 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily caused by the ihs transaction  which divested the company of certain business activities in the us and us  as well as five foreign subsidiaries that had been principally involved in distributing dataware products 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in it is anticipated that sales and marketing expenses will continue to decrease in the near term  as the company receives the benefit of the divested subsidiaries for the full year 
product development expenses product development expenses excluding capitalized software expenditures decreased to million in from million in product development expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in product development expenses in real dollars  as well as in relation to total revenues  is due in part to expenses related to northern light technology corporation  a subsidiary whose assets were sold on april   as described in liquidity and capital resources below
