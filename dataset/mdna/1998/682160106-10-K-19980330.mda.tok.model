revenues during were also affected by a satellite outage in january affecting certain spectravision properties and the termination and sale of approximately  rooms during the second half of the year that were receiving satellite only pay per view ppv movies 
the company discontinued satellite distribution of movies due to the high costs of this delivery method 
management believes these two events reduced revenue in by approximately million to million 
video system sales and other revenues decreased by million or to million as compared to million in  reflecting a slowdown in ordering of video systems from two of the company s primary licensees 
total direct cost of revenues increased by million or to million in as compared to million in direct costs associated with movie revenue increased million or to million in as compared to the prior year  and as a percentage of movie revenue increased to in from in the percentage increase reflects a lower recovery of free to guest programming costs from hotels  higher royalties on feature movies  and higher hotel commission expenses on spectravision room revenues 
direct costs from video system sales and other revenues decreased million or to million  as compared to million in  as a result of a decline in sales of video systems 
direct costs as a percentage of video system sales and other revenues decreased to in from in the improved gross margin was largely due to higher margin on used systems sold to skylink  and other revenues from equipment rental and video interactive services  which have minimal direct costs 
operations costs  which consist primarily of labor and material expense required to maintain the existing equipment in hotels  increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  and as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to the higher field service costs necessary to support the acquired spectravision equipment  the spectravision spare part depot used to refurbish spectravision equipment  and expenses associated with the satellite outage  as previously discussed 
research and development expenses in increased million or to million as compared to million in the reason for the increase is due to the engineering support requirement of the existing spectravision platforms and the development of the company s new digital technologies 
the increase consisted of personnel and consulting service costs of million 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to costs to support the company s much larger room base  including the spectravision hotels  costs associated with the integration of spectravision s and ocv s accounting and operational systems and higher administrative costs associated with being a public company with an expanded international presence 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in these expenses are primarily attributable to depreciable assets associated with video systems that generate movie revenue 
the dollar increase reflects capital investments associated with growing the ocv room base and with incremental depreciation and amortization resulting from the acquisition of spectravision s in room assets and intangible assets 
interest other expense net increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase was due to the company s reliance on debt financing to continue its expansion of its installed customer base  debt used to complete the acquisition of spectravision and the write down of a minority investment to its estimated fair value 
provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
the income tax expense in represents tax on income in foreign jurisdictions 
the company has not recorded a tax benefit in from the net operating losses generated in that year because it has established a valuation allowance against its otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets at december   due to the uncertainty surrounding the reliability of these benefits in future tax returns 
the company s international presence grew from approximately  rooms at january  to approximately  rooms at december  primarily due to the spectravision acquisition 
redeemable common stock accretion was eliminated in as this security was converted to common stock in the accretion in was million 
ebitda increased to million in from million in or an increase of 
as a percent of revenue  ebitda decreased from in to in the major factor in this reduction was the increase in operations  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  explained above 
net loss increased to million in from million in due to the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased million or to million in  as compared to total revenues of million in movie revenues increased million or from previous year 
such increase was primarily attributable to movie revenue generated from rooms acquired from spectravision million  increasing number of ocv s installed on demand rooms of  in  as compared to  in  and  to a lesser degree  a selected price increase by ocv 
video system sales and other revenues decreased by million or to million as compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of the elimination of the low margin video system sales to ascent following ascent s contribution to ocv of ascent s hotel video assets the contribution pursuant to the contribution agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the contribution also resulted in the elimination of the revenue from video management services from ascent which totaled million in total direct cost of revenues increased million or to million in  as compared to million in direct costs associated with movie revenue increased million or to million in as compared to prior year  and as a percentage of movie revenue increased to in from in the dollar increase was attributable to the acquisition of spectravision million and increased number of rooms serviced by ocv 
the percentage decrease was due to lower margins on spectravision rooms  increased free to guest costs  increased property tax expense and slightly declining revenue on a per room basis at ocv 
direct costs from video system sales and other revenues decreased million or to million  as compared to million in the decrease was the result of elimination of video system sales and video management service to ascent described above 
operations costs  which consist primarily of labor and material expense required to maintain the existing on demand equipment  increased million or to million  as compared to million in  and as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to the additional labor and material necessary to maintain the growing volume of installed on demand equipment  and higher field service costs to support the acquired spectravision equipment 
research and development expenses increased million or to million as compared to million in  as a result of the company s continuing commitment to maintain and enhance existing products  develop new products  and create commonality with spectravision s video systems 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to higher levels of business activity  increased facility costs resulting from the addition of the former spectravision headquarters in richardson  texas  non recurring costs including transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of spectravision  employee relocation and severance costs including former spectravision employees  and the relocation of company headquarters to san jose  california 
non recurring costs account for approximately million of the increase 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to capital investments associated with installing on demand service in hotel rooms million  the acquisition of assets in from ascent under the contribution agreement million  and the acquisition of spectravision million 
interest other expense net increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase is due to the company s greater reliance on debt financing to continue the expansion of its installed customer base  and debt used to complete the acquisition of spectravision 
provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the net loss in offset by higher foreign taxes resulting from the acquisition of spectravision 
the company has not recorded a tax benefit in from the net operating losses generated in that year because it has established a valuation allowance against its otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets at december   due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these benefits in future tax returns 
redeemable common stock accretion decreased to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease of million or 
concurrent with the merger and acquisition  the redeemable common stock was converted to common stock of the company 
therefore  accretion was recorded for a partial year in compared to a full year in ebitda increased to million in from million in  reflecting an increase of million or 
ebitda  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased to in from in eliminating non recurring adjustments  ebitda totaled million in or of total revenues 
the reduced percentage is primarily due to the higher operating costs currently associated with the spectravision business  higher free to guest costs  and higher administrative expense necessary to operate as a public company 
net income loss decreased to a net loss of million in from net income of million in due to the factors described above 
seasonality the company s business is expected to be seasonal where revenues are influenced principally by hotel occupancy rates and the buy rate or percentage of occupied rooms at hotels that buy movies or other services at the property 
higher revenues are generally realized during the summer months and lower revenues realized during the winter months due to business and vacation travel patterns which impact the lodging industry s occupancy rates 
buy rates generally reflect the hotel s guest demographic mix  the popularity of the motion picture or services available at the hotel and the guests other entertainment alternatives 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of cash during were cash from operations of million  and net borrowings of million from the company s revolving credit facility 
cash was expended primarily for capital expenditures which totaled million  primarily for the installation of on demand systems and the conversion of spectravision systems in hotels 
the company s principal cash requirements in are expected to include the continued conversion of spectravision properties to ocv s more dependable on demand technology  the installation of systems in new hotels  both domestically and abroad  and the selected deployment of the company s new digital technology 
the company anticipates these activities will require capital expenditures of approximately to million in the company believes that its internally generated cash and its remaining capacity under its credit facility will provide sufficient funding for the foreseeable future 
revolving credit facility on november   the company refinanced its former credit facility and entered into an amended and restated agreement the credit facility with nationsbank of texas  na nationsbank 
under the amended credit facility  the amount available to the company was increased from million to million  and certain other terms were amended 
the credit facility matures in november and  subject to certain conditions  can be renewed for two additional years 
at december   there was million of available borrowings under the credit facility  subject to certain covenant restrictions 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
limitations on additional debt financing on command and ascent entered into a corporate agreement  as amended the corporate agreement pursuant to which occ has agreed  among other things  not to incur any indebtedness without ascent s prior written consent  other than indebtedness under the credit facility  and indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of operations  which together shall not exceed million through december  subsequent to december   the corporate agreement was amended to increase the occ indebtedness limit to million through december  foreign exchange the company believes the risks of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its present operations are not material to the company s overall financial condition 
however  should the company s international operations continue to grow  occ will consider using foreign currency contracts  swap arrangements  or other financial instruments designed to limit exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rates and inflation fluctuations in interest rates and inflation have not had a material effect on the operations of the company to date 
however  if management believes the direction of future interest rates pose a significant risk to the operations of the company  it will consider using interest rate contracts  swap arrangements  or other financial instruments designed to limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
business risks control by ascent ascent owned approximately of the outstanding occ common stock at december  accordingly  ascent has the ability to control the management and policies of on command corporation and the outcome of matters submitted to the stockholders for approval  including the election of directors 
restrictions on debt and equity financings pursuant to the corporate agreement entered into between ascent and on command corporation  as amended  on command corporation has agreed  among other things  not to incur any indebtedness without ascent s prior written consent  other than indebtedness under the credit facility and indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of operations  which together shall not exceed million in the aggregate  and not to issue any equity security without the prior written consent of ascent 
restrictions on on command corporation s ability to incur additional debt and equity could adversely affect on command corporation s plans for growth  its ability to develop new products and technologies and its ability to meet its liquidity needs 
dependence on additional capital for growth the growth of on command corporation s business requires substantial investment on a continuing basis to finance capital expenditures and related expenses 
prior to the acquisition  ocv relied on capital provided by comsat and ascent and cash flow from operations to finance its growth 
on command corporation intends to use cash flow from operations and additional borrowings subject to the limitations discussed under restrictions on debt financings to support its growth 
whether or when on command corporation can achieve intended cash flow levels sufficient to completely support its anticipated growth cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  on command corporation may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities subject to the limitations described under restrictions on debt financings  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for growth or  alternatively  may have to reduce growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
on command corporation can give no assurances with respect to the impact on the results of operations and financial condition if on command corporation is required to reduce growth to a level that can be supported by internally generated cash flow 
integration of ocv and spectravision businesses while the company has substantially completed the integration of spectravision s operating systems  financial reporting  sales  marketing and management  certain information systems require further integration and a significant portion of the installed base of hotel rooms acquired in the spectravision acquisition remains to be converted to occ s on demand technology 
management expects that this conversion process  which is scheduled to be completed by the end of  will result in financial improvement due to increased revenues attributable to ocv system s on demand capabilities and reduced system downtime  as well as lower field service costs 
there can be no assurance that the conversion process will be completed on schedule or that the desired financial improvements will be realized 
the inability to complete the conversion process on schedule and realize such financial improvements could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of occ 
thinly traded stock in the public market and possible volatility of stock price as approximately of the outstanding on command common stock  is traded on the nasdaq stock market as of march   the public market for the occ common stock and the on command corporation warrants may not be subject to an active public market which can be sustained 
further  the stock markets may experience volatility that affects the market prices of companies in ways unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the occ common stock or warrants 
highly competitive in room entertainment industry the hotel in room entertainment industry is highly competitive 
due to the high level of penetration in the united states lodging industry already achieved by participants in the in room entertainment industry and the current rate of construction and expansion of hotel properties in the united states  most of the growth opportunities in the in room entertainment industry currently involve securing contracts to serve hotels that are already being served by a competing vendor  expanding internationally and broadening the range of services provided 
these circumstances have led to increasing competition for contract renewals  particularly at hotels operated by major hotel chains 
there can be no assurance that occ will obtain new contracts with hotels currently served by other vendors or that on command corporation will be able to retain contracts with the hotels served by ocv and spectravision when those contracts expire 
the loss by occ of one or more of the major hotel chain customers  such as marriott or hilton  could have a material adverse impact on on command corporation s results of operations 
see dependence on significant customers 
in addition  there are a number of potential competitors that could utilize their existing infrastructure to provide in room entertainment to the lodging industry  including cable companies including wireless cable  telecommunications companies  and direct to home and direct broadcast satellite companies 
some of these potential competitors already are providing free to guest services to hotels and testing video on demand 
some of these potential competitors have substantially greater resources than on command corporation 
furthermore  particularly in the provision of internet services to the hotel guest  the company anticipates that it will face competition from traditional in room entertainment competitors as well as new competitors  some of whom may have access to additional capital resources that occ does not have 
dependence on significant customers hotels affiliated with marriott  holiday inn and hilton accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of on command corporation s revenues for the year ended december  the loss of any of these customers  or the loss of a significant number of other hotel chain customers  could have a material adverse effect on on command corporation s results of operations or financial condition 
however  these customers represent both chain owned managed hotels  as well as franchisees 
the company often has different contracts on different terms with the chain owned managed hotels  on the one hand  and with the franchisees or groups of franchisees  on the other 
dependence on performance of lodging industry the business of on command is closely linked to the performance of the hotel industry in which occupancy rates have recently been near their all time high 
declines in hotel occupancy as a result of general business  economic  seasonal and other factors can have a significant adverse impact on on command corporation s results of operations 
technological developments technology in the entertainment  information and communications industry is continuously changing as new technologies and developments continue to be introduced 
there can be no assurance that future technological advances will not result in improved equipment or software systems that could adversely affect on command corporation s competitive position 
in order to remain competitive  on command corporation must maintain the programming enhancements  engineering and technical capability and flexibility to respond to customer demands for new or improved versions of its systems and new technological developments 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in developing new technology and systems or in enhancing existing technology and systems or that new or enhanced technology and systems  including but not limited to on command s digital and internet access technologies will timely meet market requirements 
the company has  from time to time  experienced delays in introducing new technology and there can be no assurance that on command corporation will have the financial or technological resources to be successful in its future introductions of new technology 
dependence on key personnel on command corporation s success will be dependent upon the contributions of its executive officers  especially robert m 
kavner  its president and chief executive officer and brian ac steel  its executive vice president  chief financial officer and chief operating officer 
the loss of the services of such executive officers could have a material adverse effect on on command corporation 
on command corporation s success also depends on its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that on command corporation or its subsidiaries will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
messrs 
kavner and steel have entered into employment agreements with on command corporation 
seasonality the company s business is expected to be seasonal where revenues are influenced principally by hotel occupancy rates and the buy rate or percentage of occupied rooms at hotels that buy movies or other services at the property 
higher revenues are generally realized during the summer months and lower revenues realized during the winter months due to business and vacation travel patterns which impact the lodging industry s occupancy rates 
buy rates generally reflect the hotel s guest demographic mix  the popularity of the motion picture or services available at the hotel and the guests other entertainment alternatives 
programming the cost to the company to license feature movies from major motion picture studios is subject to change as the major motion picture studios continue to negotiate for higher royalty rates and higher minimum payments by the company  as well as a shorter hotel motel pay per view window 
such changes may have adverse impacts on the company s earnings 
in addition the company has experienced periods of  and may continue to experience periods of  slight declines in its movie buy rates 
while the company is taking measures to address such trends  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will prove effective 
in addition  as the company tests and begins marketing of new programming alternatives for guests  there can be no assurance that such programming will timely meet market requirements 
year the company has developed preliminary plans to address the possible exposure related to the impact on its computer systems of the year key financial information and operational and product systems have been assessed and plans have been developed to address systems modifications required by december  the financial impact of making the required systems changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
in addition  the company will be communicating with others with whom it does significant business  including but not limited to its suppliers and hotel customers  to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company
