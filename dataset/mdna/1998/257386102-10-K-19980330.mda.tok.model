the latter programs directly contributed to a decrease in the amount of time from the company acceptance of the sales contract to the home delivery date 
favorable economic conditions  generally stable interest rates  a mild winter season and selective price increases also contributed to the favorable results 
one of the company s key strengths has been its ability to identify and acquire property to be used as lots for future residential home development 
the company generally develops and sells land within a three to five year period from the date of its acquisition 
following two years of strong homebuilding sales and limited land acquisitions  the company increased its land inventory in investment in land and land development inventories increased to million at december  from million at the end of substantially all of such increase in land and land development inventories occurred as a result of an increase in finished lots in inventory 
undeveloped land and land in development remained relatively constant between the two periods 
the company s objective in creating the larger inventory of developed lots as of december  is to meet the anticipated demand during the first half of a portion of the company s growth in included activities which are complementary to its core homebuilding business

most of the implementation of these upgrades will take place during company outlook the company believes that it is well positioned for future growth in due to the record number of homes in backlog at the end of  strong sales activity in early  further implementation of operational and administrative improvements  and ongoing cost control programs  combined with the expected continuation of a favorable economic environment 
the company believes that these factors  in conjunction with the addition of five additional sales locations in central ohio  will lead to a positive comparison with results 
the company s growth strategy is to maximize sales in each of the company s existing sales locations in central ohio as well as to increase the overall number of its sales locations within central ohio 
additionally  the company has been actively evaluating opportunities to expand regionally to new markets outside of central ohio

key financial  information and operations systems have been assessed and plans developed in order to mitigate the year issues 
these plans include upgrades of purchased software and conversion of in house developed software 
the company is currently in various stages of implementing the upgrades and expects to invest between million in this effort with the cost to be allocated over a five year period 
costs of replacing computer software programs are expected to be primarily accounted for and financed as operating leases 
the costs of reprogramming computer programs that are not replaced will be expensed as incurred and are not expected to be material 
all programs subject to year concerns will be evaluated utilizing internal and external resources to reprogram  replace and test 
the company intends to initiate during a communication plan with significant suppliers to determine the status of their year compliance programs

seasonality and variability in quarterly results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
typically  closings and related revenues will increase in the second half of the year 
the company believes that this seasonality reflects the tendency of home buyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings

for purposes of financial reporting  the company capitalizes these costs to real estate inventories on the basis of the ratio of estimated annual indirect costs to direct construction costs to be incurred 
thus  variations in construction activity cause fluctuations in interim and annual gross profits

these tax benefits were fully utilized in liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s capital needs have depended upon sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
the company s traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
the company has incurred substantial indebtedness in the past and expects to incur substantial indebtedness in the future to fund its operations and its investment in land 
during  the company began to explore expanding into areas outside of central ohio 
such expansion will require additional capital resources  particularly if such expansion would be accomplished through the acquisition of one or more homebuilders 
to meet this need  the company is exploring additional sources of capital to augment its traditional sources

real estate inventories the company s practice is to develop most of the lots upon which it builds its homes 
the company generally does not buy unimproved land for speculation and generally limits its investment in unimproved land to an amount it expects to be able to develop and sell within the next three to five years 
at december   the company either owned or had under contract to purchase lots or land that could be developed into approximately  lots  and the company controlled through option agreements an additional  lots 
included in the  lots controlled through option agreements were lots owned by brc 
during  the company exercised options to purchase  controlled lots  including lots from brc 
option agreements expire at varying dates through june  the company s decision to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land is based upon an assessment of a number of factors  including its existing land inventory at the time and its evaluation of the future demand for its homes 
during  the company sold lots and land to other builders for million 
land and land development costs at december  increased from the previous year end as a result of increased sales activity  replacement of land inventory depleted but not replaced during the previous two years and a need to replace lots no longer available to the company from brc 
homes under construction also increased from year end as a result of having more homes under construction and having homes generally at a more advanced stage of construction 
the aggregate investment in inventory homes  however  declined million to million at december  from million at december  on december   the company had inventory homes in various stages of construction  compared to inventory homes in various stages of construction at december  unsold inventory homes are not reflected in sales or backlog 
also included in real estate inventories are building materials and supplies 
seller provided debt the company had million and million of seller provided term debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
on december   the company exercised an option to purchase land for a purchase price of million  of which the seller agreed to finance million over four years 
the interest rate on the note payable is 
interest rates on the remaining seller provided debt  which matures within three years  are at and prime 
land purchase commitments at december   the company had commitments to purchase residential lots and unimproved land at an aggregate cost of million  of which million is expected to be funded during in addition  at december   the company had cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land of million  of which million is expected to be funded during the company had invested  in good faith deposits in these cancelable purchase obligations at december  included in the million of cancelable purchase obligations are million of purchase options with brc 
bank credit facility the company s bank credit facility has a maturity date of june  and provides for revolving loans and letters of credit limited to million in the aggregate of up to million in the aggregate  subject to borrowing base limitations 
as of december   the company had million available under its bank credit facility  after adjustment for borrowing base limitations 
the bank credit facility is not collateralized 
see note to the notes to the financial statements 
the company is exploring additional sources of capital to augment its existing sources 
as part of that effort  the company also is discussing with certain of its bankers a new bank credit facility that would replace the existing facility and would provide certain more favorable terms to the company 
the company has entered into two contracts to fix the interest rate on a total of million of borrowings under its bank credit facility 
each contract fixed the interest rate on million of the outstanding revolving line of credit for a term of three years expiring in october and january  respectively 
the interest rate on the first contract was fixed at a three month eurodollar rate of plus a variable margin and the interest rate on the second contract was fixed at a three month eurodollar rate of plus a variable margin 
the variable margin is determined quarterly  based upon the company s leverage ratio  and can range from to 
at december   the variable margin was  and the company s overall effective borrowing rate was approximately 
inflation and other cost increases the company is not always able to reflect all of its cost increases in the prices of its homes because competitive pressures and other factors require it in many cases to maintain or discount those prices 
after a sales contract has been accepted  the company is generally able to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date the sales contract is accepted until the date construction is completed  however  unanticipated additional costs may be incurred between the date a sales contract is accepted and the date construction is completed 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require the company  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  additional costs may be incurred to obtain subcontractor availability when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits
