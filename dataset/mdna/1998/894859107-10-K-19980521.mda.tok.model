item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general until recent years  the company s net sales have been primarily attributable to its mail order catalog operations  especially sales of power and hand tools and accessories 
beginning with fiscal  the company derived a greater portion of its net sales from its retail store operations than its mail order catalog operations 
during fiscal  the company continued the expansion of its retail store operations  opening woodworkers warehouse and post tool  and golf day retail stores  which includes the acquisition of nevada bob s franchised stores in january  which were immediately converted to golf day retail stores 
the company expects that the expansion of its retail store operations will continue to generate an increasing percentage of the company s future growth 
as of february   the company operated woodworkers warehouse and post tool retail stores and golf day retail stores 
the following table presents net sales and overall gross margin data of the company for the periods indicated fiscal years ended february  march  march  in thousands  except percentage data net sales retail tools    golf    catalog trend lines    golf day    total    gross margin on an overall basis  the company s catalog sales yield higher gross profit margins than retail store sales as a result of differences in product mix and greater promotional pricing in retail sales 
therefore  the company anticipates that its total gross profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease as retail store sales become a greater percentage of the company s total sales 
during fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in its gross profit as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal  primarily due its changing sales mix 
the catalog business has both substantially higher gross margins and expenses than does a retail store 
therefore  as the contribution from retail stores becomes a larger proportion of total sales  gross margins and selling  general and administrative expenses will have a natural downward bias 
with respect to both catalog and retail store operations  sales of golf products have yielded higher gross profit percentages than sales of tools 
in february  the company implemented a warehouse management system in order to more efficiently and accurately process inventory through its distribution center 
as a result of conversion to the new system  the orderly flow of merchandise to the company s retail and catalog customers was interrupted 
while this problem may have an impact on the company s first quarter results  the company is of the current view that future operations will not be adversely affected by issues related to its warehouse management system

like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risk for the company 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  it could have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is currently updating its software to accommodate programming logic that properly interprets year dates 
except for merchandising and call center applications  all software is under maintenance agreements by software companies that provide updated  year compliant software 
the company is in the process of replacing its call center and merchandising software with new  industry leading year compliant applications to be supplied by outside vendors at a cost estimated at approximately million
