change in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its fiscal year end from the saturday following september to a fiscal year of or weeks ending on the saturday nearest october fiscal included weeks and ended november  fiscal years and included weeks and ended on november  and october   respectively 
this change in the company s fiscal periods was made primarily to improve the company s operational efficiencies 
by moving the company s fiscal periods out one month  the company s manufacturing operations have incurred reduced overtime payments during the december and july holiday periods 
also  because many of the company s distributors have calendar quarter ends and place orders in the third month of the quarter  the company has not always been able to process and ship these orders during this third month of the calendar quarter because of the late receipt of these orders 
by staggering its fiscal quarters to end one month after the calendar quarter end  the company is in a better position to ship these late orders and at the same time avoid additional overtime and other expediting charges 
results of operations net revenue net revenue for fiscal was higher than net revenue for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of large system products to service provider customers offset in part by lower sales of cpe systems and upgrade products and small system sales 
sales to international customers were of sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal due to increased large orders from latin america and asia 
cpe sales decreased for fiscal as compared to the prior year due to reduced orders from the company s distributors 
these reduced sales are a result of increased competition from pc based systems providers whose products compete with the company s small system products 
net revenue for fiscal was higher than net revenue for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to general expansion in the company s channels of distribution in connection with the introduction of the company s series platform  including an approximately increase in service provider business  improved performance of the company s larger distributors  and a increase in sales to customers located outside the united states which increased from million to million 
sales of the company s larger system configurations increased approximately as compared to fiscal  with smaller percentage increases in the company s smaller product configurations and system upgrades and expansions 
international sales are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
see sales and distribution for a description of certain risks associated with the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that the market for voice processing products will grow in future periods at its historical percentage rate and the company believes that the growth rates of certain domestic cpe market segments have declined from prior levels 
there is also no assurance that the company s markets will remain at current levels in future periods 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its market share in the future  or to re attain historical growth rates 
see certain trends and uncertainties 
gross margin gross margin for decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin reflects lower margins on upgrade and expansion products and customer services offset by a favorable mix of increased sales of large system products and lower provisions for retrofit obligations and inventory obsolescence 
gross margin for decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin reflects lower margins on large system products due to higher warranty and international freight costs because of increased international shipments and increased costs in the introduction of the series platform  offset in part by a favorable mix with large system products 
see certain trends and uncertainties 
research development research and development r d expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal this increase reflects higher payroll expenses resulting from higher average engineering staffing levels and increased supplies and outside services 
r d expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal this increase reflected general expansion of the company s product development programs and increases in compensation expenses due to higher headcount and depreciation 
as a percentage of net revenue  r d expenses were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that ongoing development of new products and features is required to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
the company expects to continue to invest in r d and therefore r d expenses should continue to increase  notwithstanding the level of sales realized in future quarters 
selling  general administrative selling  general administrative sg a expenses in were higher than fiscal this increase reflects primarily increases in salaries and benefits in the sales and marketing functions 
sg a expenses in represented of net revenue and were higher than such expenses for fiscal this increase was primarily related to increased sales and marketing expenses and increased compensation and travel expenses due to higher headcount  offset in part by lower litigation expenses as a percentage of net revenue  sg a expenses were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that continued investments in sales and customer support  particularly in export markets  are essential to maintaining its competitive position and that the dollar amount of sg a expenses will increase in future periods 
other expenses during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and other charges of million 
the expenses consisted of million in restructuring charges and million in expenses associated with the termination of acquisition discussions with voice tel enterprises and voice tel network voice tel 
the restructuring charges primarily represent termination benefits for approximately employees from all functions of the company and costs associated with the resignation of the company s president and chief executive officer 
the company restructured its business to align its operational expenses with its anticipated revenue levels 
as of november   million remains in accrued liabilities relating primarily to severance payments after cash payments of million 
other income and expense  net interest income on investments increased in fiscal over due to higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates 
interest income on investments increased in fiscal over because of higher average interest yields as the company shifted its short term investments from tax free state and municipal bonds to higher yielding us government and agency obligations and corporate debt securities 
fiscal included a gain on the sale of the company s text to speech business and a gain on the stock received in this asset sale for a total gain of approximately million 
fiscal included a charge of  for the company s cost of settling its stockholder class action lawsuit and certain other litigation 
provision for income taxes the company recorded income tax provision of   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and the tax provision consists of  of current foreign and domestic minimum taxes and  resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for previously recognized deferred tax assets that were no longer realizable through potentially refundable taxes 
the and income tax provisions primarily represent current foreign taxes 
no income tax benefits were recorded for the losses incurred in fiscal years and because realization of the deferred tax assets arising as a result of the loss sustained are dependent upon future taxable income  the amount and timing of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established to fully offset the deferred tax assets resulting from the losses incurred 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at november  were million  increasing million from november  at the end of fiscal and  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and million  respectively 
net cash provided from operating activities was million during fiscal trade receivables at the end of fiscal decreased million from the prior year balance primarily due to improved collection efforts and a reduction in extended payment terms to certain domestic service provider customers 
days sales outstanding computed using quarterly revenues were days at the end of fiscal compared to days at end of fiscal this decrease in dso was primarily due to the factors as noted above 
inventory levels at november  decreased million from fiscal because of reduced inventory requirements in for consignment and retrofit inventory over when the company introduced the series platform 
the company expects investment in receivables and inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company made million in capital expenditures 
a significant portion of these expenditures were related to the purchase of engineering equipment  computer equipment for all functions  as well as increased leasehold improvements 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment during fiscal on april   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby up to one million shares of its common stock may be repurchased in the open market from time to time 
during  the company purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million under this repurchase program 
the company may  depending on market conditions  purchase additional common stock in the open market during fiscal the company s principal sources of liquidity as of november  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million available under the company s bank line of credit which expires april  
the company expects to renew this bank line in fiscal this bank line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  minimum working capital  minimum tangible net worth and financial performance  and requires the bank s consent for the payment of cash dividends 
the company is in compliance with this agreement and there were no borrowings outstanding under the bank line as of november  the company presently believes  notwithstanding its accumulated deficit  that its existing cash and short term investments and credit under its line of credit will be sufficient to support the company s working capital and capital equipment purchase requirements at least through fiscal certain trends and uncertainties the company has in the past experienced and will likely in the future experience substantial fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
for instance  the company has typically experienced a slowdown in its sales levels in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
the company generally has no long term order commitments from its customers  and a significant portion of bookings and shipments in any quarter have historically occurred near the end of the quarter 
accordingly  the company has historically operated with very little backlog  and net revenue has been difficult to predict 
in addition  the portion of backlog shippable in the next quarter varies over time 
as a result  revenue in future quarters will depend largely on the level of orders received during such quarters 
the company has recently experienced an increase in the percentage of its sales from its international operations  including sales from the far east region 
in addition to the business risks associated with international operations  the recent economic turmoil has increased the uncertainty regarding future sales of the company s products in the far east region 
see sales and distribution for a description of certain risks associated with the company s international operations 
if new order bookings do not meet expected levels  or if the company experiences delays in shipments at the end of a quarter  operating results will be adversely affected  and these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of a quarter 
net revenue can also be affected by product sales mix  distribution mix  the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  customer returns and reserves provided therefor  competitive pricing pressures  the effectiveness of key distributors in selling the company s products  changes in distributor inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  regulatory approvals  and the availability of components for the company s products  each of which is difficult to predict accurately 
each of such factors has in the past affected the company s revenue 
a significant portion of the company s net revenue is attributable to a limited number of customers 
the company s top five customers  representing a combination of major distributors and service providers  accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenue in fiscal  and respectively  although the company s five largest customers were not the same in these periods 
the company has no long term order commitments from any of its customers 
any material reduction in orders from one or more such customers or the cancellation or deferral of any significant portion of backlog could have an adverse effect on net revenue and operating results 
such concentration of sales typically results in a corresponding concentration of accounts receivable 
although the company has established reserves for uncollectible accounts  the inability of any large customer to pay the company could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see risk and uncertainties note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including changes in product  distribution channel  and customer mix  cost and availability of parts and components  royalty obligations to suppliers of licensed software  provisions for warranty  retrofits  and excess and obsolete inventory  customer returns  and competitive pressures on pricing 
the company has experienced increasing competitive pricing pressure in all markets and expects this pricing pressure to continue 
further  distributors purchase products at discounts  and the company s margins can therefore vary depending upon the mix of distributor and direct sales in any particular fiscal period 
the company anticipates that its sales mix will fluctuate in future periods 
as a result of the above factors  gross margin fluctuations are difficult to predict  and gross margins may decline from current levels in future periods 
the company s future success will depend in part upon the ability of the company to continue to introduce new features and products as the company s markets evolve  new technologies become available  and customers demand additional functionality 
the company s competitors continue to add functionality to their products  and any failure by the company to introduce in a timely manner new products and features that meet customer requirements would adversely affect the company s operating results and cash flows 
the company s ability to develop such new features and products depends in large measure on its ability to hire and retain qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for such services 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successful  or that it will be able to introduce new products in a timely manner 
in this regard  the company during fiscal  announced significant new products  after experiencing delays in the introduction of such products 
moreover  customers expectations of the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors can adversely affect sales of current products 
in addition  upon the introduction of new products  the company could be subject to higher customer returns with respect to prior generations of products  which could adversely affect financial position  operating results and cash flows 
the company presently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board and subsystem assembly 
although the company has not experienced significant problems with third party manufacturers in the past  there can be no assurance that such problems will not develop in the future 
in addition  certain components used in the company s products  including certain microprocessors  line cards  power supplies  disk drives  application cards and other semiconductor devices and other components are available from sole sources 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from existing sources or  when necessary  from alternative sources of supply 
however  the inability to develop such alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole or limited source components as required  would have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results and cash flows 
in addition  the company s products are dependent on the qnx software operating system  a multitasking  real time operating system for intel microprocessor based computers 
in future periods  the company s products may become increasingly dependent on software licensed from third party suppliers 
there can be no assurance such licenses will continue to be available to the company as needed or at commercially reasonable prices 
in addition  a number of other companies  including competitors of the company  hold patents in the same general area as the technology used by the company 
the company from time to time has received  and may receive in the future  letters alleging infringement of patent rights by the company s products 
for example  in december  representatives of lucent informed the company that they believed that the company s products may infringe upon certain patents issued to lucent  and that lucent was seeking compensation for any past infringement by the company 
the company is in the process of evaluating the assertions of lucent 
lucent  or any other third party  alleging infringement  could seek an injunction prohibiting the company from selling some or all of its products  which would have an immediate  adverse impact in the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation to enjoin the company from selling its products on the basis of such alleged infringement  or that the company would be able to license any valid and infringed patents on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its internal computer systems  as well as the company s product line  to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
software programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems or the company s product line 
however  if such modifications are not made in a timely manner  the company or its customers may be unable to implement appropriate year solutions  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in recent years  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad markets fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  and general conditions in the computer and communications industries
