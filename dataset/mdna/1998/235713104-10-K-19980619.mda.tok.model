operations and acquisitions dames moore group the group operating results during fiscal were affected by increasingly competitive market conditions in its environmental business sector  by the acquisitions of complementary professional service and contracting businesses  and by the continued integration of the service capabilities of companies acquired in previous years 
the overall net revenue base of the group increased in fiscal  with attributable to acquisitions  and resulting from internal growth 
general engineering and consulting the general engineering and consulting division of the group provides environmental and specialized engineering services to private sector clients and government agencies through a worldwide network of offices 
demand for environmental services is influenced by expenditures of private sector clients and public agencies for site and environmental studies related to the construction of new facilities  remediation of contaminated sites and facilities  modernization and upgrading of existing facilities  and engineering and environmental due diligence related to acquisitions  mergers and property transfers 
specialized services provided by the general engineering and consulting division include structural and earthquake engineering  geotechnical engineering  and other services 
during fiscal  a principal factor affecting the demand for these services was the restraint on environmental spending exercised by both public sector and private sector clients 
environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies remained essentially unchanged during fiscal  and congress once again failed to act on reauthorization of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund act 
as a result  net revenues of the company s general engineering and consulting division remained virtually unchanged in the united states 
however  international net revenues continued the growth of the previous three years  increasing approximately during fiscal this sustained growth trend reflects increased worldwide demand for engineering and environmental services related to major capital investment projects and increased opportunities in developing countries 
the engineering and environmental services of the group have experienced little growth in domestic markets over the last three fiscal years 
this is due to the market conditions and regulatory factors discussed above  and to intense competition for available projects in both the private and public sector 
on the other hand  demand for services in international markets has increased  and our general engineering and consulting units operating in international markets achieved record levels of revenues and profits in fiscal profitability of international operations was enhanced by a restructuring undertaken last fiscal year  and the cost reductions and other improvements achieved will also serve to enhance international profitability in future years 
assuming that no specific action will be taken to reauthorize superfund legislation or require stricter enforcement of existing environmental regulations  the outlook for the foreseeable future is that domestic business volume of the group s general engineering and consulting division will remain relatively stable and profit margins will remain under pressure 
international business opportunities primarily in europe are expected to remain strong and to produce increased revenues and profits once again in fiscal however  the increase will likely be reduced by the continued instability in southeast asia 
in fiscal  the net revenues of dames moore group s general engineering and consulting services division constituted of the group s total net revenues  compared to of net revenues in fiscal construction services the construction services division provides program  project and construction management services for public sector projects of all sizes and complexity 
the division continued its domestic public sector work in fiscal and  as part of the group s strategic plan  was successful in expanding its services internationally and into the private sector 
a restructuring initiated last fiscal year reduced staff levels and closed some offices  and was successful in contributing to the division s increased profitability during the year 
net revenues increased by as a result of the award of several significant construction management contracts 
the division s backlog is strong  and revenues are expected to increase further during fiscal at the close of fiscal  the company acquired control of cleveland wrecking company cwc  a demolition contractor 
cwc s operations together with aman environmental construction  inc aeci now provide a full range of site demolition  decommissioning  clean up  closure and redevelopment services on a nationwide basis 
during fiscal  the net revenues for construction services were of the group s total net revenues compared to fiscal net revenues of process and chemical engineering the process and chemical engineering division provides process engineering and design services to the oil and gas  petrochemical  and pulp and paper industries  and to the federal government 
during fiscal  the division s revenues were adversely impacted by a slowdown in oil and gas drilling in the gulf of mexico  but various other developments in the petroleum and petrochemical industries produced increased business opportunities 
overall  the division s net revenues in fiscal declined slightly from fiscal profitability also declined due to retention of staff in anticipation of the start up of major projects 
initiation of these projects and other new opportunities are expected to result in increased revenues and profits in fiscal net revenues from process and chemical engineering accounted for of total group net revenues in fiscal  compared to in the proceeding year 
transportation the transportation division provides project planning  design and construction phase engineering services for transportation and infrastructure projects throughout the united states 
during fiscal  market conditions for transportation engineering services remained strong but competitive 
the division was successful in being awarded several important projects 
a direct comparison of this division s net revenues in fiscal with the previous year s net revenues is not possible since brw was acquired during the first quarter of fiscal however  partial year revenues have been essentially equivalent to those of the comparable period of the prior year 
transportation services represents of the group s net revenues in fiscal  compared to in fiscal specialty companies decisionquest dq specializes in support services for corporate clients involved in litigation 
these services include strategy consulting  development of case themes  juror analysis and selection  preparation of demonstrative trial graphics  and witness preparation 
since its acquisition in fiscal  dq has also pursued joint activities with other group companies and has completed joint projects for selected clients 
a full year to year comparison is not possible since dq was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal the company s outlook is for expanded business opportunities in fiscal and in future years 
the principal acquisition completed in fiscal was sra technologies sra  a company which provides life science services to both government agencies and private sector clients 
the company s services  which are based on biological processes  range from clinical laboratory testing to contract research analysis 
in fiscal  sra revenues were affected by funding pressures on existing government contracts and lower than anticipated revenues from clinical trials contracts 
nevertheless  the company operated profitably  and expects increased opportunity and slowly growing revenues in fiscal during the year  the company formed fourth dimension interactive  inc di  a new company  using technology developed in the general engineering and consulting division 
di develops management systems for large data bases using internet technology 
the specialty companies constituted of the group s net revenues in fiscal while net revenues were of the group s total net revenues in fiscal dames moore ventures as a means of diversifying its business interests while drawing upon the skills of the company s general engineering and consulting business  dames moore ventures dmv was established in fiscal  to make equity investments in areas related to the company s expertise 
one such investment is dames moore brookhill llc dmb  whose principal business activity is to acquire environmentally distressed properties  perform on site remediation  and develop or sell the remediated properties 
during fiscal  dmb acquired  remediated  and sold properties  and at year end continued to hold ten properties for future development and or sale 
expenses incurred during the year exceeded profits from the sale of the properties 
dmv also divested its equity interest in glencoe insurance  ltd  a company formed to offer earthquake insurance in california 
acquisitions the group companies that have been acquired in recent years provide a wide variety of engineering and specialized services 
the principal acquired companies providing construction and related services include o brien kreitzberg  aman environmental construction  inc  and cleveland wrecking company 
process and chemical engineering consists primarily of walk haydel  transportation consists primarily of brw although o brien kreitzberg also provides services to this sector and specialty businesses which are comprised of decisionquest and sra technologies 
sra was acquired in fiscal  and the other companies were acquired in previous years 
outlook in addition to the operations and acquisitions discussed above  dames moore group made several smaller acquisitions and initiated a number of internal activities during fiscal that are expected to produce increased revenues in future years 
the group s continuing investment in strategic growth initiatives  combined with the complementary services offered by newly acquired companies  new ventures  and limited restructuring of ongoing operations  should produce broader business opportunities in fiscal and the years ahead 
however  the ultimate demand for the company s services will be dependent on a continuation of economic growth in the united states and worldwide  public and private sector capital investment  enforcement of environmental regulations  and the group s ability to meet the competitive demands of the market for full service engineering  environmental  transportation  construction management  and litigation support services 
dames moore group has a worldwide network of offices located in countries 
the company is staffed by over  employees 
year the company has been evaluating and working to resolve the potential impact  if any  caused by the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s and other computerized information systems which affect the company s operations 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems and the affects of becoming year compliant is not currently expected to have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
results of operations the company uses a week fiscal year ending the last friday in march 
the fiscal years were comprised of weeks each for  and in performing its services  the company routinely incurs direct project costs for services subcontracted to third parties  equipment purchases for its clients and travel expenses 
the company is generally reimbursed by its clients for a handling fee plus the direct project costs 
in accordance with traditional practices of the engineering and consulting industry  the company deducts these costs from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues 
the company believes net revenues are a more accurate measure of revenues derived directly from the company s services

the balance of the increase is due to the write off of the remaining goodwill of a previously acquired small business  which has been discontinued  and the capitalization of additional goodwill related to contingent amounts due on previously acquired companies 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was entirely due to completed acquisitions 
increase decrease earnings from operations    the company s operating margin as a percentage of net revenues was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal adversely impacting the operating margin in fiscal is the restructuring charge and associated costs including the staffing imbalance that led up to the restructuring 
other previously mentioned administrative charges also contributed to the decline 
the company s operating margin as a percentage of net revenues would have been in fiscal without the restructuring charge 
decrease decrease investment and other income   investment and other income declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to a reduction of interest income from the interim investment of long term borrowings that was awaiting deployment to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases 
in fiscal the company acquired the majority interest in a company which it previously held a minority interest  as a result their operating results are now a part of earnings from operations 
the decline in investment and other income in fiscal as compared to fiscal is a result of the company s liquidation of the captive insurance subsidiary s equity portfolio during fiscal and the subsequent reinvestment in less volatile but lower yielding investments 
increase increase interest expense    the company has utilized borrowings to fund acquisitions  related business ventures and purchases of treasury stock  including the  shares from hochtief ag in fiscal accordingly  interest expense has increased  and it is anticipated that it will continue to increase

increase decrease net earnings    net earnings as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal and fiscal are lower than fiscal primarily due to increased interest costs and reduced income from the investment and other income  previously mentioned 
fiscal was also affected by the restructuring charge  and administrative charges previously mentioned 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents total  at march   compared to  at march  the company s working capital of  at march  has grown from  at march  the primary sources of cash during fiscal consisted of funds from operations of  and proceeds from sales of investments and other property of  the primary uses of cash in fiscal consisted of acquisitions totaling  and capital expenditures of  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal totaled  as compared to  for fiscal the most significant factor affecting this increase is the growth in accounts payable  due to a higher dollar amount for direct costs of outside services and a correlation of the payment of payables with the company s longer receivable collection cycle 
advance payments for rents  insurance and deposits somewhat offset the increase in operating cash 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal totaled  as compared to  for fiscal the decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal is attributable to several factors revenue growth provided a corresponding increase in accounts receivables  and the company settled an obligation of one of its fiscal acquisitions 
fluctuations in the deferred tax accounts further reduced cash from operating activities

investing activities reflects the company s acquisition and venture programs 
acquisitions made by the company in fiscal and fiscal have been smaller sized companies than those purchased in fiscal  and accordingly  required less cash 
in fiscal the company s venture programs reflected an investment of  for glencoe insurance  ltd  which was sold in fiscal generating proceeds of approximately  other investments in fiscal included the purchase of the bank debt of cwc and funding for dmb 
during fiscal the company s bank credit agreements were amended and the termination dates extended 
the amendments also provide more flexibility on limitations on additional indebtedness  and maintenance of certain financial ratios
