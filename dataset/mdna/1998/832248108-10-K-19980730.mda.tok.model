item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis set forth below should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
introduction the company is comprised of a meat processing group mpg and a hog production group hpg 
the mpg consists of five pork processing subsidiaries  gwaltney  john morrell  lykes  patrick cudahy  and smithfield packing 
the hpg consists of brown s and the company s interests in smithfield carroll s and circle four 
acquisitions the company has expanded through selective acquisitions of regional and multi regional meat processing companies with well recognized brand identities 
the company acquired john morrell in december and lykes in november the company s fiscal operating results include those of john morrell and lykes for the full fiscal year 
the company s fiscal operating results include those of john morrell for the full year and those of lykes for weeks 
the company s fiscal operating results include those of john morrell for weeks 
in december  the company reached an irrevocable agreement with members of the schneider family  the controlling shareholders  to purchase all of their shares in schneider corporation schneider as part of an offer by the company to acquire all of the shares of schneider 
schneider produces and markets fresh pork and a full line of processed meats in canada and had revenues in its fiscal year ended october of us million 
a lawsuit contesting the acquisition was filed by a canadian competitor and other schneider shareholders 
the court dismissed these claims  which have since been appealed 
if the company is successful in the appeals process  management anticipates that the acquisition will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal price risk management substantially all of the company s products are manufactured from commodity based raw materials  primarily live hogs 
the cost of live hogs is subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as the price of corn and soybean meal the principal feed ingredients for a hog  weather conditions  economic conditions  government regulation and other unforeseen circumstances 
the pricing of the company s fresh pork and processed meats are monitored and adjusted upward and downward in reaction to changes in the cost of the underlying raw materials 
the unpredictability of the raw material costs limit the company s ability to forward price fresh pork and processed meat products without the use of commodity contracts through a program of price risk management 
the company uses price risk management to enhance its ability to engage in forward sales contracts  where prices for future deliveries are fixed  by purchasing or selling commodity contracts for future periods to reduce or eliminate the effect of fluctuations in future raw material costs on the profitability of the related sales 
while this may tend to limit the company s ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity price fluctuations  it also tends to reduce the risk of loss from adverse changes in raw material prices 
in addition  the company utilizes commodity contracts for live hogs and corn to manage hog production margins when management determines that conditions are appropriate for such hedges 
the particular hedging methods employed and the time periods for the contracts depend on a number of factors  including the availability of adequate contracts for the respective periods for the hedges 
the company attempts to closely match the commodity contract expiration periods with the dates for product sale and delivery 
as a result  gains and losses from hedging transactions are recognized when the related sales are made and the hedges are lifted 
as of may  and april   the company had deferred million and million  respectively  of unrealized hedging gains on outstanding futures contracts 
as of may  and april   the company had open futures contracts with fair values of million and million  respectively 
as of may  and april   the company had deposits with brokers for outstanding futures contracts of million and million  respectively  included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
for open futures contracts  the company uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have on these commodity derivative instruments 
as of may   the potential change in fair value of open futures contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  was million 
operations fiscal represented weeks of operations compared to fiscal and  each of which represented weeks of operations 
accordingly  sales and all expense categories in fiscal reflect the impact of an additional week of operations compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales in fiscal were flat compared to fiscal sales reflected a increase in sales tonnage offset by a decrease in unit sales prices  reflecting the impact of lower live hog costs 
the increase in sales tonnage reflected a increase in fresh pork tonnage  a increase in processed meats tonnage and a increase in the tonnage of other products

reflecting the factors discussed above  net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  up from million  or 
per diluted share  in the prior fiscal year 
financial condition the pork processing industry is characterized by high sales tonnage and rapid turnover of inventories and accounts receivable 
because of the rapid turnover rate  the company considers its inventories and accounts receivable highly liquid and readily convertible into cash 
borrowings under the company s credit facilities are used to finance increases in the levels of inventories and accounts receivable resulting from seasonal and other market related fluctuations in raw material costs 
the demand for seasonal borrowings usually peaks in early november when ham inventories are at their highest levels  and borrowings are repaid in january when accounts receivable generated by sales of the hams are collected

maximum borrowings were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal there were no borrowings under the facility as of may  the outstanding borrowings were million as of april  at an average interest rate of 
in february  the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of year senior subordinated notes

capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal and included renovation and expansion of certain of the company s processing plants  as well as the acquisition of an idle slaughter plant in south dakota and hog production facilities in north carolina 
in addition  during fiscal  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and business of curly s foods  inc and certain of the assets and business of mohawk packing co 
for an aggregate million in cash plus million of assumed liabilities 
the capital expenditures and the business acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds 
as of may   the company had definitive commitments of million for capital expenditures primarily to increase its processed meats and value added fresh pork capacities at several of its processing plants and to replace and upgrade portions of its hardware and software in response to the year the company plans to make capital expenditures in fiscal to expand its hog production operations and to increase its processed meats business through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures  both in the united states and internationally 
this will be funded by cash flows from operations and borrowings under the million revolving credit facility 
the company s various debt agreements contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain levels and ratios for working capital  net worth  current ratio  fixed charges  capital expenditures and  among other restrictions  limit additional borrowings  the acquisition  disposition and leasing of assets  and payment of dividends to shareholders 
year management has assessed and is in the process of modifying or replacing the company s affected hardware and software and is evaluating whether external service providers  significant vendors and customers are taking the appropriate action to remedy problems associated with the year management expects to have substantially all of the systems and application changes completed by the end of fiscal may  and believes that its level of preparedness is appropriate 
management is currently in the process of quantifying the costs associated with the year  however  the ultimate costs are still not determinable 
costs are being charged to expense as incurred with the exception of hardware and software costs that are capitalizable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the costs of the project and the expected completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
