these additions did not have a material impact on the company s financial results for the year ended december  during  the company plans to fund approximately million on the development of new apartment communities and additional phases to existing apartment communities which are anticipated to provide stabilized returns on investment in the to range 
the company currently has three new apartment communities and two additional phases under development and plans to begin development on two new apartment communities in phoenix  arizona during capital expenditures for  capitalized expenditures averaged  per home for all apartment homes acquired prior to as it generally takes up to two years to complete the improvement and enhancement process at acquisitions communities  the  and acquisitions are excluded from these averages 
the company s capital expenditures include the following various exterior improvements including roofing  siding  balconies  porches  garages  carports and storage units home  various interior improvements including the upgrade program and the addition of business and fitness centers home  carpet and vinyl replacements home  various land improvements including parking lots  carports and site lighting home  security alarms  gating and fencing home  appliances home  hvac equipment home  sub metering for water and sewer home and other improvements home

in addition to the company s capital expenditures on new acquisitions  a significant portion of capital expenditures relate to an upgrade program that began in to modernize certain of the company s older apartment communities 
these upgrades primarily involve updating kitchens and bathrooms 
in addition  several initiatives which are considered revenue enhancing are underway that either allow the company to increase rents by more than the inflationary rate or allow the company to pass expenses to residents including i sub metering of water and sewer to residents where local and state regulations allow  ii gating and fencing apartment communities  iii installing monitoring devices such as intrusion alarms or controlled access devices  iv enlarging fitness centers  v adding business centers and vi constructing carports and self storage units 
as a result of the continued upgrade program and initiatives discussed above  capital expenditures increased approximately million over when the average capital expenditure per mature apartment home was the company expects capital expenditures to be at levels similar to disposition of investments real estate held for disposition the company continually undertakes portfolio review analyses with the objective of identifying communities that do not meet the company s long term investment objectives due to size  location  age  quality and or performance 
the company intends to sell of its apartment portfolio  although specific properties have not been identified as sales candidates 
generally  this will result in the disposition of many of the company s older apartment communities 
these sales will allow the company to reduce the age of its existing portfolio  which should result in lower operating expense and capital expenditure growth associated with the older communities 
management has determined that packaging communities in portfolios is more efficient and provides the greatest opportunities for disposition  and as such  the company intends to sell approximately million of communities each quarter through fiscal for a total of  to  apartment homes 
the net proceeds from these sales will be primarily used to acquire and develop newer apartment communities that will provide higher long term returns on investment than the communities that are being sold 
during  the company sold apartment communities containing  apartment homes and one shopping center for an aggregate sales price of million and received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
for financial reporting purposes  the company recognized an aggregate million gain on the sales

derivative contracts did not have a material impact on the results of operations during the twelve months ended december  and on may   an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million expired 
this interest rate swap agreement effectively changed the company s interest exposure from a variable rate to a weighted average fixed rate of on borrowings outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
no gain or loss was recognized on the expiration of this agreement 
at december   the company had five interest rate swap agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of million

the company may also fund its capital requirements through i the assumption of mortgage indebtedness  ii property sales  iii common shares sold through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  iv retained operating cash flow  v the issuance of operating partnership units and vi the use of unused credit facilities 
as a result of its investment grade debt ratings  the company expects to use unsecured debt as its primary debt funding source

the total cost of converting all internal information systems  equipment and operations for the year has not been fully quantified  but it is not expected to be a material cost to the company 
much of the company s internal software programs have been purchased from third parties 
however  no such estimates can be made as to the potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year the company is attempting to identify those risks as well as to receive compliance certificates from all third parties that have a material impact on the company s operations
