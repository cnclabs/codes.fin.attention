item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
software and hardware interfaces 
the company develops software and hardware interfaces for its adsl chipset which can be used to connect the chipset with pcs  network and central office equipment  and other telephony and data communications devices 
the interfaces are custom developed by the company for oems  who seek to incorporate the company s adsl technology into their systems 
access routers 
the company has developed and markets an adsl access router  called the x access router 
the x contains the adi aware adsl chipset along with software and hardware interfaces and designs developed by the company  and routing capability for frame relay  tcp ip  and atm data communications protocols 
in a typical configuration  the company s adsl access router is designed to receive data at speeds over mbps and send data at speeds of up to kbps  is fully rate adaptive in kbps increments and is capable of transmitting data over distances of more than  feet over standard copper wire while maintaining pots service through the use of a pots splitter 
board level products 
the company has developed and markets an adsl transceiver module  called the aw the aw is a by transceiver card  which contains the adi aware adsl chipset and software and hardware interfaces 
the aw  which is primarily sold to oems for inclusion in their adsl product offerings  also transmits and receives data at rates over mbps downstream and kbps upstream 
test and development systems 
the company has developed and markets an adsl test and development system  called the ads the ads  which is designed to help oems test their adsl systems  allows a wide range of tests  including adsl line testing and bit rate testing 
the development system houses two transceiver modules  one central office co module and one remote terminal rt module  and provides power  data  and adsl line signals to the modules 
products under development the company has publicly announced the following product development projects chipsets 
the company and adi are currently developing their next generation full rate adsl chipset 
this release includes improvements to the two asics in the chipset as well as upgrades to the signal processing software for the dsp in the chipset 
the company has announced that it is working with lucent to develop dsl lite software that will operate on lucent dsps along with analog front end chips 
the resulting chipset will be targeted at personal computer oem customers 
the company is also working with adi to develop dsl lite software that will operate on various adi chip platforms 
the resulting chipset will be primarily targeted at central office oem customers 
the company has begun in house design and development of a chip that implements the company s proprietary dwmt technology 
the resulting chip is intended to have applications in the sdsl marketplace 
the chip will be fabricated by a third party semiconductor manufacturer 
access routers and transceivers 
the company has announced that it intends to begin shipping x lite access routers that contain dsl lite functionality and aw dsl lite transceiver modules in the first half of these products  which will incorporate the second generation adi aware adsl chipset operating in dsl lite mode  will be rate adaptive and support speeds up to mbps downstream and kbps upstream and will achieve high speed data transfer over local loops of up to  feet 
image compression in  the company began an effort to produce commercially marketable wavelet image compression software products 
the company currently offers five software based compression products and has an agreement with adi to produce and market a wavelet video compression asic  for which the company receives royalties 
the company s compression products include the following wsq by aware which compresses digital fingerprint data for use by law enforcement agencies  such as the fbi  accupress for radiology which is used to compress digital radiographs and other types of medical imagery  accupress for multimedia which is a general purpose compression product  accupress for remote sensing which is designed for compression of satellite based remote sensing imagery  and seispact which companies in the oil and gas industry can use to store and transmit large amounts of seismic data 
technology the company s core technology is based on its research into wavelet mathematics  digital communications  and data compression 
from that core technology  four principal technologies have emerged  including i dmt based adsl technology  ii splitterless dmt dsl lite technology  iii dwmt technology  and iv image compression technology 
adsl technology adsl is a method for expanding the useable bandwidth of copper wire 
typically  adsl systems divide a one megahertz mhz bandwidth on copper wire into three segments i the to kilohertz khz range is used for pots  ii the khz to khz range is used to transmit data upstream and iii the khz to mhz range is used to transmit information downstream 
the ansi specification for adsl calls for operation rates of to mbps downstream and to kbps upstream when operating over existing copper wires at a distance of up to  feet 
there are two primary adsl modulation techniques for transmitting data signals i dmt  which the company uses  and ii cap 
dmt is a multi carrier modulation technique that was chosen by ansi as the telecommunications industry standard for adsl 
cap is a single carrier modulation technique originally developed by at t paradyne corporation now globespan technologies  inc 
the fundamental difference between cap and dmt is that cap treats each of the upstream and downstream frequency ranges as a single element over which as many information bits as possible are transmitted 
in contrast  dmt divides the upstream and downstream bands into groups of different smaller subchannel frequency ranges approximately khz each into which a much smaller number of bits are coded and transmitted simultaneously 
the company believes that dmt technology is better able than cap technology to address the inherent problems of the telcos copper wire networks 
because of its multiple small frequency bands  dmt is able to adjust and adapt the information signal to both extract more throughput from a wire and to avoid sending information into frequency ranges that are not useable 
since cap treats the entire frequency range as a single element  it does not have the ability to balance as easily the use of the frequency spectrum to match efficiently the performance of a given wire 
splitterless dmt dsl lite technology in  the company helped to pioneer a new form of xdsl technology  known as splitterless dmt dsl lite technology 
dsl lite allows for downstream data transmissions over telephone networks in the to mbps range  and upstream data transmissions of up to kbps in a splitterless environment 
splitterless means that modems employing this technology do not require special equipment  known as pots splitters  to separate the telephone service from the data service 
the omission of a pots splitter vastly reduces the installation cost of dsl lite service over that of adsl service by removing the need to send a technician for service installation 
further  this technology will enable end users to install dsl lite modems in the same way as today s voiceband modems 
for these reasons  the company believes that dsl lite technology may act as a catalyst to increase the speed at which service providers deploy xdsl technologies 
dmt operating in a splitterless dsl lite mode has been endorsed by both the uawg and the itu for two primary reasons i dmt dsl lite can be made to interoperate with full rate dmt based adsl  the ansi standard for adsl modulation  and ii dmt dsl lite equipment and software provide a clear migration path to full rate standards based adsl central office and customer premises equipment 
the uawg intends to submit a specification for splitterless dmt dsl lite to the itu in while predicting the timing or outcome of standard body actions is difficult  the itu has preliminarily indicated that it will attempt to adopt a standard for this technology by the end of dwmt technology the company has invented a proprietary technology based on wavelet mathematics called dwmt 
the company believes that  as a result of its research and development of dwmt technology  it is a leader in commercialization of wavelets for telecommunications 
multi carrier systems divide a frequency range into the desired number of subchannels by using a time domain to frequency domain transform  which is a mathematical process 
because of fundamental limits associated with such transforms  the process of creating isolated subchannels is imperfect 
these imperfections inhibit modems from achieving theoretical performance limits 
the subchannelization method used in creating dmt modems utilizes a fourier transform 
this technique has been used in the telecommunications industry since the s  but has become more practical for high speed  high volume use as digital signal processors have improved 
the wavelet transform yields significantly better subchannelization than the fourier transform 
because this technique more closely approximates ideal subchannelization  the performance of a wavelet based dwmt system can produce performance superior to a non wavelet dmt system operating in a noisy environment 
the company intends to apply dwmt technology to new products using sdsl  vdsl  and hfc applications 
the company is seeking to incorporate dwmt techniques into industry standards body recommendations 
the following is a brief description of possible applications using sdsl  vdsl  and hfc sdsl 
symmetric digital subscriber line technology is similar to adsl  but allows two way data transmission at the same rates 
the company is developing an sdsl application using its dwmt technology 
sdsl is not an officially defined standard  but can provide data transmission rates from mbps to mbps simultaneously in both directions on single twisted pair copper wire over distances of  to  feet 
the company expects that this sdsl application can be used for lan interconnecting and enhanced telephony applications 
vdsl 
the company believes that very high speed digital subscriber line technology will be the next generation of high speed user access  critical to the implementation of fiber to the neighborhood and fiber to the curb architectures 
these architectures involve the deployment of an access node that utilizes fiber optic cable from a telco s central office to the access node  thus bringing fiber closer to the user 
the final connection to the user is new or existing copper wire or new coaxial cable 
vdsl is being designed with the objective of providing performance up to six times faster than adsl  but over a shorter distance 
the goal of vdsl is to enable telcos to provide a combination of digital tv  data dial tone and regular telephony service on a single twisted pair of copper wire 
hfc 
by using the frequency band from to mhz for upstream transmission and the frequency band from to mhz for downstream transmission  it is possible to provide two way services  such as telephony and data communications  on existing hfc networks 
each of these frequency bands is typically divided into smaller bands  to mhz wide 
the company s hfc technology is based upon dwmt and can provide up to mbps transmission over a mhz band 
hfc telephony and cable modem technology enables cable companies to re use their existing network to provide two way data transmission services 
image compression technology since  the company has developed expertise  trade secrets  and intellectual property in the field of wavelet transform based data compression and has obtained several patents in this area 
the company s wavelet compression technology enables digital image  video and certain types of data to be compressed to between and of their original size 
using wavelet compression  the decompressed data are not bit for bit identical to the original data 
a risk with this technique is that  as the original data get smaller  a larger amount of error is introduced into the decompressed data 
however  compressed data can be transmitted across networks faster and storage costs are reduced 
research and development the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to adapt to the rapidly changing telecommunications environment and to meet its customers needs 
the timely development and introduction of new products is essential to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company s product development activities are focused on delivering technology and products to its oem customers that will enable them to offer end to end systems that will allow their service provider customers to make maximum use of the capabilities of their existing copper wire networks 
key development objectives include enhancements to the company s adsl and dsl lite technologies as well as on products incorporating dwmt technology for sdsl and vdsl applications 
in and  the company spent approximately  on the development of its hfc technology 
in the third quarter of  the company suspended development of its hfc technology due to a lack of customer demand for such technology at that time 
the company may recommence hfc development activities if and when there is sufficient customer demand 
most of the company s products are developed internally 
as of december   the company had a research and development staff of employees  including ten employees holding doctorate degrees related to digital signal processing and digital communications theory 
the company supplemented its staff of engineering employees with additional contract engineers at december  subject to its ability to effectively source  hire and retain engineers  the company anticipates that its research and development organization will grow significantly in the future as the company attempts to strengthen its technology and product position in the telecommunications marketplace 
during the years ended december   and  research and development costs charged to operations were   and  respectively 
such costs are net of software development costs capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
there were no sfas costs capitalized in  or new product development schedules are difficult to predict  because telecommunications product development  quality assurance testing and debugging are complex processes that often take longer than expected 
accordingly  although the company estimates the shipment dates of proposed new products for internal purposes  such estimates are subject to frequent adjustment based on the company s own periodic assessment of its progress in the development process 
no assurance can be given that any of the development projects referred to in the products and markets section will be successful or that any announced shipping dates for new products will be met 
sales and marketing to date  the company s principal telecommunications sales and marketing strategy has been to propagate its technology and products with oem equipment suppliers 
these oem customers manufacture and sell telephone network equipment  cable plant equipment  data communications equipment  and end user customer premises equipment 
the company s objective is to incorporate its technology and products into solutions offered by its oem customers 
the company has three types of oem customers with whom it has business relationships i licensees of intellectual property  such as us robotics com  ii semiconductor manufacturing partners  such as adi and lucent  and iii customers who purchase the company s existing telecommunications products  such as advanced fibre communications  dsc communications  ericsson  siemens  adc  phillips  eci  sumitomo  and pulsecom 
due to the complexity of the company s telecommunications technology  the company s sales people must have a high degree of technical sophistication in order to market its products effectively 
the company believes that technology selections involving the company s products are frequently made at senior levels within a prospective customer s organization 
consequently  the company relies significantly on presentations by senior management to key employees of oems 
as of december   the company had ten people in its telecommunications sales and marketing organization 
although the company s primary sales and marketing objective is to sell to oem s  during the company began selling its adsl products to resellers  internet service providers and competitive local access providers 
as xdsl technologies are more broadly adopted  the company expects to hire additional sales and marketing employees to support the efforts of senior management with its oem customers and to create awareness for the company s products and technology with its oems service provider customers 
the company sells its software based compression products primarily through oems and systems integrators 
as of december   there were three people in the company s compression software sales organization 
the company has in the past and expects in the future to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from a limited number of customers 
there are relatively few oem equipment suppliers to whom the company can sell its technology and products 
consequently  the company s future success will depend to a large extent upon i the timing and size of future purchase orders for the company s products from these customers  ii the financial and operating success of these customers  and iii the success of products offered by these customers that use the company s technology and products 
any attempt by such customers to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake the internal development and sale of technology and products comparable to those of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
the company derived approximately   and of its total revenue in from us robotics com  the united states government and adi  respectively 
the company derived approximately    and of its total revenue in from dsc communications corporation  adi  the united states government  and teltrend  inc  respectively 
the company derived approximately    and of its total revenue in from adi  general instrument corporation  the united states government  and gss array technology  respectively 
predominately all revenue in   and was sold to unaffiliated customers in north america 
manufacturing the company s manufacturing capacity is relatively limited and as such it relies on a third party contractor manufacturer to assemble and test substantially all of its xdsl products 
the company s third party manufacturer is located in canada  and obtains component parts directly from the company  and from suppliers chosen by the company or itself 
other than the adsl chipset  which is available through adi  the company believes that other components for its products are available from a number of suppliers 
further  the company believes that other qualified third party contract manufacturers exist to assemble and test the company s products in the event its relationship with its current contract manufacturer is not successful 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
competition the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and the company expects competition to increase in the immediate future  especially in the emerging adsl and dsl lite market 
the company intends to compete on the basis of technology  price  the timing of product delivery  product features  quality  reliability  and customer satisfaction 
the company currently competes  or expects to compete in the future  with the following categories of companies i other vendors of dmt based adsl technology  such as orckit communications limited orckit  amati communications corporation texas instruments inc amati ti  pairgain technologies  inc pairgain and alcatel network systems  inc alcatel  ii vendors of alternative adsl technologies  such as globespan technologies  inc globespan  which is currently marketing its cap based adsl technology  iii oems and other systems integrators  such as ericsson  northern telecommunications  westell  cisco  com  and pairgain  and iv regional bell operating companies rbocs and other telcos  who are no longer prohibited from manufacturing telecommunications equipment as a result of deregulation the company s success will depend on telcos willingness to invest in broadband digital services based on xdsl technologies 
the company expects that its xdsl technology and products will compete not only with other products that increase the efficiency of digital transmission technologies over copper wire  such as isdn for internet access  but also with other broadband transmission technologies  such as hfc  fiber optic cable  digital broadcast satellite and other wireless technologies 
the company believes its current and future broadband products will permit telcos to upgrade their networks in a flexible and cost effective way  but telcos may choose to deploy products using better established technologies to upgrade their networks including fiber optic cable  which many telcos favor 
to the extent that telcos choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media between central offices and end users  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that  in the adsl market  its dmt based products are more flexible and will enjoy greater potential for deployment than products using the cap technique  which is a non standard  proprietary  single source technology 
however  cap based adsl products were introduced prior to the company s products and are more readily available than the company s products 
to date  there has been only limited commercial deployment of the company s competitors dmt based adsl products 
therefore  the company is uncertain how its products will compare with products sold by alcatel  amati ti  orckit and pairgain  each of whom manufactures dmt based adsl products 
each of these competitors have made claims in their sales literature and elsewhere suggesting that their products provide data transmission rates that are equal to or faster than that of the company s products 
however  the company does not have access to these products  and therefore has no independent means by which it can corroborate these claims 
the markets for the company s wavelet image compression technology are competitive  and are expected to become increasingly so in the near future 
in addition  the company s wsq finger print compression product is an implementation of an open standard and is therefore subject to competition 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors  including the rbocs  alcatel  and amati ti have significantly greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results 
intellectual property in the field of telecommunications technology  the company holds eight patents for applying wavelet mathematics to communications systems 
the company has two pending patent applications that pertain to the application of multi carrier technology to broadband communications 
the company has also filed multiple provisional patents that pertain to its splitterless dsl techniques 
the company also holds six patents for image compression and processing  three patents for video compression  one patent for audio compression  one patent for certain optical applications and one pending patent for seismic data compression 
although the company has patented certain aspects of its technology  the company relies primarily on know how and trade secrets to protect its intellectual property 
the company attempts to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with its customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through security measures 
each of the company s employees is required to sign a nondisclosure and non competition agreement 
although the company intends to protect its rights vigorously  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which products incorporating the company s technology may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
while the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property  the company believes that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry  its technical expertise and ability to introduce new products on a timely basis will be more important in maintaining its competitive position than protection of its existing intellectual property and that patent  trade secret and copyright protections are important but must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge  ability and experience of the company s personnel  new technology and products  and product enhancements 
although the company continues to implement protective measures and intends to defend vigorously its intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
many participants in the telecommunications industry have an increasing number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
if the company is found to have infringed any of such patents  the company could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing it from conducting its business  and the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
the company may also receive notices from third parties regarding the pendency of various patent applications which may be pertinent to the design and operation of xdsl telecommunications equipment 
unless and until patents actually issue  there can be no infringement  and the company has not examined any such patent applications 
although third parties may offer to license their patents and their patent applications to the company  there can be no assurance that any license would be available on acceptable terms should the company choose to pursue such license or be found to infringe such patents 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that these assertions will not result in protracted and costly litigation  or that the company would prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
further  such litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by the company 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

employees at december   the company employed people  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in manufacturing  and in finance  information systems and administration 
all of these employees were based in massachusetts 
as necessary  the company supplements its regular employees with temporary and contract personnel 
at december   the company had engaged temporary and contract personnel primarily working in research and development 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on the continued service of its technical and senior management personnel and upon the company s continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing  and managerial personnel 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key managerial and technical employees or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future
