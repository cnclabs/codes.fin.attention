item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview in  the transformation of the company continued 
progress was made in a number of growth areas and new products were introduced 
the company continued the realignment of its operating organization to continue to position the company for sustained long term growth 
the overall goal of the effort is to provide greater focus on the end use customer by consolidating divisions around common technology  manufacturing processes and markets 
as part of this program  since november all division managers report directly to corporate  eliminating a management layer 
the company is entering with fifteen operating divisions compared to forty operating divisions in the realignment includes the divestiture of businesses serving markets that do not meet our growth criteria or strategic direction 
the resulting gains from these divestitures in allowed the company to fund improvements and accelerate investments in its remaining divisions  which included planned costs in connection with the consolidation and restructuring initiatives 
in  the company will use the proceeds from two divestitures to accelerate some consolidation programs  invest in acquisitions in strategic growth areas and replace the revenue lost through divestitures  invest in information technology  and continue the stock purchase program 
the withdrawal from the department of energy doe support business was finalized during as the last contract expired 
during  the company formed an exclusive partnership with ge medical systems to manufacture a first of its kind filmless multipurpose digital x ray detector for high end medical applications 
new medical products were introduced in  and automotive testing services were expanded 
compared to sales from continuing operations increased in compared to excluding the effects of currency translation and completed divestitures  sales increased 
operating income from continuing operations was million in and included a million non cash asset impairment charge  primarily associated with the ic sensors business 
the after tax effect of this charge was million 
loss per share 
excluding the asset impairment charge  operating income in was million  approximately equal to the prior year 
the operating income included gains of million from the divestitures of businesses in the instruments and mechanical components segments 
these gains were offset by planned costs of million incurred in connection with the consolidation and restructuring initiatives and a charge of million resulting from a cash deficit in an employee benefit plan 
the gains and costs were included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million over the level 
compared to sales from continuing operations increased in compared to  reflecting a growth in product sales of and a decrease in technical services sales 
operating income from continuing operations increased in compared to the improvement reflected the impact of higher sales in the instruments and mechanical components segments and lower costs resulting from the company s restructuring plan 
partially offsetting these increases in operating income were decreases in optoelectronics caused by significant operational problems resulting in a loss in the micromachined sensors business and decreases in technical services caused by lower automotive testing services and the completion of two contracts in cost savings under the restructuring plan totaled million in  which represents an million increase over the savings achieved in capital expenditures increased in to million  and outlays for research and development were million 
the company s program to reduce working capital and to dispose of nonstrategic assets continued in with cumulative reductions of over million since its inception in key measures of effectiveness of working capital management  days sales outstanding and inventory turns  improved by and  respectively  in results of operations the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the major changes by industry segment 
instruments compared to instruments sales decreased million 
excluding the effects of the stronger us dollar on us dollar denominated sales million currency translation and the divestiture of two businesses million  sales increased million 
the increase was mainly due to sales of a new medical research instrument and consumables related to the placement of an increasing number of diagnostic instruments 
these increases were partially offset by decreases caused by reduced european government funding in the research area and delays in product improvements 
operating income decreased million 
the instruments results included gains of million on the divestiture of two businesses and a million net reduction in patent infringement costs 
these increases were partially offset by restructuring and integration costs of million  the absence of income million from the expiration of a grant liability in and loss of divested businesses income of million 
excluding these items  instruments income decreased million as a result of start up costs and difficulties resulting from geographic expansion of medical distribution organizations  price reductions due to continued competitive pressure on conventional explosives detection systems and lower sales experienced by some businesses 
these decreases were partially offset by the income earned on the higher sales of medical research instruments and consumables 
the berthold business  while profitable  performed below expectations and its progress is being reviewed 
compared to the million sales increase resulted mainly from higher demand for explosives detection systems  primarily from us government facilities  and from diagnostic and medical research products 
these increases were partially offset by decreases totaling million  which resulted from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of two product lines in operating income was of sales in compared to in operating income increased million  primarily from improved margins on higher sales 
also contributing  to a lesser extent  were manufacturing and engineering process improvements  lower costs resulting from the restructuring plan  lower inventory provisions due to improved inventory management  the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  income from the expiration of a grant liability and a provision for additional cost reductions 
a million provision for a patent infringement settlement and increased management incentive accruals partially offset these increases 
as a part of the settlement  the company entered into a royalty agreement covering future sales 
mechanical components compared to sales increased million due to higher demand for aerospace products  reflecting continued strength in that market  new products and higher demand for electromechanical products 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales resulting from the divestiture of a business 
income increased million as the result of the gain of million on the divestiture  income on higher sales and improved contract margin 
these increases were partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation and relocation of manufacturing facilities and warranty costs 
the ducting business  while profitable  continued to perform below expectations 
as part of its strategy to focus resources upon larger business units better positioned to take advantage of growing demand  the company sold its rotron division in january for million 
rotron s sales were million and its operating income was million 
earnings per share 
in december of  the company entered into an agreement to sell its sealol industrial seals division to ti group  plc 
for million  while simultaneously purchasing ti group s belfab division for million 
belfab s sales were million 
subject to regulatory and other approvals  these transactions are expected to close in the first half of sealol industrial seals division s sales were million and its operating income was million 
earnings per share 
the company expects to realize after tax gains of approximately million from these divestitures 
compared to higher demand for aerospace  electromechanical and industrial process sealing products resulted in sales growth 
the increase in operating income resulted from the margin on higher sales and lower costs from the restructuring plan  partially offset by provisions for projected excess contract costs and warranty repairs 
optoelectronics compared to sales decreased million due to loss of market share to a competitor s lower cost automotive accelerometers  the effects of currency translation and the completion of contracts in in the camera and power supplies businesses 
these decreases were partially offset by the sales resulting from the introduction of new thermopile products 
the million decrease in income resulted primarily from the non cash asset impairment charge of million 
excluding the impairment charge  operating income decreased million as a result of lower sales  higher operating losses at ic sensors and higher development costs for the advanced micromachined sensors technology 
products incorporating the advanced micromachined sensors technology have been delivered to key customers for evaluation 
market acceptance and technical feasibility are expected to be determined in the first quarter of the cost of the development effort for the amorphous silicon project continued at the million level  while the development effort for the advanced micromachined sensor technology cost million 
ic sensors asset impairment charge as a result of ic sensors inability to achieve the improvements specified in its corrective action plan including new product orders  improved manufacturing yields  cost reductions and attraction and retention of critical personnel  it continued operating at a loss in the second quarter of  triggering an impairment review of its long lived assets 
a revised operating plan was developed to restructure and stabilize the business 
the revised projections by product line provided the basis for measurement of the asset impairment charge 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter for a write down of goodwill of million and fixed assets of million 
the after tax effect of this charge was million 
loss per share 
the impairment charge reduces future depreciation and amortization by approximately million annually 
for  ic sensors lost million  excluding the asset impairment charge 
ic sensors performance in the second half of was consistent with its revised operating plan 
the company continues to evaluate performance against the revised operating plan and will continue to monitor the realizability of the remaining assets if the operation fails to meet this plan 
compared to sales of new imaging products and higher demand for detectors and accelerometers for the automotive market  partially offset by decreases caused by lower power supplies sales and the divestiture of a product line in  resulted in an increase of million 
operating income decreased million as significant operational problems resulted in a loss in the micromachined sensors business  which had sales of million 
to a lesser extent  lower sales and projected excess contract costs in the power supplies business contributed to the decrease 
partially offsetting these decreases were the margin on the sales of new imaging products and lower costs resulting from the restructuring plan 
the impact of the development effort for the amorphous silicon project continued at the million level 
technical services compared to sales increased million  primarily reflecting final shipments under a contract for the development and installation of communication systems million  higher automotive testing sales million due primarily to the start up of the new light truck structural testing facility  and higher billings under government contracts 
after a goodwill write down of million related to the environmental services business  operating income increased million 
excluding the goodwill write down  operating income increased million primarily due to higher sales levels 
future performance could be affected by the nasa and air force decision to consolidate and recompete the base operations contracts at the kennedy space center  cape canaveral air station and certain functions at patrick air force base in an effort to eliminate duplication and reduce costs 
it is anticipated that the resultant contract would be effective october  the company is participating in the recompetition for the new contract as part of a joint venture with johnson controls 
the nasa contract at the kennedy space center contributed sales of million in compared to the million sales reduction was mainly the result of the absence in of the billings under two large contracts 
also contributing to the reduction was a decrease in sales of the automotive operations  primarily due to continuing lower demand for stationary testing services caused by customers budget constraints and mature testing specifications  and completion of a lubricant testing contract at the end of the first quarter of the million operating income reduction was the result of the sales reductions  partially offset by the recognition of a productivity incentive fee on the kennedy space center contract and the estimated provision for a legal judgment 
general corporate expenses compared to the million increase was primarily due to a million charge resulting from a cash deficit in an employee benefit plan  million in costs associated with restructuring and realignment  and costs of new program initiatives 
compared to the million decrease was primarily due to lower costs resulting from the restructuring plan and management incentive accruals 
other compared to the million net decrease in other expense was mainly due to a million reimbursement relating to a joint development program  which was partially offset by lower interest income 
the effective tax rate of was significantly affected by the non deductible goodwill write down of ic sensors and the environmental services divisions 
excluding the impairment charge  the effective tax rate for was compared to in the increase in the rate was primarily due to changes in the geographical distribution of income 
the effective tax rate may increase to approximately as a result of changes in the geographical distribution of income due to divestitures 
compared to the million net increase in other expense was due to higher interest expense reflecting the issuance of million of ten year notes in october and lower gains on the disposition of nonstrategic assets 
the effective tax rate of for was lower than the rate in primarily due to changes in the geographical distribution of income 
discontinued operations compared to the decrease in income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  reflected the expiration in september of the mound contract  which was the company s last management and operations contract with the doe 
the company is in the process of negotiating contract closeouts and does not anticipate incurring a material loss in excess of previously established reserves 
compared to the decrease in income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  reflected the expiration of the rocky flats and nevada test site contracts in environmental the company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company locations and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites

as of december   the company had an accrual of million to reflect its estimated liability for environmental remediation 
as assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred  the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
during  the company adopted the provisions of statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
its adoption did not have a material effect on results of operations 
financial condition the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million in while commercial paper borrowings increased million 
net cash provided by continuing operations was million in  million in and million in the net cash provided by continuing operations was lower in compared to primarily as a result of a greater increase in accounts receivable and higher funding of the us pension and postretirement medical benefit plans 
the accounts receivable increase was mainly the result of higher sales across all segments
