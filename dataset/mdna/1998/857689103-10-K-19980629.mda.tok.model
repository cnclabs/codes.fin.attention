charles and station casino kansas city 
b ebitda  as adjusted consists of operating income plus depreciation  amortization  preopening expenses and a one time restructuring charge in ebitdar  as adjusted represents ebitda  as adjusted plus rent expense 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  ebitda  as adjusted and ebitdar  as adjusted are useful financial performance measurements for assessing the operating performance of the company 
together with net income and cash flows  ebitda  as adjusted and ebitdar  as adjusted provide investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service debt and incur capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebitda  as adjusted and ebitdar  as adjusted and the trends they depict  the components of each should be considered 
the impact of interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  preopening expenses  a one time restructuring charge in and rent expense  each of which can significantly affect the company s results of operations and liquidity and should be considered in evaluating the company s operating performance  cannot be determined from ebitda  as adjusted or from ebitdar  as adjusted 
further  ebitda  as adjusted and ebitdar  as adjusted do not represent net income or cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and do not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
they should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  it should be noted that not all gaming companies that report ebitda or ebitdar information or adjustments to such measures may calculate ebitda  ebitdar or such adjustments in the same manner as the company  and therefore  the company s measures of ebitda  as adjusted and ebitdar  as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other gaming companies
