item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview during  the company completed a major step in its transformation into an operating company through the purchase in january of the of general physics corporation general physics that it did not previously own see note to the consolidated financial statements 
general physics  with over employees located in offices worldwide  provides training and performance improvement services to fortune companies  manufacturing and process industries  electric power utilities  and other commercial and governmental customers 
on march   the company changed its name from national patent development corporation to gp strategies corporation 
the name change reflects the company s plan to focus its efforts on general physics and to concentrate on strategically growing general physics business both domestically and internationally 
in  general physics experienced significant increases in sales and operating profit  fueled primarily by the continued growth of their commercial business 
in  income before income taxes  discontinued operation and extraordinary item was  as compared to  in the reduced income in is due to certain non recurring events in  partially mitigated by increased operating profits generated by all three operating groups of the company 
in the company recognized a  gain on the sale of  shares of gts duratek  inc duratek common stock  a  gain on the transfer of  shares of duratek common stock from long term investments to trading securities and a  gain recognized on the issuance of stock by affiliates 
these gains in were partially offset by a  loss recognized on the company s investment in american white cross  inc awc 
in  the company recognized a  net gain on trading securities related to duratek 
the gain is the result of an  gain on the transfer from long term investments to trading securities  partially offset by a  loss on the sale of duratek common stock 
the physical science group  which is primarily general physics  achieved a  increase in operating profits or in as a result of increased sales and gross margin  and the ability of general physics to maintain their general and administrative expenses at the same level  even though sales increased by

in  the company had increased sales within the physical science  distribution and optical plastics groups 
the physical science group s sales increased from  in to  in and to  in the increased sales of  in were the result of increased sales within general physics workforce development and training group and applied technology group  partially mitigated by reduced sales within the facility and process technology group 
the increased sales of  in were primarily the result of increased sales within general physics workforce development and training group  as well as to a lesser extent  increased sales within both its facility and process technology and applied technology groups 
the increased sales within all groups of general physics during is the result of the continuing focus of general physics marketing efforts to expand its range of performance improvement services to fortune companies  manufacturing and process industries  as well as electric power utilities and other commercial and governmental customers 
the distribution group sales increased from  in to  in and to  in the increased sales of  in were the result of five star commencing sales to a major retail chain  as well as a significant growth in sales to independent retail stores 
the growth in independent retail store sales was primarily generated by a significant increase in sales of hardware products due to an expansion of five star s product line 
the sales increase in was partially mitigated by the closing of two retail chains in the northeast which had generated  of sales in the increased sales of  in were the result of the continued growth of five star s sales to independent retail stores due to the continued growth of five star s hardware related business  as well as increased regional marketing efforts 
in september  a major retail chain  which generated sales of  and  in and  respectively  ceased operations 
five star plans to replace the majority of this sales volume in with both new customers  as well as increased sales within its existing customer base 
for the first quarter of  five star s sales are expected to be at approximately the same level as for the first quarter of  in spite of the loss of the major retail chain which had sales in excess of  during the first three months of the optical plastics group sales decreased from  in to  in and increased to  in the reduced sales of  in were the result of reduced orders from mxl s largest customer  due to changes in their product line 
the increased sales of  in were primarily the result of sales generated from new customers as well as increased sales from mxl s existing customers 
in  sales from mxl s largest customer remained approximately the same as in  therefore reducing mxl s reliance on this customer 
gross margin consolidated gross margin was  or in   or in and  or of net sales in the increased gross margin of  in was the result of increased gross margin within the physical science and distribution groups  partially offset by reduced gross margin achieved by the optical plastics group 
the increased gross margin achieved in of  in was the result of increased gross margins achieved within all operating groups of the company 
the physical science group gross margin increased from  or of net sales in to  or of net sales in and to  or of net sales in in  the increased gross margin of  was the result of increased sales as well as reduced overhead costs as a percentage of sales 
in  the increased gross margin of  was the result of increased sales as well as an increased gross margin percentage 
the increased gross margin percentage is the result of increased sales within general physics commercial business  which historically achieves higher gross margin percentages than the government 
the increased gross margin dollars and percentage was achieved in despite investments by general physics in the enterprise wide software end user training market and international markets  which led to negative gross margins totaling approximately  in addition  in general physics made a significant investment in business development in their existing market sectors  which had the effect of reducing gross margin dollars and percentages during the year 
the company believes that these investments are an integral part of its overall strategy of expanding into new markets and businesses  and are evaluated on a continuing basis

the optical plastics group gross margin decreased from  or of net sales in to  or of net sales in and increased to  or of net sales in the reduced gross margin of  as well as the reduced gross margin percentage in was the result of reduced sales to mxl s major customer  who historically generated higher gross margin percentages than the remainder of mxl s business on average 
in the increased gross margin was the result of increased sales 
investment and other income  net investment and other income  net was  in   in and  in the reduced investment and other income in is primarily due to a  loss recognized on the company s investment in gses in  as compared to income of  recognized on the company s equity investment in gses in the loss on the company s equity investment in gses was partially mitigated by increased consulting revenue earned by the american drug company adc  the company s owned subsidiary  in due to the receipt of a success fee related to a consulting project 
in addition  five star earned increased marketing income in due to increased sales as well as implementation of new marketing programs 
the improvement in is primarily due to three factors

the increased costs incurred within the distribution group were the result of increased sales commissions incurred by five star due to increased sales  as well as increased reserves taken for uncollectable accounts due to the bankruptcy and the subsequent ceasing of operations of a major retail chain in the fourth quarter of the physical science and optical plastics groups experienced marginal increases in sg a in  due to general physics and mxl s ability to increase sales while maintaining the same overhead structure as in the increase of  in sg a in was the result of increased sg a incurred by the distribution group  partially offset by reduced sg a achieved by the physical science and optical plastics groups and at the corporate level 
the increased sg a within the distribution group was primarily the result of increased sales commissions paid due to increased sales  as well as increased costs incurred by five star for equipment and computer rental due to the continued upgrading and development of their facility management systems 
the reduced sg a achieved by general physics was the result of the  reserve taken in related to potentially uncollectible revenue recorded in years prior to december   partially offset by a  reserve recorded in for the settlement of a legal action brought against general physics by a former employee 
the optical plastics group achieved lower sg a in due to efforts to reduce their operating costs due to their reduced sales volume

the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test systems for year compliance 
it is anticipated that the project will be completed by the middle of management has not yet assessed the year compliance expense and related potential effect on the company s earnings 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
