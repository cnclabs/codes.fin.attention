item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was formed to develop and market technologies that enable financial institutions and other businesses to provide consumer financial services electronically with reduced or no human intervention 
from the period of inception january  through december   the company was a development stage company  and its activities principally related to developing its decisys rt technology formerly known as the dss system and the affinity automated loan machine alm  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
during  and early the company s primary products and services consisted of the alm and a call center decisioning system that provided financial institutions the ability to originate unsecured consumer loans with little or no human intervention 
during this period  the company s customers primarily utilized the alm delivery channel which captures origination information for unsecured consumer loan applications and then routes this information to the company s proprietary decisys rt for an automated decision 
also during this period the company continued to develop additional financial products which could be originated at an alm and processed through decisys rt 
these products included loans secured by cash collateral  and the functions necessary to open checking accounts  renew existing loans  cross sell other products and make counter offers to applicants who qualify for a loan amount higher or lower than the loan originally requested 
during the company continued its channel and product development to enable the automated decisioning  processing and fulfillment of financial product transactions by decisys rt originating through not only alms  but also other non alm channels  including call centers  branches  and automobile dealerships 
the company s system includes inherent architecture that enables integration of origination  processing and fulfillment across a wide range of interface channels with the consumer 
a significant new channel system developed in is e xpertlender 
e xpertlender is the company s system that establishes connectivity among all of a financial institution s delivery channels  its automated decisioning system  and its risk management group 
e xpertlender also  upon approval  gives the consumer a choice of closing methods that include branches  alms  mail  and third party closing agents 
the system enables call center agents and branch personnel to inquire as to the status of applications at anytime and electronically notifies loan officers with respect to exceptions and the reason for referral 
e xpertlender replaced the company s call center decisioning system assets previously developed under a joint venture agreement with union planters corporation 
the company no longer markets the assets system 
additionally  the joint venture agreement was terminated in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies minority interest 
to date  the company has generated minimal operating revenues  has incurred significant losses and has experienced substantial negative cash flow from operations 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly technology based companies operating in unproven markets with unproven products 
the company had an accumulated deficit as of december  of  with operating losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs to develop its financial product origination capabilities  to enhance and market the alm  e xpertlender and decisys rt and to complete any new products and services that may be developed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will ever be able to achieve profitability or  if achieved  sustain such profitability 
the market for the company s products and services is new  evolving and uncertain  and it is difficult to determine the size and predict the future growth rate  if any  of this market 
in addition  the market for products and services that enable electronic commerce is highly competitive and is subject to rapid innovation and competition from traditional products and services having all or some of the same features as products and services enabling electronic commerce 
competitors in this market have frequently taken different strategic approaches and have launched substantially different products or services in order to exploit the same perceived market opportunity 
until the market has validated a strategy through widespread acceptance of a product or service  it is difficult to identify all current or potential market participants or gauge their relative competitive position 
revenue and expense recognition the company s alm pricing structure is designed to recapture a portion of the company s costs through set up and lease fees and to generate over the long term a greater portion of revenues through recurring transaction fees 
the company s alm lease pricing generally is tiered based on the number of alms ordered and operated by each customer 
however  the terms of each contract reflect negotiations between the company and the customer 
depending on whether certain criteria are met  alm leases may be reported as sales type leases or operating leases 
pursuant to the company s standard alm automated loan system agreement the als agreement  i the company a grants to the customer a non exclusive right to use the software supported by the company s decisys rt system and b agrees to provide technical assistance to the customer during the term of such agreement and ii the customer agrees to pay the initial set up fee  a non refundable fee for the non exclusive right to use the software as well as fees for each application and each loan transaction consummated based on a percentage of the principal amount of the loan 
at the time an order is placed by a customer  the company typically collects a non refundable set up fee as well as a non refundable fee for the non exclusive right to use the software  all of which are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
generally  upon installation of an alm  the company recognizes as revenue the non refundable fee for the non exclusive right to use the software and a portion of the set up fee in an amount approximately equal to the cost of set up and installation of such alm  with the remainder of such set up fee amortized ratably over the term of the als agreement 
additionally  under the als agreement  the company collects other miscellaneous processing fees that are designed to help the company recapture a portion of its processing costs 
the company recognizes these fees as revenue when earned under the terms of the als agreement 
the company generally leases alm hardware to its customers under a standard rental agreement that typically is non cancelable and has a term of months  although certain of the company s agreements allow customers to terminate such agreements prior to the end of their term in certain circumstances 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  the company treats certain leases as sales type leases  and other leases are treated as operating leases 
for its sales type leases  under sfas  the company recognizes as revenue  generally upon alm installation  the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments to be received during the term of the related rental agreement using the company s estimated incremental borrowing rate for lease secured transactions as the discount rate 
the difference between the aggregate future minimum lease payments and the present value of such lease payments is capitalized as unearned interest income and amortized into revenue over the term of the rental agreement 
for operating leases  the company recognizes lease payments as revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue and operating results may result depending on whether leases consummated during a period are sales type or operating leases 
prior to may   the company generally used an agreement that provided for i an initial fee  substantially all of which is credited against future licensing fees at a predetermined rate over the term of the agreement  and ii monthly or quarterly licensing fees equal to the greater of a minimum amount and a fee calculated based upon the principal amount of loans funded 
such agreements have terms of  or months 
the company has recorded the prepaid portion of the initial fee as deferred revenue  which is amortized over the term of the particular agreement 
the company treats such agreements as operating leases 
accordingly  monthly and quarterly fees under such agreements are recognized as revenue over the term of the applicable agreements 
the company depreciates the cost of alms leased under such agreements over five years using the straight line method 
at december   there were alms in service under such agreements 
in conjunction with the installation of the company s technology  the company may agree to perform additional customer specific technology development for the customer 
the company generally enters into a contract with the customer for the performance of these services which typically defines deliverables  specific delivery and acceptance dates and specified fees for such services 
upon completion and acceptance of the deliverables by the customer  the company recognizes the corresponding revenue as professional services 
the company accounts for research and development costs as operating costs and expenses such costs in the period incurred 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes software costs incurred in the development of a software application after the technological feasibility of the application has been established 
technological feasibility is established when an application design and a working model of the application have been completed and the completeness of the working model and its consistency with the application design have been confirmed by testing 
from the time technological feasibility is established until the time the relevant application is available for general release to customers  software development costs incurred are capitalized at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
thereafter  costs related to the application are again expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized using the greater of the revenue curve or straight line method over the estimated economic life of the application 
software costs capitalized include direct labor  other costs directly associated with the development of the related application and an allocation of indirect costs  primarily facility costs and other costs associated with the company s software development staff 
the company bases such allocation on the percentage of the company s total labor costs represented by the software development labor costs 
results of operations revenues the company s revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and rental fees of  initial set up fees of  professional services of  and transaction fees and other income of  represented approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues for during the company s revenues consisted of sales and rental fees of  non recurring license revenue of  initial set up fees of  and transaction and other fees of  which accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues for sales and rental fees of  initial set up fees of  and transaction and other fees of  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues for the decrease in sales and rental fees for the year ended december  as compared to is due to an overall decrease in the number of alms deployed under sales type leases during the increase in sales and rental fees for the year ended december  as compared to is primarily attributable to an overall increase in the number of alms deployed under sales type and operating leases during during  the company consummated sales type leases for alms compared to and alm sales type leases in and  respectively 
the increase in initial set up fees for the year ended december  as compared to is attributable to a general increase in the amount of set up fees charged as well as set up fees which were recognized in association with the deployment of alms in conjunction with a short term pilot program 
the increase in initial set up fees for the year ended december  as compared to is essentially attributable to an increase in the number of alms deployed during under both sales type and operating leases 
at december   and  there were a total of  and alms  respectively  under both sales type and operating leases 
subsequent to december   the company and a significant alm customer terminated their relationship with respect to alms under sales type and operating leases 
the company does not believe that such action had or will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
the increase in transaction fees and other income for the year ended december  as compared to is primarily attributable to transaction revenue earned from financial service applications processed using decisys rt and from processing credit card and other debit card transactions 
in addition  during the company experienced an increase in revenue associated with the accretion of deferred fees due to an increase in the overall number of alms under both sales type and operating leases throughout as compared to the increase in transaction fees and other income for the year ended december  as compared to is primarily due to an increase in transaction fees and revenue associated with the accretion of deferred fees  both of which are associated with an increase in the overall number of alms under both sales type and operating leases throughout as compared to non recurring license fees of million during reflect one time license fees paid by union planters corporation to affinity processing corporation apc  a subsidiary of the company  for a perpetual  royalty free license to use the company s call center decisioning system formerly known as assets in north america 
pursuant to an arrangement among the company  apc and union planters  all amounts paid by union planters to apc as license fees were paid by apc to the company as license fees 
during the company recognized revenue associated with contracts to perform professional services  primarily for one customer 
generally such services involve customizing the company s products to operate in accordance with a customer s specifications 
prior to the company had not entered into any significant agreements of this type 
total alm sales and professional services for were to customers 
all alm sales represented new customer relationships  while professional services were performed for of the new customers 
one customer accounted for and of alm sales and rental and professional services revenue  while two customers accounted for and  respectively  of total revenue during for information relating to customer revenue concentrations for  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements segment information 
the loss of any one of these customers may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations due to the developing nature of the company s customer base and revenue streams 
the company expects that a substantial portion of the company s operating revenues in the future may continue to be attributable to relatively few customers 
such customer concentration may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual revenues due to the uncertainty of the timing of new and additional orders for alms 
in  the company continued to experience disappointing revenue growth and an extremely lengthy sales cycle for its products 
average consumer use of alms in service and average rates for loan approvals have been lower than most customers expectations 
while certain customers have deployed their alms in a manner that has resulted in acceptable loan approval rates  the company believes that the economic viability of the alm as an acceptable alternative to traditional and new lending methods has not yet been established  which has resulted in the terminations of the company s relationship with one significant alm customer  another potentially significant alm customer and certain other alm customers 
such activities did not significantly affect the company s historical operating results

the cost of designing  assembling and installing individual alms fluctuated significantly during prior to september  the company incurred significant costs in customizing alm designs for customers 
since that time  the company has standardized the base operating system and redesigned the cabinet structure  graphics and component installation to reduce the cost  assembly time and alm size 
further  during and the company outsourced certain aspects of alm cabinet construction  hardware assembly and delivery to reduce costs 
research and development
