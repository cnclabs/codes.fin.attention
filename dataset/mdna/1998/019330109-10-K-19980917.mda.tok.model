in addition  the company decided to close its toronto  canada facility and to combine substantially all of its operations with the operations of hathaway process instrumentation  the carrolton  texas division 
the initiatives were aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity and efficiency 
the restructuring provision was primarily comprised of estimated costs for employee severance benefits and fixed asset write offs 
the payouts related to the restructuring charge were made in and in the first quarter of  management decided to restructure the power products manufacturing operations to produce operating efficiencies and to better utilize local management talent and expertise

business acquisition effective september   the company acquired a partnership interest in tate integrated systems  lp and of the stock of the sole general partner  tate integrated systems  inc collectively referred to as tis 
the ownership interests were acquired for an adjusted negotiated price of  of which  was paid in cash at closing on october    on june  and  when certain accounts receivable of tis were collected during fiscal tis has operated under the ownership of hathaway industrial automation hia  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the company  since october  hia is located in hunt valley  maryland and is a full service supplier of process automation systems for industrial applications 
hia has developed a state of the art software system for supervisory control and data acquisition scada and distributed control systems dcs 
the hia system has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and wastewater treatment plants  glass manufacturing plants  oil and gas terminals and tank farm facilities 
in addition to expanding into its traditional process markets  hia s system is being marketed to the power utility industry 
the company expects to team the hia system with certain existing hathaway products and target the combined product at substation automation and integration applications used in the generation  distribution and transmission of power 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the fair values at the date of acquisition 
for the year ended june  and the nine month post acquisition period ended june   hia had losses before income taxes of approximately million and million  respectively 
hia s traditional business is highly dependent on sales to the industrial market which typically encompasses a long sales cycle  significant customization to specific customer requirements  long performance periods and large contract values which are subject to a high degree of scrutiny and negotiation with customers 
since the company s acquisition of hia in september  the company has seen significant deterioration in the margins of contracts awarded in this market  and  in several instances  hia has declined to submit a bid or has not been awarded a project bid due to competitor prices or customer specifications that would have resulted in insignificant or negative contract margin 
as a result of its acquisition of hia  the company recorded goodwill of  primarily due to loss accruals on an in process contract acquired by the company 
at june  and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired from its acquisition of tis was impaired  and  therefore  wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  the company s determination was based on projections of undiscounted cash flows of hia  which were based on current marketplace and competitive conditions and resulting low margins for the industrial applications of hia s product 
such undiscounted cash flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired 
utilizing such projections and discounting the estimated cash flows  the company determined that the entire unamortized amount was impaired 
the current year amortization of  and impairment write off of  totaling  is included in amortization of intangibles and other in the fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
the company is investing substantial resources in hia  consistent with the company s strategy to develop applications of the hia software for the deregulated power industry 
management believes that the software products developed by hia  as modified for the power industry and combined with other company products  will provide power companies with automated and integrated systems solutions that will both reduce their operating costs and improve the reliability of their power supply 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications will be successful and or economically viable 
management believes that there is significant demand in the power industry for such solutions as a result of the business environment created by the recent industry deregulation 
the successful implementation of the company s current business plan is partially dependent on the company s ability to successfully market hia s products to the deregulated power industry 
the factors that will affect the success of implementing this business plan include  but are not limited to  the ability to win a sufficient amount of project work on favorable terms to the company  the ability to complete projects in a timely and cost effective manner  and the existence of sufficient demand for the hia products 
an inability to achieve this plan in the planned timeframe may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash increased  during the year to a balance of  at june  fiscal operating activities generated  compared to  used in fiscal and  used in of the  generated in   was used to fund the operations of the hia business and  was generated from operating activities of the company s other businesses 
of the  used in by operating activities   was used to fund the operations of the hia business and  was generated from the operating activities of the company s other businesses 
the consolidated increased cash generated from operations in was primarily due to increased revenues  the overall cost reduction efforts of the company and net income tax refunds of  received during fiscal cash of  and  was used by investing activities in fiscal and  respectively  compared to  generated in fiscal the cash generated by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds of  from maturities of marketable securities 
the cash used for investing activities includes  paid for the interest acquired in tis 
the cash used for investing activities includes  paid for the interest acquired in tis and  paid for capital expenditures 
financing activities used   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for financing activities from to was primarily due to repayments on the line of credit 
the decrease in cash used for financing activities from to occurred primarily because no dividends were paid to stockholders in  as compared to  of dividends paid to stockholders in at june   the company had  of debt  compared with  at june   a reduction of  the debt at june  represents borrowings on the company s previous long term financing agreement midland agreement with marine midland business loans  inc the midland agreement was a reducing revolving line of credit with a borrowing limit that was reduced monthly over the seven year term of the loan 
on june   the company repaid the  balance on this loan and terminated the midland agreement 
the debt at june  represents borrowings on the company s current long term financing agreement agreement with silicon valley bank silicon 
the agreement matures on may  and is subject to automatic annual renewal 
beginning in may  the company may terminate the agreement with no termination fee 
borrowings on the loan are restricted to the lesser of  or of the company s eligible receivables maximum credit limit 
as of june   the company could borrow an additional  up to the maximum credit limit of  the loan bears interest at silicon s prime borrowing rate prime rate plus at june  
the interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly basis to prime rate plus if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period 
the company must continue to meet this quarterly financial goal  or the rate will be re adjusted to prime rate plus 
in addition to interest  the loan bears a monthly unused line fee at of the maximum credit limit less the average daily balance of the outstanding loan during a month 
the unused line fee is also adjustable on a quarterly basis  if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period  the monthly unused line fee will be adjusted to 
the company must continue to meet this quarterly financial goal  or the rate will be re adjusted to 
the debt is secured by all assets of the company 
the agreement requires that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth 
at june   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
the company has three joint venture investments in china zibo kehui electric company ltd 
kehui  hathaway si fang protection and control company  ltd 
si fang  and hathaway power monitoring systems company  ltd 
hpms 
kehui designs  manufactures and sells cable and overhead fault location  scada systems and other test instruments within the china market and the company will sell these products outside of china 
si fang designs  manufactures and sells a new generation of digital protective relays  control equipment and instrumentation products for substations in power transmission and distribution systems and the company will sell these products outside of china 
hpms will design  manufacture and sell  under a license from hathaway  instrumentation products designed by hathaway  to electric power companies in china 
there are no future commitments relating to these investments 
the company accounts for the chinese joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
at the time of the original investments in the chinese joint ventures and subsequently  the company determined that due to the start up nature of the entities  their untested products and political uncertainty in china  the realization of the initial investment and subsequent earnings which were not significant was uncertain  and  therefore  the company fully reserved against the original investments and its share of any equity in income thereafter  and recognized income from the chinese joint ventures only as cash dividends were received 
during fiscal year  the operations of si fang and kehui have continued to mature  their products have gained significant acceptance and they have indicated sustained profitability while the operations of hpms are still in the development stage and continue to incur losses 
in fiscal year  because of the sustained positive operating results of si fang and kehui combined with the fact that both of these joint ventures are still subject to a certain amount of political and business uncertainty in china  the company recognized a portion of its share of equity in income from these two joint ventures totaling  which is included in other assets and equity income from investments in joint ventures in the fiscal year consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations  respectively 
this amount represents management s best estimate of the amounts expected to be received from the joint ventures as of june  the company will continue to recognize the portion of its share of equity in income loss from these two joint ventures to the extent it believes such amounts are realizable 
the company also has an interest in a joint venture jv with kub holdings bhd  a malaysian firm 
the interest  acquired by tis for  in march  was acquired by the company in connection with the purchase of tis effective september  the fair market value of this asset was not significant at the acquisition date 
the jv was created for the purpose of manufacturing  marketing and selling the tis system in certain asian countries 
if the jv requires funding  the company may be required to contribute in accordance with the agreed upon proportions as defined in the jv agreement 
as of june   the company had ceased all operations of the jv due to unprofitablity 
the company is currently in the process of winding down the partnership 
the jv agreement also requires the company to continue as a going concern and to provide support services to the jv at market rates 
if the company does not meet this requirement  it could be required to refund a contractually defined portion  at june  of the  proceeds tis received in from the sale to the jv of licensing and marketing rights to the tis technology 
because of the remote possibility of the company being required to make such a refund  this obligation was determined to be zero at the acquisition date 
further  as of september   because sales have ceased  the company does not expect that such refunds will be required 
in addition  the company is not aware of any violations of the requirements defined in the jv agreement nor does it anticipate any future violations 
as in the three year period ended june   the company s fiscal working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from the existing cash balance of  and the  available under the long term financing agreement at june  the company believes that such amounts are sufficient to fund operations and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance some computers and computer based systems use only the last two digits to identify a year in the date field and cannot distinguish the year from the year the company recognizes that the year poses a challenge to the proper functioning of computer systems included in its products  items purchased from its suppliers and software systems used in its business 
the company is taking what it believes to be appropriate steps necessary in preparation for year issues 
the company has assessed its products and application software systems and has concluded that no major changes or updates are required 
minor modifications and updates are being made as needed 
an assessment of its suppliers and service providers is ongoing and is expected to be completed by june  the company does not anticipate that the overall costs of adaptation of its products and systems will be material  however the company will continue to review on an ongoing basis whether it needs to further address any anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year consequences 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipated that these factors would continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of june   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at june   approximately million was outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit matures in may and is subject to automatic annual renewal 
beginning in may  the company may pay the balance in full at any time without penalty 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates which are tied to various market indices 
additionally  the company monitors interest rates frequently and has sufficient cash balances to pay off the line of credit and any early termination penalties  should interest rates increase significantly 
as a result  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
foreign currency risk the company has a wholly owned subsidiary located in northern ireland 
sales from this operation are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the british us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the british pound
