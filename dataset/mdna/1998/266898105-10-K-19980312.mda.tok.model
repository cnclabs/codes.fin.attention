liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its development stage operations primarily from sales of securities in public offerings 
in may  the company completed a public offering in which  shares of its common stock were sold at per share  resulting in the company receiving  which was net of offering costs of  in december  the company had sold  shares of its common stock at per share  and received  which was net of offering costs of   of the proceeds from the december offering were used to repurchase options held by draxis see below 
as of december   the company s total assets  consisting primarily of united states government securities available for sale  were  as compared to  as of december  the company s united states government securities available for sale have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  provision for which has been charged to shareholders equity 
at december   the aggregate cost was  and had a market value of  resulting in an unrealized loss of  the market value of the company s government securities fluctuates  with changes in interest rates in the united states from the time these securities were acquired 
some losses could be realized  depending upon the timing of the company s need to convert government securities into cash to meet its working capital requirements 
the company s us government securities currently have yields ranging from to  and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  as of december  the company s us government securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  the company has invested its funds in liquid investments  so that it will have ready access to its cash reserves as needed for the funding of its development plan on a short term and long term basis

management is currently focusing its attention and its funds on preparation of the ak nda  clinical trials of its bladder cancer detection indication and securing additional funds for the company  preferably through a strategic alliance  or other financing activity 
see reference above under general to marketing and development agreement 
full development and testing of all potential indications which are currently under development would require additional funding 
the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including the filing of its ak nda  progress of the company s research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  payments under any collaborative arrangements  if any  entered into by the company and the availability of alternate financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funds will be sufficient to enable the company to obtain regulatory marketing approval or to market any product for any indications currently under development 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized 
consequently  in order to maintain continuing research and development programs  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources 
if sufficient funds are available  the company may also use its resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that enhance or expand the company s business

results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  the company has had no sales to date 
at the current time  the company s most advanced clinical program in levulan r pdt pd is for actinic keratoses aks 
the company has completed two parallel phase iii clinical trials using levulan r pdt for treatment of pre cancerous aks of the face and scalp 
with the phase iii now complete  the company is in the process of preparing its first nda 
the company anticipates that the nda will be filed with the fda during the second quarter of  but the timing is dependent upon a third party who is not within the company s control 
delays in this process would delay potential fda marketing approval and could have a significant impact on the financial strength of the company 
in march  the company initiated a phase i ii multicenter clinical study examining the use of levulan r and a proprietary non laser light source for human hair removal 
the trials are expected to be completed in in may  the company signed an agreement with richard wolf medical instruments corp  to collaborate on the development of the company s levulan r pd process for enhanced detection of bladder cancer 
under the agreement  wolf will provide  at no cost to the company  proprietary non laser light sources and cystoscopes  along with technical and regulatory support  for the company s clinical trials for this indication 
the company and wolf intend to co operate in the marketing of the levulan r pd system for bladder cancer detection  once the appropriate approval has been received from the fda 
the company also has the right under the agreement to qualify other manufacturers light sources and or cystoscopes with the fda for use in levulan r pd of bladder cancer

see note h 
to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the time required to complete the government regulatory approval process ie  the length of time required by the company to complete the nda prior to filing  together with the fda review process and any additional development activities that may be required will have a direct effect on whether the company will maintain its current funding levels for all of the levulan r pdt pd indications which it is currently supporting 
in order to maintain the research and development program as now planned through and beyond  the company will need to raise additional funds 
it may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies  in which it will seek to have an alliance partner make upfront and or milestone payments  and assume certain of the costs of clinical testing and of obtaining regulatory marketing approval for the products licensed 
as stated above  the company is currently engaged in serious negotiations with a multi national pharmaceutical company for such an arrangement 
however  there is no assurance at this time that a transaction will be consummated 
to the extent that the company is unable to enter into such arrangements  it will require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for bladder cancer detection 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds to obtain approval of any product  that any product will be successfully developed  proven to be safe and effective in necessary pivotal clinical trials  or receive applicable regulatory marketing approvals 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized 
in the absence of additional funding in the first half of  the company intends to allocate research and development funds primarily to its bladder cancer photodetection trials but would likely delay further development of other secondary indications 
interest income  earned primarily on united states government securities  decreased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   as the company continues to expend funds for ongoing research and development 
interest income  the only significant source of income at the current time  is expected to decline as funds are expended for research and development programs 
interest income for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  was  research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in costs reflects the completion of multiple multi center phase iii trials for ak  preparation for the filing of the ak nda  and preparation for a initiation of the bladder cancer pd phase i ii trial 
should the company complete a strategic alliance in the near term  the company would utilize additional funds received to accelerate its clinical program 
research and development costs could increase up to approximately above expenditures 
should additional funds not be available  research and development expenditures for would be significantly reduced from levels 
total research and development costs for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  were  costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit the company to make payments during of  and  in see note h

see results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  net of the compensation costs in  operating expenses continue to increase as a result of hiring of additional personnel  investor relations expenditures  and activities related to identifying and examining potential strategic alliances for its business 
operating costs are expected to increase in the future as the company continues to add personnel  including additional executive officers in expectation of fda approval of its ak nda 
the company incurred a net loss of   or per share for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december  net losses for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  were  or per share 
such losses are consistent with the company s expectations and the company anticipates that losses will continue throughout the development stage 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses  as it continues to progress with its research and development program and clinical trials  until it can develop sufficient revenues from sales of its products to cover all costs and expenses 
the company s revenues to date have been limited and substantially all of the company s revenues have consisted of interest income 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  manufacture and market proprietary products 
there is no way to accurately predict the timing or magnitude of revenues from the marketing of levulan r pdt for any indication or whether any revenues will ever be realized 
year compliance 
the financial impact to the company of year compliance has not been and is not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company has recently purchased and installed information systems  consisting of hardware and software supplied by third parties  which are year compliant 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computers could reinfect the company s computer systems 
the company could be adversely affected by the year problem if it or unrelated parties fail to successfully address this problem 
the company intends to develop a plan to communicate with the unrelated parties  including its regulatory consultants with whom it deals  to coordinate year compliance 
the costs incurred in addressing year compliance will be expensed as incurred  in compliance with gaap

for the remainder of  the company continued to utilize services of several draxis personnel under the terms of the draxis management agreement while the company increased its own staff 
the company did not use any services from draxis after and the draxis management agreement was terminated effective february  as provided by the agreement 
during  the company filed for and obtained approval to be de listed from the toronto stock exchange tse
