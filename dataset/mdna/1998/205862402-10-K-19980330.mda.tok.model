liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  bank time deposits of approximately  short term investments of approximately  and working capital of approximately  the company believes that its existing working capital  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide for its planned operations at least through december  the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business  and anticipates that it may from time to time issue additional debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities can be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated acquisition cost 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have not been  and are not anticipated to be  materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the ability of its subsidiaries in israel to pay dividends or by withholding taxes associated with any such dividend payments 
cash dividends paid by an israeli corporation to united states residents are subject to withholding of israeli income tax at source at rates of up to  depending on the particular facilities that have generated the earnings that are the source of the dividends 
year the company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of the work required to make its systems  products and infrastructure year compliant and has begun work to prepare its products and its financial  information and other computer based systems for the year  including replacing and or updating existing legacy systems 
the company continues to evaluate the estimated costs associated with these efforts 
while these efforts will involve additional costs  the company believes  based on available information  that it will be able to manage its total year transition without any material adverse effect on its business operations  products or financial prospects 
certain trends and uncertainties the company has benefited from the growth in its business and capital base over the past three years to make significant new investment in its operations and infrastructure intended to enhance its opportunities for future growth and profitability 
the company s results of operations reflect the significant increase in its investment in operations over the past three years 
the company intends to continue during to make significant investments in the growth of its business  and to examine opportunities for additional growth through acquisitions and strategic investments 
the impact of these decisions on future profitability cannot be predicted with assurance  and the company s commitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to unforeseen downturns in its markets  technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions 
however  the company believes that significant opportunities exist in the markets for each of its main product lines  and that continued strong investment in its technical  product development  marketing and sales capabilities will enhance its opportunities for long term growth and profitability 
the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
the combination of two sizable technology based companies involves significant complexities  and no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to integrate the operations of boston into the company without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key comverse or boston personnel or that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
the integration of two companies across geographically dispersed operations can create the risk of disruption in operations of the combined company  and neither company s management has substantial experience in managing such integration or the operations of an entity the size of the combined company 
the company does not expect to realize cost savings in the near future as a result of the merger  and no assurance can be given that any savings can be achieved in future periods 
furthermore  there can be no certainty that the merger will not adversely affect the relationships with key customers or key vendors of either company 
as a result of its significantly greater concentration on a small number of large telephone company customers  boston s business has historically been considerably more volatile than that of comverse  and the operations of the combined company are likely to be less predictable and subject to greater risks from actions of individual customers than the operations of comverse in recent years 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological change 
the company s revenue stream will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
this includes any customer requested custom software enhancements required in the normal course of product delivery and customer demands for the technological convergence of the company s products 
the company s products involve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards 
there can be no assurance the company s current or future products will not develop operational problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  if the company were to delay the introduction of new products  or to delay the delivery of specific custom software enhancements  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
the company sells a majority of its products to companies in the telecommunications industry 
this industry is undergoing significant change as a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide  reducing restrictions on competition in the industry 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment may have an impact on the company s revenues and or costs in any given part of the world 
the worldwide enhanced services systems industry is already highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify 
the company believes that existing competitors will continue to present substantial competition  and that other companies  many with considerably greater financial  marketing and sales resources than the company  may enter the enhanced services systems markets 
the acquisition of octel communications corporation  a significant competitor of the company  by lucent technologies  inc may intensify the competitive environment in the industry  and there can be no assurance that similar business combinations or industry consolidation will not occur in the future 
the enhanced services platforms industry has experienced a continuing evolution of product offerings and alternatives for delivery of services 
these trends have affected and may be expected to have a significant continuing influence on conditions in the industry  although the impact on the industry generally and on the company s position in the industry cannot be predicted with assurance 
significant changes in the industry make planning decisions more difficult and increase the risk inherent in the planning process 
the market for telecommunications monitoring systems is also in a period of significant transition 
budgetary constraints  uncertainties resulting from the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications environment and shifts in the pattern of government expenditures resulting from geopolitical events have increased uncertainties in the market  resulting in certain instances in the attenuation of government procurement programs beyond their originally expected performance periods and an increased incidence of delay  cancellation or reduction of planned projects 
the continuing delay and uncertainties surrounding the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea have had a significant impact on acquisition plans of law enforcement agencies in north america engaged in monitoring activities  and no assurances can be given as to the timing or ultimate content of the proposed legislation 
competitive conditions in this sector have also been affected by the increasing use by certain potential government customers of their own internal development resources rather than outside vendors to provide certain technical solutions 
in addition  a number of established government contractors  particularly developers and integrators of technology products  have taken steps to redirect their marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut backs in their traditional areas of focus  resulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests for proposals 
the lack of predictability in the timing and scope of government procurements have similarly made planning decisions more difficult and have increased the associated risks 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales and operating profit from a relatively small number of contracts for large system installations with major customers 
boston s operating results  in particular  have often been characterized by volatility and lack of predictability  reflecting its traditional customer concentration among major telecommunications services providers such as the regional bell operating companies 
the company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its product development and marketing strategies 
contracts for large installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict 
the company believes that opportunities for large installations will continue to grow in both its commercial and government markets  and intends to continue to expand its research and development  manufacturing  sales and marketing and product support capabilities in anticipation of such growth 
however  the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted different strategies  and than the company has experienced in prior periods 
although the company is actively pursuing a number of significant procurement opportunities in the united states and internationally  both the timing of any eventual procurements and the probability of the company s receipt of significant contract awards are uncertain 
the degree of dependence by the company on large orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
the company has significantly increased its expenditures in all areas of its operations during recent periods  including the areas of research and development and marketing and sales  and the company plans to further increase these expenditures in the foreseeable future 
the increase in research and development expenditures reflects the company s concentration on enhancing the range of features and capabilities of its existing product lines and developing new generations of its products 
the company believes that these efforts are essential for the continuing competitiveness of its product offerings and for positioning itself to participate in future growth opportunities in both the commercial and government sectors 
the increase in sales and marketing expenditures primarily results from the company s decision to expand its activities and direct presence in a growing number of world markets 
the company s costs of operations have also been affected by increases in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting both from general inflation and increases in the cost of attracting and retaining qualified scientific  engineering and technical personnel in israel  where the demand for such personnel is growing rapidly with the expansion of technology based industries in that country 
the increase in these costs in recent periods has not been offset by proportional devaluation of the israeli shekel against the united states dollar  and accordingly has had a negative impact on the company s overall results of operations 
continuation of such trends may have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s research and development and manufacturing operations are located in israel and may be affected by regulatory  political  military and economic conditions in that country 
the company s historical operating results reflect substantial benefits from programs sponsored by the israeli government for the support of research and development  as well as favorable tax rates available to approved enterprises in israel 
the israeli government has indicated its intention to reexamine certain of its policies in these areas 
recently  the government acted to increase  from between and of associated product sales to of associated product revenues including service and other related revenues  the annual rate of royalties to be applied to repayment of benefits under the conditional grant program administered by the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade  a program in which the company has regularly participated and under which it continues to receive significant benefits through reimbursement of qualified research and development expenditures 
the company s repayment of amounts received under the program will be accelerated through these higher royalty rates until repayment is completed 
in addition  permission from the government of israel is required for the company to manufacture outside of israel products resulting from research and development activities funded under such programs  or to transfer outside of israel related technology rights  and in order to obtain such permission the company may be required to increase the royalties to the applicable funding agencies and or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and development costs 
the company expects to incur additional royalty expenses and or repayment obligations as a result of the merger and the location of certain manufacturing and research and development operations pertaining to its trilogue product line at its boston facilities 
the israeli authorities have also indicated that this funding program will be further reduced in the future  particularly for larger entities such as the company 
the israeli government has also shortened the period of the tax moratorium applicable to approved enterprises from four years to two years 
although this change has not affected the tax status of most of the company s current projects  it will apply to any future approved enterprises of the company 
if further changes in the law or government policies regarding those programs were to result in their termination or adverse modification  or if the company were to become unable to participate in or take advantage of those programs  the cost to the company of its operations in israel would materially increase and there would be an adverse effect on the results of the company s operations as a whole 
to the extent the company increases its activities outside israel  which will result from the merger and possible future acquisitions  such increased activities will not be eligible for programs sponsored by israel 
the company s research and development and manufacturing operations attributable to boston are expected to continue to be located in the united states and thus will not be eligible for the benefits of those programs 
accordingly  the effective cost to the company of its future research and development activities in particular  and its operations in general  could significantly increase relative to that of comverse  historically 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its total sales from customers outside of the united states 
international transactions involve particular risks  including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade conditions  rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries  turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets  and increased costs resulting from lack of proximity to the customer 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the company has  and anticipates that it will continue to receive  significant contracts denominated in foreign primarily western european and japanese currencies 
as a result of the unpredictable timing of purchase orders and payments under such contracts and other factors  it is often not practicable for the company to effectively hedge the risk of significant changes in currency rates during the contract period 
since the company will hedge the exchange rate risks associated with long term contracts denominated in foreign currencies only to a limited extent  operating results can be affected by the impact of currency fluctuations as well as the cost of such hedging 
while the company believes that prevailing economic conditions in the far east and southeast asia have reduced the demand for its systems in certain countries  overall sales in the region have increased over the past months 
the company cannot currently predict the effect on its business should regional economic conditions fail to improve 
the trading price of the company s shares may be affected by the factors noted above as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
share prices of companies in technology and government contracting businesses  and particularly smaller and medium sized publicly traded companies such as the company  tend to exhibit a high degree of volatility 
the company s revenues and earnings may be more volatile than that of comverse historically as a result of the greater concentration of boston s business on a limited number of large customers 
shortfalls in revenues or earnings from the levels anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of the company s sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
these factors contribute to the volatility of the trading value of its shares regardless of the company s long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the voice processing industry  which may not have any direct relationship with the company s business or prospects
