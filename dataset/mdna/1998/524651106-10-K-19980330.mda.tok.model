year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies will need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer systems improvements to be year compliant 
although the company believes its software products are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all the necessary software routines and programs for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of data involving dates 
the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
although the company believes the software and hardware it uses internally comply with year requirements and is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internally used software and hardware for the year  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious  unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition
