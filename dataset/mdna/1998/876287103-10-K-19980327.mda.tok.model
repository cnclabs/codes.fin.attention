in those instances in which estimates of fair value less estimated selling costs of the company s properties held for sale are less than the carrying values thereof at the time of evaluation  an allowance for loss is provided by a charge against operations 
the evaluation generally includes selective site inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of the surrounding area 
future evaluations could cause the company s management to adjust current estimates of fair value

this review generally consists of a review of the property s cash flow and current and projected market conditions  as well as any changes in general and local economic conditions 
if an impairment loss exists based on the results of this review  a loss is recognized by a charge against current earnings and a corresponding reduction in the respective asset s carrying value
