special considerations the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will continue to provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to remain profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
in periods of high fuel prices  the company offsets the effect of price increases through fuel surcharges to customers or through rate increases in lieu of fuel surcharges 
the company also periodically hedges against future fuel price increases by purchasing defined quantities of fuel for future delivery at contracted prices 
future increases or decreases in fuel prices are uncertain 
to the extent the company is unable to offset fuel price increases through fuel surcharges  rate increases or hedges  increased fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense  and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitiors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
if interest rates increased significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity during the nine month transition period ended december  were funds provided by operations  borrowings under long term debt facilities  lines of credit  proceeds from the sale of equipment  the use of operating leases for revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of common stock 
at december  the company had in place a  credit facility with a group of banks  of which  was available for borrowing 
in  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  and operating lease financing for the acquisition of revenue equipment 
cash generated from operations increased to  in the transition period from  for the twelve months ended march  net cash used in investment activities was  in the transition period and  for the twelve months ended march  of the net cash used in investment activities in the transition period   was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to  for the twelve months ended march  the increase in purchases of property and equipment is due primarily to the purchase of revenue equipment previously financed with operating leases 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in the transition period compared to  used in the twelve months ended march  the increase was due primarily to proceeds received from the sale of common stock through the public offering in august as a result  the net repayments on the lines of credit and long term debt during the transition period were  compared to  in the twelve months ended march  net payments under lines of credit were  in the transition period  compared to net borrowings of  for the twelve months ended march in january  the company obtained a new revolving line of credit with capacity up to  a portion of the availability under this new line was immediately used to payoff certain existing long term indebtedness bearing higher interest rates 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under installment notes payable  operating lease financing and available borrowings under the company s existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally shows a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season and its inherent weather variations 
the company s operating expenses also have historically been higher in the winter months  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for revenue equipment in colder weather 
acquisition of victory express  inc 
effective january   the company acquired victory express  inc  a non union truckload carrier based in medway  ohio  for million in cash and assumption of approximately million in debt 
prior to the acquisition  victory had annual revenues of approximately million 
victory express serves customers located primarily in the midwest and on the eastern seaboard 
other areas of the country served by victory express include georgia  texas and california 
the company employs approximately persons  including approximately drivers and driver trainees 
through this acquisition  management expects the company to significantly expand its regional capabilities in the midwest and extend its regional service capabilities to the east coast 
victory express customer base is largely centered in automotive  paper  retail and air freight markets 
in addition  us xpress continues to be presented with opportunities for additional business from its customers in the midwest year compliance some computer systems that use two digits to indicate a year will not be able to process data properly for the year the company has assessed the ability of its computer software and operating systems to function in the year and beyond 
systems in use by the company in operations  accounting and purchasing are year compliant 
testing of all us xpress systems for year compliance is scheduled for july systems in use at csi crown are presently compliant with year requirements 
programming to make all csi crown systems year compliant is expected to be completed by december testing of all csi crown systems is scheduled for march a load optimization system purchased from sabre group is year compliant 
a new version of the q tracks satellite communication system that is year compliant has been purchased from qualcomm  inc this system is being installed and is expected to be operational in june the company does not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of its other suppliers and customers 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
the company does not expect the costs of achieving year compliance to be material
