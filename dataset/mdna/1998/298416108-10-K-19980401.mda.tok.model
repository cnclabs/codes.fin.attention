year based on a recent assessment  the company has determined that it will not need to modify or replace its software so that its computer systems will func tion properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also has initiated discussions with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to remed iate properly their computer systems 
the company believes that its products will not be significantly affected by the year issue 
the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transac tions with customers  suppliers  and financial institutions are fully supported 
the company is well under way with these efforts  which are scheduled to be com pleted in early while the company believes its planning efforts are ade quate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the sys tems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the com pany

the company has not yet reached a conclusion as to the appropriate segments  if any  which it will be required to comply with under fas as this is a disclosure only require ment  the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results the company has derived virtually all of its revenues from sales of its digitally controlled audio mixing console system  which system is based upon its hardware platform 
the company believes that sales of this system  along with enhancements thereof  will continue to constitute virtually all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future  with only limited sales of digital audio workstations by spectral 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the com pany s base system  whether technical  competitive or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
a limited number of the company s system sales typically account for a sub stantial percentage of the company s quarterly revenue because of the relatively high average sales price of such systems 
moreover  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue 
therefore  if revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  the timing of revenue is influenced by a num ber of other factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  industry trade shows  seasonal customer buying patterns  changes in product de velopment and sales and marketing expenditures  custom financing arrangements  production limitations and international sales activity 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quar terly earnings shortfalls or losses 
the markets for the company s system are characterized by changing technol ogies and new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its base system with features in cluding new software and hardware add ons and to develop or acquire and intro duce new products and features which meet new market demands and changing cus tomer requirements on a timely basis 
the company is currently designing and developing new products  primarily in the areas of recording  editing and mix ing functions of sound production as well as digital audio processing and net working systems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or tech nologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technolo gies non competitive or obsolete 
see business 
to date  the company s primary market success has been in the music segment of the professional audio market 
in order for the company to grow  the company believes that it must continue to gain market share in the music market segment  as well as in its other targeted market segments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete favorably in any market segments 
the com pany s inability to compete favorably could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and characterized by significant price competition 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on elements both within and outside its control  including the success and timing of new product de velopment including development on a timely basis of a hybrid digital product  of which there can be no assurance and introduction by the company and its com petitors  product performance and price  distribution  availability of lease or other financing alternatives  resale of used systems and customer support 
see business competition 
currently  the company uses many sole or limited source suppliers  certain of which are critical to the integrated circuits included in the company s base system 
major delays or terminations in supplies of such components could have a significant adverse effect on the company s timely shipment of its products  which in turn would adversely affect the company s business and results of oper ations 
the company also relies on single vendors to manufacture major subassem blies for its products 
any extended interruption in the future supply or in crease in the cost of subassemblies manufactured by its primary or other third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
in addition  as different electrical  radiation or other standards applic able to the company s products are adopted in countries  including the united states  or groups of countries in which the company sells its products  the failure of the company to modify its products  if necessary  to comply with such standards would likely have an adverse effect on the company s business and re sults of operations 
see business sales and distribution 
the company generally relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright law and trademark law  contracts and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
however  the company believes that such measures provide only limited protection of its proprietary information  and there is no assurance that such measures will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
in addition  significant and protracted litigation may be necessary to protect the company s intellectual property rights  to deter mine the scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
there can be no assurance that third party claims alleging in fringement will not be asserted against the company in the future 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and re sults of operations 
see business proprietary rights 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to retain key manage ment and technical employees and its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any growth will require it to continue to improve and expand its management  opera tional and financial systems and controls 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  its business and results of operations will be ad versely affected 
the company acquired spectral in february sale of spectral products for and were significantly below plan and below sales levels 
spectral s pre tax operating losses for and also increased signifi cantly due primarily to lower sales volumes and increased engineering staffing costs 
in  spectral engineering  marketing and sales activities were inte grated into the respective euphonix organizations 
in  the company further integrated spectral activities by the transfer of their manufacturing to eupho nix headquarters in palo alto  california 
as a result of these and other factors  the company has experienced signi ficant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
further  it is likely that in some future period the company s net revenues or operating results will be below the expec tations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affec ted
