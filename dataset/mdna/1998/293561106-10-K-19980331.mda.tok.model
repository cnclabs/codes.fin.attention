transwestern plans to expand its pipeline capacity and access new gas supplies by approximately mmcf d 
florida gas also plans to expand its capacity by mmcf d to serve its growing markets by the year additionally  gas pipeline group will continue to monitor its overall cost structure 
pge anticipates continuing retail customer growth in one of the fastest growing service territories in the us in late  pge filed a customer choice plan proposal with the oregon public utility commission opuc which would give all of its customers a choice of electricity providers as early as december under the proposed customer choice plan  pge will separate its generation business from its transmission and distribution businesses and pge will become a regulated transmission and distribution company focused on delivering  but not selling  electricity 
the separation of the generation business is proposed to be accomplished by selling pge s generating assets  either to an enron affiliate or third parties 
in preparation for electric deregulation  pge has begun to leverage from the operational experiences of enron s gas pipeline group which has previously transitioned from providing merchant services to providing transportation services 
enron is unable to predict what changes may be required by the opuc for approval or when the opuc will approve a customer choice plan 
wholesale energy operations and services enron s wholesale energy operations and services businesses are conducted primarily by enron capital trade resources ect and enron international ei

financial risk management wholesale offers price risk management services primarily related to commodities associated with the energy sector natural gas  crude oil  natural gas liquids and electricity 
these services are provided through a variety of financial instruments including forward contracts  which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity  swap agreements  which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  options and other contractual arrangements 
interest rate risks and foreign currency risks associated with the fair value of its energy commodities portfolio are managed in this segment using a variety of financial instruments  including financial futures  swaps and options 
enron s other businesses also enter into forwards  swaps and other contracts primarily for the purpose of hedging the impact of market fluctuations on assets  liabilities  production or other contractual commitments 
changes in the market value of these hedge transactions are deferred until the gain or loss is recognized on the hedged item 
management of the market risks associated with its portfolio of transactions is critical to the success of enron 
therefore  comprehensive risk management processes  policies and procedures have been established to monitor and control these market risks 
enron manages market risk on a portfolio basis  subject to parameters established by its board of directors 
market risks are monitored by an independent risk control group operating separately from the units that create or actively manage these risk exposures to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
enron s fixed price commodity contract portfolio is typically balanced to within an annual average of of the total notional physical and financial transaction volumes marketed 
enron measures the market risk in its portfolios on a daily basis utilizing value at risk and other methodologies 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products 
the use of these methodologies requires a number of key assumptions including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses  the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the value at risk methodologies  including liquidity risk and event risk 
value at risk represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
in addition to using value at risk measures  enron performs regular scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of a sudden market movement on the value of its portfolios stress testing 
the results of the stress testing  along with the professional judgments of experienced business and risk managers  are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and capture additional market related risks  including liquidity  event  concentration and correlation reliance risk 
market risk the use of financial instruments by enron s businesses may expose enron to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity and equity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for enron s price risk management portfolio  the major market risks are discussed below commodity price risk 
commodity price risk is a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers as well as owning and operating production facilities 
as discussed above  enron actively manages this risk on a portfolio basis to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
forwards  futures  swaps and options are utilized to alter enron s consolidated exposure to price fluctuations related to production from its production facilities 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is also a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers and having variable rate debt obligations  as changing interest rates impact the discounted value of future cash flows 
enron utilizes swaps  forwards  futures and options to minimize its interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the result of enron s international operations and price risk management services provided to its worldwide customer base 
the primary purpose of enron s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency purchase and sale transactions 
enron primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts  futures and purchased options to reduce enron s risk profile 
equity risk 
equity risk arises from the finance and investing operations of wholesale  which provides capital to customers through equity participations in various investment activities 
enron manages this risk on an overall basis  including the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options  to ensure compliance with enron s stated risk management policies 
accounting policies accounting policies for price risk management and hedging activities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
value at risk enron has performed an entity wide value at risk analysis of virtually all of enron s financial assets and liabilities 
the value at risk for commodity  interest rate and foreign currency exposures described above is calculated using a monte carlo simulation of delta gamma positions which captures a significant portion of the exposure related to option positions 
the value at risk for equity exposure discussed above is based on jp morgan s riskmetrics tm approach utilizing historical estimates of volatility and correlation 
both value at risk methods utilize a one day holding period and a confidence level 
cross commodity correlations are used as appropriate 
the following table illustrates the value at risk for each component of market risk at december  in millions wholesale non trading market risk commodity price a interest rate foreign currency exchange rate equity a includes only the risk related to the financial instruments that serve as hedges and does not include the related underlying hedged production 
capitalization total capitalization at december  was billion 
debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased to at december  as compared to at december  the increase primarily reflects increased debt  partially offset by the issuance during of approximately million and million shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions of portland general corporation and the minority interest in epp  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming the conversion in late of million exchangeable notes into eog shares held by enron  the pro forma debt to capitalization percentage would be approximately at december  information regarding forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of although enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries  the ability to penetrate new retail natural gas and electricity markets in the united states and europe  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil  natural gas  electricity and interest rates  the extent of eog s success in acquiring oil and gas properties and in discovering  developing and producing reserves  the timing and success of enron s efforts to develop international power  pipeline and other infrastructure projects and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements
