the company opened stores during fiscal  relocated stores and closed underperforming stores 
during fiscal  the company implemented its previously announced strategy to offer additional categories of merchandise at price points other than its traditional retail price 
however  during the implementation of this strategy which is referred to within the company as its expanded price program or epp  management believes that the company confused its customers by introducing too many items at price points higher than its previous price point 
in addition  these higher priced items were offered at too many price points 
this combination of too many higher priced items at too many price points had a negative effect on markdowns and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as discussed below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adjusted its pricing and merchandising strategy by increasing the portion of its merchandise priced at or less 
also  the company established clear policies to limit its higher price point items to only that merchandise which has been determined to be clearly desired by its customers and cannot be offered for  thus focusing its merchandising strategy on quality  value and selection 
such higher priced items will be offered primarily at a limited number of items will be priced at and in response to lower than expected operating results  the company announced a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal the plan includes initiatives which are designed to return the company to profitability by lowering operating costs  redeploying assets and curtailing the number of new store openings until the company s existing stores are operating profitably 
under the restructuring plan the company will close approximately low volume  underperforming stores and eliminate approximately positions 
the company recorded a one time charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal to cover costs associated with the plan 
the total charge of  includes costs to close stores  such as the noncash write off of fixed assets and store supplies of  lease buyouts of approximately  and employee severance  outplacement costs and other miscellaneous expenses of approximately  these initiatives  in the aggregate  are expected to result in future annualized cost savings of approximately million 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from a significantly higher level of markdowns taken during fiscal higher levels of markdowns were taken during the third quarter of fiscal in an effort to clear transitional merchandise which was not fashion right 
higher levels of markdowns were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to clear inventory as part of the company s initiative to aggressively close underperforming stores and to adjust price points in certain merchandise downward as part of the company s strategy to offer most of its merchandise at or under 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal when expressed as a percentage of net sales  home office and store operating costs increased 
sg a expenses in dollars on an average store basis increased 
these increases resulted primarily from increased marketing costs as a result of producing in store signs and posters to promote the new merchandising strategy and to display the many new price points and increased equipment lease costs in the company s home office 
average salaries and wages in the company s stores increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase  affecting primarily part time associates  was due to an increase in average store hours and to increases in the federal minimum wage which were effective in october and september management allocated a higher number of average payroll hours per store in fiscal compared to fiscal because management believed introduction of the higher price points would necessitate additional training and a higher level of customer service 
in fiscal  management intends to focus on process changes which will aid in reducing the rate of increase in store labor costs 
store rent and related expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal average store rent and related expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the continuation of the company s store expansion strategy of increasing the proportion of larger  higher volume stores  and  thus entering more costly sites with higher rents  and the closing of older  underperforming stores which had lower average rent costs 
management anticipates that this trend of increasing average store rents per square foot will continue 
the company has approximately existing leases that expire or have initial lease terms containing lessee renewal options which may be exercised during fiscal management believes that the company will not experience a material increase in aggregate store rents as a result of renewal options or negotiating new lease terms for such locations 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted primarily from fixed asset additions associated with new store openings in fiscal and to software upgrades in the company s home office 
net interest expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in net interest expense resulted from a combination of slightly higher average borrowings and a higher average borrowing rate in fiscal compared to fiscal the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the recording of valuation allowances related to the company s tax loss and credit carryforwards in fiscal management estimates the company s effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal  however  if sufficient levels of profitability are not achieved  the effective income tax rate may increase significantly 
outlook sales trends thus far in fiscal through the easter holiday are modestly ahead of fiscal planned levels through the corresponding time period 
management believes this trend is  in part  due to improvements in the women s apparel industry as a whole  as well as to an improved execution of its merchandising strategy of emphasizing value and quality 
during fiscal  the company intends to focus its efforts on improving sales in existing stores and achieving its margin and cost containment targets 
average store rent and related expenses are expected to increase in fiscal due to the structure of leases on stores opened in fiscal and the closing of older  low volume stores 
management will seek to leverage these increases through improved average store sales volumes 
as part of its strategy to focus on improving sales in existing stores  the company will limit the number of new store openings in fiscal to those for which the company is contractually obligated 
the company will close in fiscal the remainder of the underperforming stores originally identified in the restructuring plan 
approximately such underperforming stores were closed during january five week transition period ended february  compared to four week period ended january  unaudited see note i net sales for the five week period ended february  were  compared to  for the four week period ended january  on an average store basis  net sales decreased 
comparable store sales adjusted for the calendar shift to compare the five week period ended february  to the five week period ended february  decreased 
management believes the decline in sales reflected the continued softness in the women s apparel market experienced throughout fiscal and the impact of adverse weather conditions incurred nationwide in january during january  there were no new stores opened  one store was relocated and stores were closed 
gross margin was in january compared to a deficiency of in january the improvement in gross margin was principally due to the change in accounting for merchandise inventories discussed below and efficiencies in the company s distribution center 
like most retailers  the month of january is historically the lowest sales month of the year  both in absolute dollars and on an average store basis  resulting in substantial markdowns to increase sell off of fall merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in january compared to in january this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is largely due to the decrease in average store sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses on an average store basis  adjusted for the additional week in january compared to january  increased  primarily due to an increase in store operations expenses 
store rent and related expenses decreased to of net sales in january compared to of net sales in january this decrease in store rent and related expenses as a percentage of net sales is due to recording rent expense on a monthly basis in rather than a weekly basis as in the preceding year 
accordingly  rent expense in january  a five week operating period  included one calendar month of rent expense 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in january compared to in january this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the decrease in average store sales and due to the completion of the expansion of the company s distribution center late in the second half of fiscal interest expense increased to of net sales in january compared to in january due to the increased level of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
borrowing levels increased primarily to fund approximately million in capital expenditures for the period february through january the company s effective tax rate for january was

the company s adoption of sfas  required for years beginning after december   resulted in a decrease in net fixed assets of approximately  and a charge of approximately  net of income taxes which is included in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in the statement of operations for the transition period 
the company also elected to change certain methods of accounting for merchandise inventories beginning in the transition period 
the company changed from the lower of average first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting to the lower of cost computed using the fifo retail method or market 
the company believes that the fifo retail method provides improved information for the operation of its business in a manner consistent with the method used widely in the retail industry 
the company also capitalizes into inventory certain merchandise acquisition and distribution costs to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses  particularly in interim periods 
the effect of the change to the fifo retail method was to reduce merchandise inventories by approximately  and the effect of capitalizing into inventory certain merchandise acquisition and distribution costs was to increase merchandise inventories by approximately  these changes in accounting for merchandise inventories resulted in a net increase in merchandise inventories of approximately  and a benefit of approximately  net of income taxes which is included in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in the statement of operations for the transition period 
fiscal year ended february  fiscal compared to fiscal year ended december  fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal total net sales for fiscal compared to the week period ended february  adjusted fiscal increased 
this increase in net sales fiscal compared to adjusted fiscal is primarily due to improvements in the fourth quarter  particularly during the last six weeks of fiscal in fiscal  comparable store sales decreased for the year compared to adjusted fiscal the company opened stores and closed underperforming stores in fiscal compared to opening stores and closing underperforming stores in fiscal in fiscal  eleven stores were relocated compared to relocations in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from efficiencies in the company s distribution center and lower levels of markdowns taken due to management s efforts to control inventory levels and flow 
decreases as a percentage of net sales in distribution costs and markdowns were slightly offset by higher buying costs primarily due to additions to the merchandising staff at the company s home office 
distribution costs in dollars on an average store basis decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in distribution costs was the result of efficiencies associated with the distribution center s first full year of operation since expansion of the facility and the implementation of a new warehouse management system

depreciation and amortization expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted primarily from the completion of the distribution center expansion late in the second half of fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to tax benefits generated in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal these tax benefits included the carryback of the federal targeted jobs tax credit and the recognition in fiscal of the deferred income tax asset associated with the remaining net operating loss carryforward generated by the company s puerto rico subsidiary in inflation during its three most recent fiscal years  the company believes that the impact of inflation has not been material to its financial condition or results of operations 
occasionally  the company may experience slight increases in the average purchase price per unit of merchandise  however  such increases also reflect the impact of an increase in the quality of goods purchased in addition to minimal inflationary factors 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary needs for liquidity and capital have been to fund its new store expansion  the related growth in merchandise inventories and the expansion of the home office and distribution center 
until fiscal  these needs were met principally through cash provided by operations and the company s available line of credit 
beginning in fiscal  additional sources of financing were necessary to fund the company s liquidity and capital needs 
as a result  the company amended its credit agreement to include a term loan facility 
in fiscal  the company replaced this facility with a two year agreement 
in fiscal  the company extended the maturity date of its primary credit facility and replaced a portion of this facility with a twenty year mortgage which  together with cash provided by operations is expected to meet liquidity and capital needs during the period of the agreement 
in may and june and february  the company amended its financing arrangements with its primary lender 
considered together  the amendments provide a three year extension through march and continue to provide a revolving credit facility of up to  including a letter of credit sub facility of up to 
under the june amendment  the company was permitted to enter into a mortgage loan agreement with a commercial bank discussed further below and the term loan portion of the agreement with the primary lender was repaid 
under the may amendment  the term loan was increased by approximately  to  borrowings under the credit agreement with the primary lender are collateralized by all assets owned by the company during the term of the agreement other than the land  building  fixtures and improvements collateralizing the mortgage loan discussed below and bear interest  at the company s option subject to certain limitations in the agreement  at the prime rate plus or the adjusted eurodollar rate  as defined  plus 
maximum borrowings under the revolving credit facility and utilization of the letter of credit facility are based on a borrowing base formula determined with respect to eligible inventory as defined in the agreement 
the amended agreement provides for a temporary adjustment to the lending formula to increase the borrowing availability during the period january  through june  availability under the revolving credit facility fluctuates in accordance with the company s seasonal variations in inventory levels 
at january   the company had approximately million of excess availability under the revised borrowing base formula 
the lending formula may be revised from time to time in response to changes in the composition of the company s inventory or other business conditions 
the company s amended revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants which  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to incur indebtedness  or encumber or dispose of assets  and prohibit the company from repurchasing its common stock or paying dividends 
the company is required to maintain a  minimum level of working capital and to maintain a minimum adjusted net worth as defined in the agreement 
effective january   such minimum net worth requirement was reduced from  to  the company was in compliance with these covenants at january  in may  the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to provide a letter of credit facility of up to  letters of credit issued under the agreement are collateralized by inventories purchased using such letters of credit 
in march  the agreement was amended to adjust the company s minimum net worth requirement to the same level as that required by the company s primary lender under the revolving credit agreement 
on april   the agreement was amended to extend the expiration date of the facility to the earlier of june or termination of the company s revolving credit facility with its primary lender 
the agreement  as amended  contains certain restrictive covenants which are substantially the same as those within the company s amended revolving credit facility discussed above 
in june  the company repaid the term loan portion of its primary credit facility and entered into a twenty year mortgage agreement with a commercial bank 
the agreement provides for a mortgage loan of  secured by the company s real property located at its corporate offices including land  buildings  fixtures and improvements 
commencing august   the mortgage loan is payable in consecutive equal monthly installments including interest at the rate of per annum 
certain fees may be payable by the company if the mortgage loan is repaid prior to june the mortgage agreement contains certain nonfinancial covenants with which the company was in compliance at january  the maximum and average amounts outstanding during fiscal and and amounts outstanding at the end of such periods for both the term loan and revolving credit facility are disclosed in note b to the consolidated financial statements in item of this document 
the company s weighted average interest rate for all borrowings was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company had outstanding letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventories totaling approximately  and  at january  and february   respectively 
at january   total merchandise inventories decreased to  compared to  at february  the decrease in total merchandise inventories is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise in transit to the company s distribution center from its vendors 
most of this year over year in transit decrease a decrease compared to last year related to lower levels of in transit imported goods 
presently  the company is relying more heavily on sourcing inventory through opportunistic purchases from domestic vendors 
in fiscal  import purchases including freight and duty were of total purchases compared to in fiscal merchandise inventories located in the company s stores decreased on an average store basis primarily due to the re pricing of merchandise during the fourth quarter of fiscal the level and source of inventories is subject to fluctuations because of the company s opportunistic buying strategy and prevailing business conditions 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the decrease in merchandise inventories and non cash charges including depreciation and costs associated with disposal of property and equipment due to closing stores as part of the restructuring plan which more than offset the company s net loss 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was   and  respectively  primarily for leasehold improvements and equipment for new stores opened each year  as well as expansions to the distribution center including information systems and hardware in fiscal net cash of  was used in financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of a net repayment on the company s revolving credit facility which exceeded the net borrowings on the company s mortgage loan and term loan facilities 
net cash of  was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of net borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility and net borrowings on the company s term loan facilities 
net cash of  was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of obtaining a term loan facility 
during the transition period  net cash of  provided by financing activities was used to offset the  used in operating activities which resulted primarily from the company s loss during the period 
in fiscal  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  most of which will be used to remodel and relocate existing stores 
while the company s liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future are expected to be met principally through cash provided by operations and the use of its existing credit facilities  a lack of sufficient improvement in operating results during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal may require the company to seek additional financing 
if deemed by management to be in the best interest of the company  additional long term debt  capital leases or other permanent financing may be considered 
year systems readiness the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
based on the review  the company s major systems which would be adversely affected by the year will be replaced or upgraded through the normal course of business 
internal resources will be used in a timely manner to evaluate  modify and test the company s other systems which are not scheduled to be upgraded or replaced through the normal course of business 
management believes the combination of these efforts will prepare the company s computer systems for the year on a timely basis 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the incremental costs associated with major system upgrades and or replacements  as well as internal efforts to evaluate  modify and test the company s other systems are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial statements
