the dollar decline in sales for was the result of an percent decrease in average selling prices verses unit volume was actually up slightly in after experiencing an unprecedented surge in pipe prices during  the trend reversed and prices declined precipitously in back to levels existing before the price increases 
a primary factor contributing to the decline in prices was the pricing trends of flat rolled stainless steel  the raw material from which pipe is made 
pipe prices are closely tied to the cost of flat rolled stainless steel  which experienced similar pricing fluctuations over the past three years 
the bulk of the decrease in operating income occurred in the first quarter of the year when market dynamics were completely different from the first quarter of during the first quarter of  the price declines in stainless steel pipe prices had just begun and profits were still good 
by the first quarter of  prices were down percent from a year earlier and profits were at extremely low levels 
exacerbating the big decline in first quarter profits from stainless pipe was a loss from piping systems and process equipment compared to good profitability in the first quarter of the loss from these products was primarily due to low production levels caused by customer stretch outs in delivery dates 
lower profit based incentives accounted for the decline in selling and administrative expenses 
comparison of and sales and operating income declined and percent  respectively  from the record levels achieved in lower prices accounted for the sales decline since unit volume was essentially unchanged 
after experiencing an unprece dented surge in pipe prices during the first three quarters of  the trend reversed and prices declined precipitously in back to levels existing before the price increases 
two factors caused the unusual swings in prices 
first was the pricing trends of flat rolled stainless steel which are closely tied to the cost of flat rolled stainless steel which experienced similar price fluctuations during and the second factor was an industry wide accumulation of inventories in followed by liquidation of inventories during the industry accumulated significant levels of inventory during in response to rising prices 
however  the rapid reversal of prices left the industry with excessive inventories that negatively impacted demand and prices during as the inventories were reduced to more normal levels by year end 
despite a decline in industry wide shipments  the company was able to generate a four percent increase in pipe unit volume sales indicating the continuation of market share gains the company has experienced over the past seven years 
the rapid decline in sales prices experienced in had a severe impact on operating income 
as flat rolled stainless steel costs fell  the average cost of inventories sold was significantly higher than the average cost of replace ment inventories  which also negatively impacted profitability 
this was a reversal of conditions that existed in when significant profits were gen erated from rapidly rising prices and the sale of inventories with a lower average cost than the average cost to replace those inventories 
in addition  production was reduced during to facilitate the liquidation of inventories creating negative manufacturing variances that reduced profit margins 
the opposite result was experienced in as inventories were built and the increased volume produced lower unit production costs  improving profitability 
lower profit based incentives and sales commissions accounted for the decline in selling and administrative expenses 
chemicals segment the following table summarizes operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note q 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling and adminis trative expense    operating income    comparison of to sales and operating income increased and percent  respectively  aided by the acquisition of mc 
the prolonged decline in textile dyes and pigments sales ended in the first quarter of with each of the subsequent quarters showing improvement over the prior year quarter 
the increased sales in these three quarters of about percent led to a five percent increase for the year 
the improvement resulted from increases in unit volumes in several of the product groups offset somewhat by falling prices from competitive pressure experienced throughout all of the textile dyes and pigments product lines 
the acquisition of mc propelled specialty chemicals to percent of total chemicals segment sales for specialty chemicals sales  without mc s sales for  increased insignificantly over last year 
essentially all of the growth in the chemical segment s operating income was produced by specialty chemicals  as profits from textile dyes and pigments experienced only a moderate gain 
the competitive pressure on selling prices continued to impair profitability throughout in textile dyes and pigments 
the significant increase in specialty chemicals profits came from increased volume from projects  creating improved manufacturing variances that resulted in better profit margins  and the addition of mc 
selling and administrative expenses increased percent from including expenses of mc for a full year in versus two months in  and from additional selling expenses related to the addition of a bu product manager in november of comparison of and sales and operating income declined and percent  respectively  from extremely weak demand for textile dyes and pigments 
the company s product line is heavily dependent on textile printing activity which was especially weak in as a result  dyes and pigment sales declined percent 
while sales in were negatively impacted by falling prices from competitive pressure  the sales decline in came principally from reductions in unit volume in most of the product groups 
however  these reductions were primarily from reduced activity by existing customers experiencing weak demand for their products  and not from a loss of market share 
the decline in dyes and pigments sales was partially offset by a percent increase in specialty chemical sales 
on october   the company acquired mc which produces and sells specialty chemical products to the textile  chemical  paper and metals industries 
specialty sales  without mc sales for the last two months of  increased percent 
the decline in operating profit came entirely from dyes and pigments as overhead costs reduced profitability due to lower volumes 
specialty chemicals contributed substantially to operating income in mc did not have a material effect on operating income for the year or fourth quarter of selling and administrative expenses declined slightly as lower profit based incentives and sales commissions more than offset the selling and administra tive costs of mc after the acquisition

current conditions and outlook metals segment operating income in the fourth quarter surged upward percent to  from the depressed year earlier level when rapidly decreasing sales prices led to significant inventory losses 
sales were up percent to  with much higher volume in piping systems and process equipment offsetting lower sales of stainless pipe 
this change in product mix resulted in higher average selling prices which more than offset an percent decline in overall unit volumes 
pipe unit volume sales were down about percent compared to both the fourth quarter of last year and this year s third quarter 
management believes the decline was primarily the result of distributors desire to reduce inventories in an environment of weak prices 
the continued downward trend in material costs and selling prices coupled with the decrease in pipe unit volume experienced in the fourth quarter of  make the outlook for the metals segment uncertain 
the backlog for piping systems and process equipment was  at year end compared to and year end amounts of  and  respectively 
the chemicals segment performed well in the fourth quarter with operating income up percent to  on an percent increase in sales to  the sales increase resulted from an additional month s sales in from mc  as well as increases in both textile dyes and pigments and chem ical specialties 
profits from dyes and pigments increased modestly while chemical specialties provided the bulk of the income growth 
over the past two years  the company has successfully reduced costs of certain dyes which makes these products more competitive 
as a result there has been an increase in unit volumes for these dyes 
however  there continues to be significant competitive pressure on dyes and pigments prices and overall demand continues to be weak 
the addition of mc has enhanced sales and earnings of the specialty chemicals area as the company is continuing to focus on expanding these products 
several specialty chemicals products have operated at a high level of production over the past two years  but because of the uncertainty of customer scheduling of these products  it is difficult to predict future production levels and their impact on quarterly earnings
