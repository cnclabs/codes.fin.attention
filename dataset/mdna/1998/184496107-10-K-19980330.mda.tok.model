item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to the revenue decline was the result of industry wide pricing pressures and a decrease in the volumes of waste which were processed through the company s facilities 
there are many factors which have impacted  and continue to impact  the company s revenues 
these factors include competitive industry pricing  continued efforts by generators of hazardous waste to reduce the amount of hazardous waste they produce  significant consolidation among treatment and disposal companies  industry wide overcapacity  direct shipment by generators of waste to the ultimate treatment or disposal location  and seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities 
the company continues to take pricing actions in response to industry conditions  as it attempts to maintain a competitive mix of price  performance  and customer support services while attempting to return to profitability and growth 
the company attempts to mitigate the effects of price reductions by reducing operating costs 
there can be no assurance that pricing actions will be effective in stimulating higher levels of sales or that cost reduction efforts will offset the effect of pricing actions on the company s gross margin 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were  in   in and  in one of the largest components of cost of revenues is the cost of sending waste to other companies for disposal 
the company has been able to upgrade the quality and efficiency of its waste treatment services through the development of new technology  strategic acquisitions  and continued modifications and upgrades at its facilities 
during the second quarter of  the company acquired an incinerator in kimball  nebraska which provides the company with incineration capabilities  thus reducing reliance on third parties 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  was in  in and in disposal costs as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the cost of sending waste to third parties decreased by for the year ended as compared to the year ended  however  as a percentage of revenues  there was a slight increase from to due to revenue declines related to pricing being greater than the cost reductions achieved relating to outside disposal 
similarly  other costs of revenues decreased by from to  however  as a percentage of revenues  the decline was less due to revenue decreases due to pricing 
the cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  for as compared to is comprised of a decrease in outside disposal costs to from and an increase in other costs to from 
the company attributes the decrease in outside disposal costs to the addition of the kimball incinerator  which allowed the company to dispose of waste internally that had previously been sent to third parties 
the increase in other costs from to is primarily due to the full year operating cost of the kimball facility in  versus a partial year in  since the incinerator was acquired in the second quarter of in  the company started implementation of its cleanexpress registered trademark system 
the implementation of this system will continue into the company believes that the cleanexpress registered trademark system has resulted in  and will continue to result in  increased efficiencies relative to the collection  transportation  treatment and disposal of routinely created hazardous waste through its expanded and upgraded chicago facility 
the nonrecurring charge of  in resulted primarily from the reengineering program  which identified more efficient methods of servicing customers  as well as certain assets and field locations which were no longer integral to the company s operations 
the company significantly reduced its cost structure 
the reengineering and cost control efforts identified over  in annual cost reductions  which were substantially realized in these savings  which were achieved in part through the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued introduction of new computer systems  strengthened the company s business processes  allowed disposition of non core assets  and reduced the number of offices and the amount of rented space 
although the company realized these savings during  they were offset by reduction in pricing  lower volumes and other costs increasing 
during  the company continued its process of consolidating common functions to reduce redundant costs and improve the company s ability to deliver its services 
the company believes that its ability to continue to manage operating costs is an important factor in its ability to remain price competitive 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s efforts to manage future operating expenses will be successful 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined to  in from  in and  in the decrease from to was caused by a reduction in headcount among the general and administrative employees  and a reduction in virtually all other components of general and administrative expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in selling expense due to the expansion in the sales force and an increase in royalty expense related to kimball plant volumes 
the company plans to continue to reduce costs in  however  no assurance can be given that this objective will be accomplished 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was the result of several cost cutting measures such as reducing administrative staff  relocating the company s corporate headquarters to a new office park and reducing discretionary spending 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during to  from  in and  in the slight increase in interest expense in as compared to is due to higher interest rates on some debt in as compared to  which was partially offset by a reduction in the average debt outstanding in as compared to the increase in interest expense from to is due to an increase in the average borrowings of approximately  for the twelve months ended december  a portion of the increase in interest expense during and was offset by interest income from restricted investments of  in and  in no interest was capitalized during  or other income 
during the first quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax gain  net of related legal fees  of  resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit 
income taxes 
in  income tax expense of  was recorded on a pre tax loss of  for an effective tax rate of  as compared to tax benefits that were recorded on the pre tax losses of and for the years ended and  respectively 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when  based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence  there is a likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and  in  based on this review  the valuation allowance was increased by  which resulted in a non cash charge to operations of the same amount 
this increase in the valuation allowance was the primary reason for the change in the effective tax rate between and the actual realization of the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets depend on having future taxable income of the appropriate character prior to their expiration under the tax laws 
if the company continues to report losses in the future  no income tax benefit for these losses would be recorded 
if the company reports earnings from operations in the future  and depending on the level of these earnings  some portion or all of the valuation reserve would be reversed  which would increase net income reported in future periods 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the fluctuation in the effective tax rate from to was due to the amount of income before taxes  as compared to the fixed amount of goodwill and other non deductible items 
during the ordinary course of its business  the company is audited by federal and state tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments 
the company has received a notice of intent to assess state income taxes from one of the states in which it operates 
the case is currently undergoing administrative appeal 
if the company loses the administrative appeal  the company may be required to make a payment of approximately  to the state 
the company believes that it has properly reported its state income and intends to contest the assessment vigorously 
while the company believes that the final outcome of the dispute will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations  no assurance can be given as to the final outcome of the dispute  the amount of any final adjustments or the potential impact of such adjustments on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  the company and employees acting on behalf of the company make forward looking statements concerning the expected revenues  results of operations  capital expenditures  capital structure  plans and objectives of management for future operations  and future economic performance 
this report contains forward looking statements 
there are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forward looking statement  and there can be no assurance that such expectations will be realized 
the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors  including the company s ability to integrate successfully the cleanexpress registered trademark program  continue to implement the treatment and disposal reengineering program  utilize its facilities and workforce profitably  in the face of intense price competition  maintain or increase market share in an industry which appears to be downsizing and consolidating  realize benefits from cost reduction programs  and generate incremental volumes of waste to be handled through its facilities from existing sales offices and service centers 
the future operating results of the kimball incinerator may be affected by factors such as its ability to obtain sufficient volumes of waste at prices which produce revenue sufficient to offset the operating costs of the facility  minimize downtime and disruptions of operations  and compete successfully against other incinerators which have an established share of the incineration market 
the company s operations may be affected by the commencement and completion of major site remediation projects  cleanup of major spills or other events  seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities  the timing of regulatory decisions relating to hazardous waste management projects  changes in regulations governing the management of hazardous waste  secular changes in the waste processing industry towards waste minimization and the propensity for delays in the remedial market  suspension of governmental permits  and fines and penalties for noncompliance with the myriad of regulations governing the company s diverse operations 
as a result of these factors  the company s revenue and income could vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance 
typically during the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for environmental remediation due to the cold weather  particularly in the northeast and midwest regions  and increased possibility of unplanned weather related plant shutdowns 
in addition  customer factory closings for the year end holidays reduce the volume of industrial waste generated  which results in lower volumes of waste handled by the company during the first quarter of the following year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company participates in a highly volatile industry  with multiple competitors  the major ones of which have taken large write offs and asset write downs and undergone major restructurings during the past several years 
periodically  the company reviews long lived assets for financial impairment 
at the end of  the company determined based on this review that no asset write downs were required  however  if conditions in the industry deteriorate further  certain assets could be determined to be impaired and an asset write off could be required 
also  industry conditions may result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price  as well as that of its competitors 
in the third quarter of the company joined an ongoing lawsuit against the city of chicago challenging the imposition of a waste charge by the city of chicago on every gallon of waste received at the company s chicago facility 
the city charge being challenged is imposed on only two facilities in the city of chicago  the company s facility and a facility operated by liquid recovery systems  inc lrs  which is a co plaintiff in the suit 
since the company has paid approximately  to the city pursuant to this charge and continues to pay an average of approximately  per month 
the lawsuit challenges the legal authority of the city of chicago to impose the charge 
the company contends the charge is  among other things  an unlawful tax on service occupations in violation of the illinois constitution 
the company is seeking a declaration by the circuit court of cook county that the challenged charge is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful  an injunction against the city s continued assessment and collection of the charge and  a refund of all charges paid plus interest 
the city of chicago is vigorously defending its purported authority to collect the charge and asserting that the company is not entitled to a refund 
the company expects the court to rule in on several pending motions filed by the company  including a motion for partial summary judgment that is dispositive of the substantive merits of the company s claims 
the company cannot predict when or whether the court will decide in the company s favor 
accordingly  no account receivable has been recorded on the books of the company relating to this lawsuit 
environmental contingencies while increasing environmental regulation often presents new business opportunities to the company  it likewise often results in increased operating and compliance costs 
the company strives to conduct its operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including environmental rules and regulations  and has as its goal compliance 
this effort requires programs to promote compliance  such as training employees and customers  purchasing health and safety equipment  and in some cases hiring outside consultants and lawyers 
even with these programs  management believes that in the ordinary course of doing business  companies in the environmental services and waste disposal industry are faced with governmental enforcement proceedings resulting in fines or other sanctions and will likely be required to pay civil penalties or to expend funds for remedial work on waste management facilities 
from time to time  the company has paid fines or penalties in governmental environmental enforcement proceedings  usually involving its waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
at december   however  there were no pending governmental environmental enforcement proceedings where the company believes potential monetary sanctions will exceed  the possibility always exists that substantial expenditures could result from governmental proceedings  which would have a negative impact on earnings for a particular reporting period 
more importantly  federal  state and local regulators have the power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for operation of the company s plants  equipment  and vehicles  based on the company s compliance record  and customers may decide not to use a particular disposal facility or do business with a company because of concerns about the compliance record 
suspension or revocation of permits or licenses would impact the company s operations and could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain company subsidiaries have transported or generated waste sent to sites  which have been designated state or federal superfund sites 
as a result  the company has been named as a potentially responsible party at state and federal superfund sites 
eleven of these sites involve two subsidiaries which the company acquired from chemical waste management  inc chemwaste  a wholly owned subsidiary of wmx technologies  inc  and one site involves a subsidiary  which the company acquired from southdown  inc  a public company 
as part of these acquisitions  chemwaste and southdown  inc agreed to indemnify the company with respect to any liability of such subsidiaries for waste disposed of before the company acquired them 
with respect to the other superfund sites  the company has established reserves or escrows  which it believes are appropriate  such that any future settlement costs of lawsuits arising from any or all of the superfund sites are not expected to be material to the company s operations or financial position 
the company had accrued environmental costs of approximately  and  for cleanup of superfund sites  at december  and  respectively 
the company operates facilities that are subject to rcra regulation 
under rcra  every facility that treats  stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a rcra permit from epa or an authorized state agency and must comply with certain operating requirements 
of the company s waste management facilities  nine are subject to rcra licensing 
rcra requires that permits contain a schedule of required on site study and cleanup activities  known as corrective action  including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility 
the epa or applicable state agency have begun rcra corrective action investigations at the company s rcra licensed facilities in baltimore  maryland  chicago  illinois  braintree  massachusetts  natick  massachusetts  woburn  massachusetts  and cincinnati  ohio 
rcra corrective action at the bristol  connecticut  facility was completed in the company is also involved in site studies at its non rcra facilities in cleveland  ohio  kingston  massachusetts  and south portland  maine 
in january  the company entered into a definitive agreement with chemwaste to lease a site previously leased by chemwaste which adjoins the company s chicago facility 
during november  the company acquired the existing improvements on the chemwaste site in exchange for agreeing to share the costs of dismantling an existing hazardous waste incinerator and cleaning up the site 
the improvements on the chemwaste site allowed the company to implement the cleanexpress registered trademark program 
under the sharing arrangement with chemwaste  the company will manage the rcra corrective action investigation at the site and over a period of years could be required to contribute up to a maximum of  for dismantling and decontaminating the incinerator and other equipment and up to a maximum of  for studies and cleanup of the site 
any additional costs beyond those contemplated by the sharing arrangement during this time period would be borne by chemwaste 
the company had accrued  relating to this liability at december  and in addition  the company believes that it would be able to appropriately capitalize the remediation expenditures that it may be obligated to make under the agreement 
no estimate can be made as to when the remediation activities will be complete 
two rcra facilities in bristol  connecticut and cincinnati  ohio were acquired from a subsidiary of southdown  inc southdown has agreed to indemnify the company against any costs incurred or liability arising from contamination on site arising from prior ownership  including corrective action 
the following table summarizes non reimbursed environmental remediation expenditures capitalized and expenses incurred relating to the company s facilities for the years ended december  in thousands environmental expenditures capitalized environmental expenses incurred item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company expects environmental remediation expenditures of the magnitude incurred for the last three years to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company is also involved in a rcra corrective action investigation at a site in chester  pennsylvania owned by peco energy company peco 
the site consists of approximately acres which peco had leased to various companies over the years 
in  the company acquired by merger a public company named chemclear inc  which operated a hazardous waste treatment facility on approximately eight acres of the chester site leased from peco 
the company ceased operations at the chester site  decontaminated the plant and equipment  engaged an independent engineer to certify closure  and obtained final closure of the facility 
in  the epa ordered peco to perform a rcra corrective action investigation at the chester site 
peco asked the company to participate in the site studies  and in october  the company agreed to be responsible for seventy five percent of the cost of these studies  which is estimated to be in the range of  by  among other things  performing field service work and analytical services required to complete the site studies and providing other environmental services to peco at discounted rates 
the company had provided discounts and credits to peco in the amount of  and  through december  and  respectively 
the company had  and  accrued relating to this liability at december  and remediation at this site is expected to be complete in one year 
while the final scope of work to be performed at these sites has not yet been agreed upon  the company believes  based upon information known to date about the nature and extent of contamination at these sites  that accruals have been established when required and such costs are not expected to have a material effect on its results of operations or its competitive position  and that it will be able to finance from operating revenue any additional corrective action required at the sites 
liquidity and capital resources federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat  store  or dispose of hazardous waste  and financial assurance that funds will be available for closure of these facilities  should a facility cease operation  and post closure coverage where required by law 
in  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company pursuant to the federal risk retention act of this company qualifies as a licensed insurance company and is authorized to write closure  professional liability  and pollution liability insurance for the company and its operating subsidiaries 
investments are held by the captive insurance company as assets against its insured liabilities and are restricted for future payment of insurance claims 
in  the company replaced a portion of the closure insurance issued by its captive insurance company with bonds issued by a bonding company 
this allowed the captive insurance company to remit funds previously classified as restricted cash to the company 
in addition  at december   the company had on deposit collateral of  with a commercial insurance company to provide for closure and post closure costs of its incinerator and landfill 
during  the company renegotiated its agreement with the insurance company to replace collateral with a letter of credit

in september of  the company refinanced its  revolving credit and term loan agreement the loan agreement with a financial institution by i amending the loan agreement to reduce the maximum credit thereunder from  to  and ii guaranteeing  of economic development revenue bonds due september  issued by the city of kimball  nebraska the bonds 
the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds to repay a portion of its outstanding debt under the loan agreement 
that portion was originally incurred to pay for a portion of the costs of the kimball incinerator and landfill  including the prepaid closure insurance programs  as well as the costs of improvements to the facility
