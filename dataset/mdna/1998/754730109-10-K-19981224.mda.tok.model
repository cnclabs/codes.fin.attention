fiscal years and were record years for equity underwriting activity  both in number of new issues and average offering size 
this pace continued only through the first half of fiscal  at which time small and mid cap stocks began to weaken  particularly in certain industry sectors  which slowed and eventually curtailed the new issue deal flow

administrative and benefit compensation costs have been increasing at a rate consistent with the growth in total revenues 
the total number of employees has increased over in the past three years  with the most significant increase occurring in the information systems area 
incentive compensation expenses are based on departmental  subsidiary and firm wide profitability 
record underwriting activity in resulted in a dramatic increase in investment banking departmental profits  having a significant impact on incentive compensation 
these revenues and the related incentive compensation were basically flat from to the continuing increases in communications and information processing expense in fiscal and reflect the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the company s systems of internal communication and information dissemination  as well as higher general business volume which gave rise to increased costs for telephone  printing and supplies 
the completion and occupancy of the third headquarters building in the spring of gave rise to much of the increased occupancy and equipment expenses for that year 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expense from fiscal to is predominantly the increased depreciation on additional information processing equipment  as well as expenses associated with upgraded retail office space and financial advisor workstations over the past two years 
clearing and floor brokerage expense has not increased in proportion to related revenues due to the increased productivity of floor brokers and other cost saving measures implemented over the period 
business development expenses rose dramatically in due to increased advertising  both to recruit financial advisors and increase brand name recognition  increased travel and related expenses  particularly by the larger staff of investment bankers and research analysts  the inception of the stadium naming rights contract  and costs associated with larger conferences throughout the company s operations 
the increase in was proportionate to the increase in total revenues and reflects the growth of most of the same items

these expenses include fees paid to outside managers in the company s investment advisory services program  bank service charges  legal expenses and provisions  and various state taxes
