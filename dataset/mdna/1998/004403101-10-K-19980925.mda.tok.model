the company also signed a five year agreement with travelers express  effective in april  to offer an electronic bill payment service to the company s customers 
in conjunction with these two agreements  the company received million from travelers express in april and is entitled to receive an additional  per year for the next five years 
the million payment was deferred and included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total million from travelers express will be amortized on a straight line basis over the five year term of the agreements beginning january new credit facilities in july  the company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the lenders represented by wells fargo bank texas  national association wells fargo bank  as lead agent and chase bank of texas as co agent the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for credit facilities to the company that are available only upon the expiration or termination of the existing money order agreement with the money order supplier  which is currently expected to be january  the contemplated credit facilities consist of a revolving line of credit facility of million the revolving facility and a term loan facility of million the term loan facility 
the revolving facility is to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the company  and the term loan facility is to be used for store construction and relocation and other capital expenditures of the company  including acquisitions 
also  upon certain conditions  the company will have available from wells fargo bank i an additional ten day revolving advance facility of up to million  in addition to the revolving facility  and ii a standby letter of credit facility of up to million 
the revolving facility will in effect replace the deferred money order remittances and revolving advances now obtained and used by the company under the existing money order agreement  and the term loan facility will in effect replace the term advance facility under the existing money order agreement 
the company expects to borrow under the credit agreement  upon the availability of the facilities  to refinance the outstanding borrowings from the money order supplier and to discharge the company s obligations to pay money order proceeds to the money order supplier under the existing money order agreement 
the total amount of funds available under the revolving facility may not exceed the company s cash balances and cash equivalents including checks cashed by the company that are being processed for payment 
the revolving facility will be available to the company for days after july   and all unpaid principal and accrued interest under the revolving facility will then be due 
the term loan facility will be available to the company for one year after july   and all amounts outstanding under the term loan facility at that date will be payable over the succeeding four years  principal will be payable quarterly based on a four year straight line amortization 
borrowings under the revolving facility will bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s discretion  either the prime rate publicly announced by wells fargo bank the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus

there can be no assurance  however  that the anticipated renewal will be effected 
if no such renewal is effected  the company will have to obtain financing from other sources  and that financing might be on terms less favorable to the company than those set forth in the credit agreement for the revolving facility 
the company believes that other sources of financing would be available to it if necessary  however  if the company were unable to obtain financing from one or more other sources  the company s liquidity and operations would be materially and adversely affected

the company s payment and performance of its obligations under the credit agreement and ancillary documents will be secured by liens on all its assets 
the collateral arrangements will be subject to the amended and restated collateral trust agreement dated as of july  the amended collateral trust agreement that was signed with the credit agreement 
the amended collateral trust agreement will amend and supersede the existing collateral trust agreement dated as of november   entered into at the time of the note purchase agreement with principal 
the amended collateral trust agreement will create a collateral trust  with wilmington trust company as trustee  to secure the company s obligations under the credit agreement and to the company s two other secured lenders  principal and travelers express 
the amended collateral trust agreement includes agreements regarding the priority of distributions to the secured lenders upon foreclosure and liquidation of the collateral subject thereto and certain other intercreditor arrangements 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs that use two digits instead of four to record the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year instead of the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other events  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company currently believes that  based on a recent internal assessment of its technology infrastructure  the company will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software or hardware so that its computer systems will properly recognize dates beyond december  the company also believes that its software and hardware with the year issue can be modified or replaced with upgraded or new software at a cost that will not be material to the company s operations or financial condition 
further  the company does not believe that its operations have been or will be disrupted to any material extent by the year issue with its existing software or hardware or by its activities to address the year issue 
the company believes that it has identified the most significant pieces of its software and items of its hardware with the year issue  that software includes portions of its accounting software and data processing software for the company s as computer 
however  the company believes that modifications or replacements for that software or to that hardware are readily available in the marketplace or from suppliers of that software to the company 
the company has begun to schedule the processes to modify or replace as the case may be that software and hardware 
the company plans to use its own personnel  consultants  and resources and the personnel of its software suppliers to modify or replace software and hardware 
the company plans to complete the necessary modification and replacement of its software and hardware to address the year issue by the end of fiscal the company has contacted its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s plans to address the year issue  as well as the estimated cost to address it stated below  include the estimated time and cost associated with the impact of such other parties year issues  based on currently available information 
however  the company s information in this regard is not necessarily complete 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies with which the company s systems interface will be timely converted if necessary  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not require the company to spend more time or money than estimated  or even have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company estimates that the total cost of addressing its year issue will be approximately million excluding the compensation cost of its existing technology personnel  which would have been incurred anyway 
that estimated cost  as well as the company s existing plans to address the year issue  are based on various assumptions  including the availability of internal and external technological resources and other parties software modification plans 
there can be no guarantee that this estimate and these plans will be achieved  however 
specific factors that might cause actual results to differ include  but are not necessarily limited to  the availability and cost of technology personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
operating trends seasonality the company s business is seasonal to the extent of the impact of cashing tax refund checks and two other tax related services electronic tax filing and processing applications for refund anticipation loans 
the impact of these services is in the third and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
impact of inflation management believes that the company s results of operations are not dependent upon the levels of inflation
