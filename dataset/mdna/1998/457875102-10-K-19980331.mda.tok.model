the discussion in this section contains forward looking information that is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  expressed or implied by such forward looking information 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results below and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
among these risks are legislative acts  weather conditions  changes in the market value of salvage  outcome of litigation  competition  quality and quantity of inventory available from suppliers  and dependence on key insurance company suppliers 
overview the company offers insurance companies and other vehicle suppliers cost effective salvage processing solutions through a variety of different methods of sale  including fixed fee consignment  purchase agreement and percentage of sale consignment 
under the purchase agreement sales method  the vehicle is owned by the company and the sales price of the vehicle is recorded in revenue 
under the fixed fee and percentage of sale consignment sales methods  the vehicle is not owned by the company and only the fees associated with the processing and sale of the vehicle are recorded in net sales 
by assuming some of the risk inherent in owning the salvage vehicle instead of selling on a consignment basis  the company is potentially able to increase profits by improving the value of the salvage vehicle prior to the sale 
under the purchase agreement method  iaa generally pays the insurance company a pre determined percentage of the actual cash value acv to purchase the vehicle  pursuant to the purchase agreement 
acvs are the estimated pre accident fair value of a vehicle  adjusted for additional equipment  mileage and other factors 
until the significant rise in used car prices and acvs during  the conversion from consignment sales to purchase agreement sales generally benefited the company 
during  however  used car prices and acvs rose significantly 
despite the increase in used car prices and acvs  prices at salvage auctions did not increase correspondingly 
because the company s purchase price is fixed by contract  the increased acvs can and has reduced profitability on the sale of vehicles under the purchase agreement method 
the company has renegotiated some of its purchase agreement contracts and seeks to renegotiate certain others 
if the relationship between acvs and salvage prices remains at its present level  the company may continue to encounter reduced profitability from purchase agreement contracts until they expire or are renegotiated 
the company continues to offer purchase agreements to those customers who select it  but generally at a lower percentage of acv than previously offered to customers  based on current vehicle values 
the company has added adjustment and risk sharing clauses to its new standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship 
since its initial public offering  the company has grown primarily through a series of acquisitions to now include locations as of december  in february of  the company acquired auto disposal company  inc adc operated two pools in alabama 
the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations  including quarterly fluctuations  that can result from a number of factors  some of which are more significant for sales under the purchase agreement method
