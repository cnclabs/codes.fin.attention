item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and the related financial data are presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of first commonwealth financial corporation including its subsidiaries the corporation for the years ended december   and and are intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
important factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
during the fourth quarter of the corporation formed first commonwealth insurance agency fcia as a subsidiary of the corporation s commercial banking subsidiary 
this new company will market a wide range of insurance and annuity products to the corporation s retail and commercial customers beginning january  the corporation acquired bsi financial services inc bsi effective april  the bsi merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction  whereby the results of operations of bsi from the date of acquisition are included in the corporation s financial statements 
results of operations net income in was million  an increase of million from the level of million and compared to million reported in basic earnings per share increased per share in to 
the increase in net income and basic earnings per share for was primarily the result of increases in net interest income and securities gains which were partially offset by increases in the provision for possible credit losses and employee costs when compared to levels 
the increase in basic earnings per share of generated during reflected increases in net interest income and securities gains as well as increases due to the inclusion of bsi income in loan origination and servicing revenue and increases in charge card user fees 
net income and basic earnings per share for were negatively impacted by increases in occupancy and furniture and equipment costs and equipment maintenance and repairs

net income per share  prior year increase decrease from changes in net interest income provision for possible credit losses security transactions other income salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment costs fdic expense other expenses provision for income taxes net income per share net interest income  the most significant component of earnings  is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds interest expense on liabilities 
net interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the following is an analysis of the average balance sheets and net interest income for each of the three years in the period ended december  first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis average balance sheets and net interest analysis dollar amounts in thousands average income yield or average income yield or average income yield or balance expense rate a balance expense rate a balance expense rate a assets interest earning assets time deposits with banks    investment securities       federal funds sold    loans b c  net of unearned income       total interest earning assets       noninterest earning assets cash    allowance for credit losses    other assets    total noninterest earning assets    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits d       savings deposits d       time deposits       short term borrowings       long term debt      total interest bearing liabilities       noninterest bearing liabilities and capital noninterest bearing demand deposits d    other liabilities    shareholders equity    total noninterest bearing funding sources    total liabilities and shareholders equity    net interest income and net yield on interest earning assets    a yields on interest earning assets have been computed on a tax equivalent basis using the federal income tax statutory rate 
b income on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis  and the loan balances are included in interest earning assets 
c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances for do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis both interest income and interest expense increased over levels as volumes increased 
average interest earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million in average loans increased million in and were supported by deposit growth and maturities of investment securities 
asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points during while asset yields decreased basis points during the decline in loan yields which began in the fourth quarter of has continued throughout and loan yields declined basis points during to from reported for and compared to during the period reflected decreased yields in all loan categories except revolving credit loans which reflected an increase of basis points over levels 
the decline in loan yields included declines of basis points for mortgage loans  basis points for installment loans and basis points for municipal loans 
municipal loan yields declined as most of the municipal growth for was in short term tax anticipation notes 
the mortgage portfolio continues to be impacted by loans maturing at higher interest rates than current market rates and innovative loan product offerings which bear lower introductory interest rates 
these loan products are designed to initiate relationships in the early stages of a customer s financial life cycle so they may be developed thereafter with more traditional banking products and services 
any initial earnings reduction related to new products are expected to produce long term profitable relationships and loan yields 
loan yields on products introduced during the fourth quarter of began improving in the fourth quarter of and are expected to continue improving during although loan yields declined during  interest income on loans increased million over levels as a result of increases due to volume of million which were partially offset by decreases due to rate of million 
interest income on investments increased thousand during and reflected increases due to rate of thousand which were partially offset by decreases due to volume of thousand 
the yield on investments of for was an increase of basis point over yields of 
the investment rate increases for occurred primarily in investments of us government agency securities 
although prepayments of mortgage backed securities mbs increased during over levels  these prepayments have not increased beyond acceptable levels 
the primary risk of owning mbs relates to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayment speeds generally decline  resulting in a longer average life of a mbs 
conversely as interest rates decline  prepayment speeds increase  resulting in a shorter average life of a mbs 
using computer simulation models  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbs s under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
the cost of funds for increased basis points over costs of and compared to costs of for interest on deposits increased million in and included increases due to volume of million and increases due to rate of million 
the cost of deposits increased basis points during  including increases on total savings deposits of basis points which can primarily be attributable to increased utilization by customers of new savings products bearing higher interest rates than standard savings accounts 
these new savings products have been designed to build long term customer relationships and are intended to produce a favorable impact on the corporation s net interest margin over the long term 
interest expense on time deposits increased million during primarily as a result of volume increases in time deposits with maturities of to years and time deposits greater than thousand which increased million and million  respectively over averages 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued increases in interest expense on short term borrowings of thousand and interest expense on long term debt of million during were primarily a result of increases in average borrowings of million and million respectively over averages 
borrowings during were part of a leveraging strategy intended to create an increase to net interest margin over the life of the investments 
net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets  was during compared to in and in the corporation s use of computer modeling to manage interest rate risk is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion herein 
the following table shows the effect of changes in volumes and rates on interest income and interest expense

the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for possible credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in the provision for possible credit losses increased in as a result of an increase in charge offs  combined with growth in the portfolio as a whole during net charge offs for reflected increases in consumer installment and revolving credit loans of million  loans secured by residential real estate of thousand and commercial loans not secured by real estate of thousand 
major components of the increase in net charge offs of loans to individuals were increases in charge offs of indirect auto loans and unsecured loans 
it is anticipated that charge offs for these categories will decline in future periods  but remain above historic levels because of continued growth in these areas 
net charge offs against the allowance for possible credit losses were million  or of average total loans in this compared to million in and net charge offs were and of average total loans during and  respectively 
although the allowance for possible credit losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding is below peer averages net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding has historically been at  or below peer averages 
the peer group was defined using the uniform bank performance report published by the federal financial institutions examination council

first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the following table presents an analysis of the consolidated allowance for possible credit losses for the five years ended december  dollars in thousands summary of loan loss experience loans outstanding at end of year      average loans outstanding      allowance for possible credit losses balance  beginning of year      loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural    loans to individuals      real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total loans charged off      recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural loans to individuals real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total recoveries   net loans charged off      provision charged to expense      balance  end of year      ratios net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding allowance for possible credit losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding total other operating income increased million in to million from million reported in compared to million in net securities gains were million in compared to securities gains of million during and securities losses of thousand in the securities gains during and resulted primarily from the sale of investments in pennsylvania bank stocks classified as equity securities available for sale 
these equity securities had book values of million and million and were sold for gains of million and million during and respectively 
the securities losses during resulted from the sale of million of securities  primarily us treasury securities classified as available for sale having an average yield of and an average remaining life of about months 
the proceeds from the sale of these us treasury securities were used to pay off short term borrowings costing 
this transaction resulted in a net improvement in net interest income over the remaining life of the securities in excess of the net loss on the sale 
trust income reflected an increase in of thousand over levels as the book value of assets managed continued to increase 
the increase in trust income occurred primarily in fees from employee benefit accounts  estates and agency custodial accounts 
service charges on deposits decreased by thousand during but are expected to increase during as standardized fee schedules implemented during generate results 
service charges on deposits increased during  primarily as a result of increased average total deposits 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis other income increased thousand in to million from million reported in and can be compared to million in other revenue continued to be favorably impacted by charge card user fees which increased thousand during and thousand during these fee increases resulted from the introduction of redesigned charge card products during which generated over a fifty percent increase in the number of accounts and balances outstanding during and continued to show strong growth during charges for non customer use of the corporation s atms instituted in november of increased other income for by thousand and are anticipated to generate additional increases for other income for also included an increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance of thousand related to the last two months of the year 
other revenue for will reflect increases from insurance commissions as fcia begins operations in january 
other revenue for included decreases of thousand in gains on sale of assets 
the inclusion of bsi income on loan origination and servicing for  increased other income by thousand 
total other operating expenses increased million to million in and compared to million and million in and  respectively 
employee costs during were million  an increase of million over the level of million 
decreases in deferred loan origination costs increased employee costs for by thousand while changes in unemployment compensation resulted in increases of thousand 
inclusion of bsi for twelve months of increased employee costs by thousand during while inclusion of bsi for eight months in the period resulted in an increase of thousand during included in employee costs for were early retirement settlements and other benefit adjustments of million 
the period also reflected an increase in the employer s matching contribution for the corporation s k plan to of the amount contributed by the employee  up from in conversion to a managed health care plan effective january  resulted in decreases of thousand for compared to levels and reflected minimal increases for of after excluding the effect of bsi on the period 
health insurance costs are expected to experience a rate increase during although employee costs in dollars increased  employee costs as a percentage of average assets declined to for from in and in salary levels are generally maintained through attrition management programs 
net occupancy and furniture and equipment costs increased thousand during and thousand during net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense reflected increases in building rental expense  building repairs  and depreciation during these increases were primarily the result of the construction of new branches during and as well as remodeling of existing branches 
the cost of equipment maintenance contracts and equipment repairs decreased thousand during and increased thousand during net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment increased thousand in as a result of increased utilization of leased equipment during the redesign of various operational areas of the organization such as loan processing 
fdic expenses decreased for all periods presented including decreases of thousand for and million for both the and periods include adjustments to the corporation s federal deposit insurance costs 
the period includes an additional one time assessment against the corporation s thrift deposits of thousand to replenish the savings and loan insurance fund saif 
the related period includes a rebate of million of deposit insurance costs to the corporation s commercial banking subsidiaries as a result of the federal deposit insurance corporation s bank insurance fund bif reaching its regulatory cap 
the merger of corporation s thrift subsidiary and the corporation s commercial banking subsidiary during will result in a tiered fdic rate for deposits in future periods  as the saif rate will apply to deposits of the savings bank at the merger date and bif rates will apply to new deposits of all partner banks 
it is anticipated that beginning in the year that the tiered rate structure will disappear when banks and thrifts pay on equal rate 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis other operating expenses remained stable for with a reduction of thousand from million reported in and can be compared to million in the inclusion of bsi accounted for thousand of the increase for telephone costs continued to increase reflecting increases of thousand for and thousand for these cost increases may continue as high speed data lines are installed to facilitate efficient access to centralized information by the corporation s partner banks 
centralized cost control efforts during were partially responsible for the reduction in outside data processing  printing and insurance costs of thousand  thousand and thousand respectively 
continued strong growth in the loan portfolio during was the primary cause of increases in filing and recording fees of thousand  charge card interchange fees of thousand and collection and repossession expenses of thousand 
marketing expenses remained stable for while aggressive marketing of innovative new products and services resulted in increases of thousand in advertising expenses during additional cost increases during occurred in stationery and supplies  filing and recording fees and pennsylvania shares tax expenses which incurred increases of thousand  thousand and thousand respectively 
other professional fees decreased thousand during after an increase of thousand for as a result of the use of outside consultants to help analyze and implement standardized fee schedules in the period 
income tax expense was million during representing an increase of million over the total of million and compared to million in taxable income increased million and thousand during and respectively  while taxable income decreased million during the corporation s effective tax rate increased to in from in and compares to in liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
increased competition from nonbanking sources such as mutual funds may require banks to shift to alternative funding from other borrowings 
although this is not significant at the end of  it could become more consequential in the future 
deposits increased million in and included million in core deposits 
non core deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december   up from of total deposits at december  non core deposits increased by million in and million in primarily as a result of an increase in public funds 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less    over months through months    over months through months    over months    total    net loans increased million during primarily in the categories of commercial and industrial loans secured by real estate  consumer leases and real estate loans secured by residential properties 
in combination these categories represented over of the loan growth during with of the total loan growth being generated in residential real estate loans 
the growth in residential mortgages can partially be attributed to the outstanding customer response to the corporation s innovative mortgage product designed for first time home buyers which was introduced during the fourth quarter of the growth in consumer leases during can partially be attributed to continued growth in the corporation s dealer services programs which began in may and offers in addition to indirect loans  a competitive flexlease product 
below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction      real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      net leases      gross loans and leases      unearned income      total loans  and leases net of unearned income      an additional source of liquidity are marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of million first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis and an approximate fair value of million 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were thousand 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity 
below is a schedule of the contractual maturity distribution of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale at december  maturity distribution of securities held to maturity dollar amounts in thousands states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year    after but within years     after but within years    after years    total     maturity distribution of securities available for sale at amortized cost dollar amounts in thousands us treasury  and other states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year   after but within years   after but within years   after years    total    yields are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
interest sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps when measured over a variety of time periods may be helpful 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceeds interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis interest sensitivity continued the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis final loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one one to after year years years total commercial and industrial     financial institutions real estate construction     real estate commercial     other     totals     loans at fixed interest rates   loans at variable interest rates   totals   the corporation has not experienced the kind of earnings volatility indicated from the gap analysis 
this is because assets and liabilities with similar contractual repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest margin  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
assumptions regarding the replacement of maturing assets and liabilities are made to simulate the impact of future changes in rates and or changes in balance sheet composition 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or a lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the effect of changes in future interest rates on the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ from simulated results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide customers with a certain degree of flexibility to respond to economic changes 
this flexibility would enable customers to shift from lower cost deposit products to higher cost products or to refinance loans as interest rates decrease 
while the corporation s simulation analysis considers these factors  the extent to which customers utilize their investment and borrowing options may cause actual results to differ from the simulation 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point movement in interest rates in either direction would not have a significant impact on the corporation s anticipated net interest income over the next twelve months 
credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for possible credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation  and terms 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement  and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card  or revolving credit transactions 
consumer creditworthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources  and past credit history 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for possible credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
however  for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses at december according to the categories indicated allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total      allowance as percentage of average total loans the unallocated portion of the allowance for possible credit losses increased slightly during to of the total allowance from of the total allowance for the corporation has continued to allocate an amount to provide for loan growth and to adjust the allowance for possible credit losses based on comparative peer analysis 
the corporation has defined an adequate base allowance for possible credit losses by comparing the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding to the peer average and has allocated a portion of the allowance to reduce the variance to peer 
net charge offs in both dollars and as a percentage of average loans has increased on an annual basis since december   but historically remain below peer averages 
although the corporation s historic net charge offs as a percentage of average loans remain lower than peer averages  management has deemed it appropriate to allocate a portion of the allowance for possible credit losses to provide for a potential change in the corporation s trend in credit loss experience equal to peers  rather than continuation of the historic trend which has been favorable in comparison to peers 
other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis nonperforming and impaired assets and effect on interest income due to nonaccrual dollar amounts in thousands loans on nonaccrual basis      past due loans      renegotiated loans  total nonperforming loans      nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans allowance as percentage of nonperforming loans other real estate owned      gross income that would have been recorded at original rates  interest that was reflected in income net reduction to interest income due to nonaccrual the reduction of income due to renegotiated loans was less than thousand in any year presented 
the corporation s loan portfolio continues to reflect strong growth during while the level of nonperforming loans remains stable in dollar amount when compared to levels 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans is currently at its lowest year end level in over seven years 
at december  the ratio of the reserve for possible credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains lower than the corporation s peers and although this ratio is an indicator of the strength of the reserve for possible credit losses it does not in itself measure reserve adequacy 
other factors to be considered include historical credit losses and nonperforming loan levels 
these measurements were favorable when compared to peer group levels over the past five years 
management believes that the reserve for possible credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital increased million in to million 
dividends declared decreased equity by million  an increase over the period as the dividend rate was increased 
the retained net income remains in permanent capital to fund future growth and expansion 
payments by the corporation s employee stock ownership plan esop to reduce debt it incurred to acquire the corporation s common stock for future distribution as employee compensation  net of additional advances  and fair value adjustments to unearned esop shares  increased equity capital by million 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale increased capital by thousand 
amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends and optional cash payments reduced equity by thousand 
the cost of purchasing treasury shares decreased equity by million while proceeds from the reissuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity capital by thousand during first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis capital resources continued a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
year analysis the year issue is the result of computer programs being written whereby dates have been abbreviated by eliminating the first two digits of the year under the assumption that these two digits would always be any computer systems that have date sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year as the year approaches such systems will be unable to accurately process certain date based information resulting in potential system failure or miscalculations 
the corporation s data processing subsidiary  commonwealth systems corporation  is its greatest asset in minimizing both risks and costs associated with the year issue 
the technical staff began assessing the size and complexity of the problem and identifying hardware and software systems affected by the year issue in based upon this assessment  the corporation has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  in the corporation began an awareness effort to inform the board of directors  senior management and other staff of the year problem and its significance 
during the corporation also began an inventory process and developed a plan for addressing the year issue 
formal communications have been initiated with software vendors to request year compliance certification 
where noncompliant systems are identified the corporation has identified the cost of replacement or modification of these softwares 
some testing or validation began in  however the bulk of the validation will occur in mainframe software systems will be renovated or replaced throughout as the systems are successfully tested 
the corporation has a certification date of december   therefore the majority of the critical mainframe software systems will be implemented by then 
other areas of the corporation utilize a similar framework for evaluating software systems which are unique as well as evaluating significant suppliers and outside professional service contractors to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the corporation s estimate of total year project costs and estimated times for completion are based on presently available information and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the corporation will utilize internal resources to reprogram and test software for year modifications to the extent possible 
internal incremental costs will be expensed as incurred but are not expected to be material 
in addition certain software and hardware has been identified for replacement 
in most cases the new software and hardware will offer additional benefits in processing capability or efficiencies gained from modernization in addition to achieving year compliance 
spreadsheet and loan origination first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis year analysis continued software will be upgraded to more recent software versions and personal computers will be converted to windows operating systems as part of making local area networks year compliant 
mainframe software and hardware replaced will result in enhancements or features of potential benefit in serving banking customers or processing financial transactions 
these expenditures will be capitalized as software and hardware is put into service and the amounts will be amortized over three years for software and five years for hardware 
the cash outlay will be funded through operating cash flows and will occur primarily during the next two years 
as of december   the corporation estimates that expenditures for the year issue will not have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analysis and monitoring of its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
