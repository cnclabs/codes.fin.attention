item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company was organized in to address market opportunities in the area of biological implantable products and materials  and today is the leader in the cryopreservation of viable human tissue for cardiovascular  vascular and orthopaedic applications 
a majority of the company s current revenues are derived from the cryopreservation of human heart valves and conduits  reflecting cryolife s initial exclusive focus on this area 
the company began cryopreserving aortic heart valves in  pulmonary heart valves in and mitral heart valves in cryolife has also expanded into the cryopreservation of other human tissue  including vascular tissue and connective tissue for the knee 
the company pays a fee to an organ procurement agency or tissue bank at the time such organization consigns human tissue to the company 
the company generates revenues from cryopreservation services by charging hospitals a fee  which covers the company s services  the associated procurement fee and applicable shipping expenses 
the company records revenue upon shipping tissue 
costs associated with the procurement  processing and storage of tissue are accounted for as deferred preservation costs on the company s balance sheet and are expensed when the tissue is shipped 
the company continually monitors cryopreserved tissue in its possession to determine its viability 
tissue determined not to be suitable for implantation is disposed of properly  and the associated deferred preservation costs are expensed 
as part of an effort to reduce its working capital needs  while simultaneously facilitating the use of cryopreserved tissue  the company provides liquid nitrogen freezers to a number of hospitals 
the company retains ownership of the liquid nitrogen freezers and  consequently  incurs associated depreciation charges 
the hospitals are responsible for operating expenses related to the use of the liquid nitrogen freezers 
the company has expanded  and intends to continue to expand  its portfolio of products and services 
much of this expansion has been accomplished through acquisitions of intellectual property and companies 
in  the company purchased for  the exclusive distribution rights for a line of stentless porcine heart valves which the company currently markets in the european community 
in  the company purchased for  a patent for an advanced design stentless pulmonary porcine heart valve 
also in  the company acquired the assets of ucfi  a tissue processor  for  in cash and a million note 
in  the company acquired ifm and its line of single use medical devices for million in cash  a million convertible debenture and a commitment to pay additional cash consideration not to exceed million if certain target net revenues of ifm are exceeded 
the composition of the company s revenues is expected to change in future years  reflecting  among other things  the anticipated growth in shipments of human vascular tissue and human connective tissue for the knee  the acquisition of ifm and the introduction into the european community of bioglue surgical adhesive as well as other expected new products

this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of heart allograft shipments 
revenues from human vascular tissue cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such years 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments resulting from the introduction of cryopreserved tissues for new procedures and an increased demand for the company s existing cryopreservation services 
revenues from human connective tissue for the knee cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing of total revenues during each year 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments resulting from a greater proportion of the revenues being derived from the implantation of cryopreserved menisci  which have a significantly higher per unit revenue than the company s cryopreserved tendons 
revenues from the sale of bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices in were  compared to  in  representing of revenues during each year 
other revenues decreased to  in from  in other revenues in consisted primarily of research grant award revenues related to the company s synergraft technology 
cost of cryopreservation services and products increased to million in from million in cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to the increased overhead costs associated with the new corporate headquarters and the addition of the ifm product line  partially offset by efficiencies gained with the increase in the number of allografts processed 
general  administrative and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such years 
the increased expenses of approximately million were primarily attributable to increased costs associated with the company s new corporate headquarters  increased fees paid to technical representatives and other related marketing expenses relating to the growth in revenues and increases in general overhead expenses to support the growth in revenues 
the company has continued its commitment to research and development activity  spending approximately million in and million in  representing of total revenues during each year 
the company s research and development expenditures during were primarily for the development of bioadhesives for surgical applications and its synergraft technology 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to growing acceptance in the medical community of cryopreserved tissues  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue and price increases for certain services 
revenues from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such years

seasonality the demand for the company s human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes that this demand trend for human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months 
management believes that the trends experienced by the company to date for its human connective tissue for the knee cryopreservation services indicate that this business may also be seasonal because it is an elective procedure that may be performed less frequently during the fourth quarter holiday months 
however  the demand for the company s vascular tissue cryopreservation services  bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices and single use medical devices does not appear to experience this seasonal trend 
quarterly results the company achieved record revenues and earnings in both the year and three months ended december   as compared to comparable prior periods  with the fourth quarter of being the company s tenth consecutive quarter of record revenues and earnings as compared to the same quarter for prior years 
in the opinion of management  the information set forth in the table below has been prepared on a basis consistent with the company s audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the form k  and all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period

weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding basic         diluted         liquidity and capital resources at december   net working capital was million  compared to million at december   with a current ratio of to at december  the company s primary capital requirements arise out of general working capital needs  including capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  and funding of research and development projects 
the company historically has funded these requirements through bank credit facilities  cash generated by operations and equity offerings 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from an increase in deferred cryopreservation costs to support the growing acceptance of the company s existing cryopreserved tissues as well as new cryopreserved tissue offerings in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the company s acquisition of ifm 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to borrowings under the company s credit facility in connection with the acquisition of ifm and the construction of the new company and ifm facilities and increased deferred cryopreservation costs 
the company intends to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in connection with a public offering of up to  shares of common stock excluding over allotments the offering 
the company anticipates that  even if the offering is not consummated  borrowings under its existing credit agreements and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and development needs for the next months 
however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements beyond that period will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of the company s receipt of fda approvals to begin clinical trials for its products currently in development  the resources required to further develop its marketing and sales capabilities if  and when  those products gain approval  the resources required to expand manufacturing capacity and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing or will not seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital to meet future requirements 
these additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation although the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation  management does not believe it has had a significant effect on revenues or results of operations and does not expect it to have a significant effect in the near future 
year the company is aware of the issues that many computer systems will face as the millennium year approaches 
the company  however  believes that its own internal software and hardware is year compliant 
the company believes that any year problems encountered by procurement agencies  hospitals and other customers and vendors are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company anticipates no other year problems which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that such problems will not arise
