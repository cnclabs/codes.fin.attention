item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company generates revenues primarily from sales of ivd imaging systems based on its patented and proprietary aim technology 
following the initial sale  these systems become part of the installed base and generate follow on sales of supplies and service necessary for their operation 
the company also generates revenues from sales of ancillary lines of small laboratory instruments and supplies 
until  the company generated most of its revenues from sales of just two models of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation and related supplies and services 
these two models differ mainly by their speed and price 
in  the company introduced a third model of the yellow iris  the model udx urine pathology system which is a higher capacity automated urinalysis workstation designed especially for the high volume testing requirements of large hospitals and reference laboratories 
finally  the company began selling the powergene family of genetic analyzers in august after completing the psi acquisition

results of operations the consolidated financial statements reflect the consummation of the psi acquisition on july  which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations include the financial results of psi for the entire fiscal year  but only for the period from august to december for fiscal comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
sales of ivd imaging systems increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase is due primarily to the addition of the powergene family of genetic analyzers to the company s product line in august as a result of the psi acquisition and increased sales of the yellow iris 
sales of ivd imaging system supplies and services increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  due to the larger installed base of ivd imaging systems and the conversion of the yellow iris installed base to the new chemstrip iristrip urine test strips marketed exclusively by the company 
sales of small instruments and supplies decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or  over the prior year 
the decrease reflects lower sales levels of the statspin products to one of its distributors 
the company believes that the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry may be adversely affecting sales of the yellow iris as some hospitals and reference laboratories appear to be postponing large capital investment decisions due to the resulting uncertainty 
the company also believes that there is a growing trend among potential customers for the yellow iris toward leasing these systems on a cost per test basis rather than purchasing them 
this trend is expected to spread revenue from system placements over several years 
royalties and licensing revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  an increase of  over the prior year 
the increase is primarily the result of increased royalties received  the receipt of previously disputed royalties relating to the fourth quarter of and initial fees earned for the license of certain technology 
amounts are expected to decrease to historical levels in cost of goods for ivd imaging systems as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems was for the year ended december  and is comparable to the prior year 
cost of goods for ivd imaging system supplies and services decreased as a percentage of sales of such products to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
this decrease is principally due to decreased costs and increased sales prices 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies totaled for the year ended december   and is comparable to the prior year

reimbursements under joint development programs decreased to million in from million in total product technology expenditures decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or over the prior year  due primarily to reduced spending on the development of the white iris and decreased expenditures on the poly products  partially offset by the addition of research and development staff from the psi acquisition 
amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of deferred expenses for warrants issued in connection with joint development projects and intangible assets arising from acquisitions and patents 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  increased to million from  an increase of  or over the prior year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of intangible assets in the psi acquisition and a small product line acquisition

the unusual charges in the prior year totaled million and related primarily to the write off of deferred public offering costs  litigation expense  restructuring charges  and merger related expenses 
acquisition of in process research and development charges for the year ended december  amounted to million 
no similar charge occurred in the net result of the above described charges was an increase in operating income in fiscal to  as compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
excluding the effects of the unusual charges and acquisition of in process research and development  operating income would have been million in the current year  compared to an operating loss of million in the previous year 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year  primarily as the result of decreased amounts of invested cash in interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the prior year due to the indebtedness incurred to finance the psi acquisition and increased interest rates on bank debt 
other income increased primarily due to the receipt of government grant funds for reimbursement of expenses incurred in prior periods 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the income tax benefit for the year ended december  differs from the federal statutory rate due to state  local and foreign income taxes and permanent differences between income reported for the financial statement and income tax purposes 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission recently announced a new position on accounting for convertible preferred stock which is potentially convertible at a discount to the market price of the common stock  even if the potential for a discount is only a possibility 
the staff has taken the position that  solely for purposes of calculating earnings per share  the potential discount is an imputed dividend to the preferred stockholders which reduces the amount of income available to common stockholders 
as a result of the staff s new accounting position  the issuance of the series a preferred stock resulted in a one time reduction in earnings attributable to common shareholders of  or per share in the first quarter of the staff s position is limited to the calculation of earnings per share and did not have any effect on the company s net income or cash flow 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the above factors contributed to a net loss of  however  due to the imputed dividend discussed above  the loss per common share based upon the net loss attributable to common stockholders of  amounted to per share for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  excluding the effect of unusual charges  adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance and charges for the acquisition of in process research and development from the psi acquisition  the company would have had net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
sales of ivd imaging systems increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of the powergene family of genetic analyzers to the company s product line in august as a result of the psi acquisition 
sales of ivd imaging system supplies and service increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  due to the larger installed base of ivd imaging systems and the conversion of the yellow iris installed base to the new chemstrip iristrip urine test strips marketed exclusively by the company 
sales of small instruments and supplies increased to million from million  an increase of million or  over the prior year 
the increase reflects generally higher sales levels of the statspin products  as well as the addition of the censlide product line in march cost of goods for ivd imaging systems increased as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due primarily to the addition of the model udx to the product line and amortization of increased fixed costs for ivd imaging systems 
these factors were partially offset by the addition of the higher margin powergene family of genetic analyzers to the company s product line in august cost of goods for ivd imaging system supplies and service increased as a percentage of sales of such products to for the year ended december  from for the prior year primarily due to relatively lower gross margins on sales of chemstrip iristrip urine test strips which accounted for a greater proportion of sales of system supplies  as well as a decline in gross margins on service of ivd imaging systems 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies decreased as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due to an overall change in product mix toward higher gross margin items 
the net result of these changes was a decrease in aggregate gross margin to for the year ended december  from for the prior year

amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  increased to  from  an increase of  or over the prior year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of intangible assets in the psi acquisition  as further described below 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include certain unusual charges to earnings of million primarily for the write off of deferred offering costs  litigation expenses  restructuring charges  and merger related expenses 
acquisition of in process research and development for the year ended december  reflects the psi acquisition which resulted in a non recurring charge of million 
acquisition of in process research and development for the year ended december  reflects the acquisition of lda systems  inc a company sponsored research and development company which resulted in a non recurring  non cash charge of million

at december   the company increased the valuation allowance by  based on an assessment of operating results and other factors 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period decrease 
the above factors contributed to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  excluding the charges for the acquisition of in process research and development from the psi acquisition  adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance and the million of unusual charges discussed above  the company would have had a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  excluding the charges for the acquisition of in process research and development from lda systems  inc and the recognition of the tax benefit due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the company would have had net income of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to principal payments on bank debt  an installment payment for the repurchase of common stock and pay down of accounts payable
