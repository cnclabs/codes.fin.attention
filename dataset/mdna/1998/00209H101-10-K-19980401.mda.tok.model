item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amtran is a leading provider of charter airline services and  on a targeted basis  scheduled airline services to leisure and other value oriented travelers 
amtran  through its principal subsidiary  american trans air  inc ata  has been operating for years and is the eleventh largest us airline in terms of revenue passenger miles 
ata provides charter service throughout the world to independent tour operators  specialty charter customers and the us military 
scheduled service is provided through nonstop and connecting flights from the gateway cities of chicago midway  indianapolis and milwaukee to popular vacation destinations such as hawaii  las vegas  florida  california  mexico and the caribbean 
an analysis by the company in of the profitability of its scheduled service and charter service business units disclosed that a significant number of scheduled service markets then being served by the company had become increasingly unprofitable at that point in time 
the company believes that several key factors had contributed to the deterioration of profitability of scheduled service operations in that time period  including i a significant increase in competition from larger carriers in the company s scheduled service markets  ii the negative impact on low fare carriers  such as the company  from unfavorable media coverage of the valujet accident in florida on may   and  to a lesser extent  the company s own decompression incident on the following day  iii a significant increase in jet fuel costs  and iv a federal excise tax on jet fuel beginning in the fourth quarter of in august  the company announced a significant restructuring of scheduled service operations 
more than one third of scheduled service capacity operated during the summer of was eliminated 
the company completely eliminated its boston and intra florida scheduled service operations and also exited completely  or reduced in frequency  certain markets served from chicago midway  indianapolis and milwaukee 
in conjunction with this restructuring  the company completed a reduction in its employee and contract work forces by the end of in addition  the company re evaluated the relative economic performance of its three aircraft fleet types in the context of the restructured markets to be served by the company and optimized the type and number of aircraft through a fleet restructuring which was completed by the end of the company reduced the number of boeing aircraft from units at the end of to seven units at the end of the remaining seven boeing aircraft are all powered by rolls royce engines 
the company committed the seven boeing s to mission specific uses in the us military and scheduled service business units 
as a result of the restructuring  the company believes that it has established a better economic platform from which to pursue its long term strategies of i maintaining its low cost advantage versus competitors  ii strengthening its leading position in the charter business  iii maintaining its leading position as a provider to the us military  iv selectively participating in scheduled service  and v capitalizing on selected growth opportunities in areas of the company s core competency

services were expanded to include lansing  michigan and madison  wisconsin in october b a departure is a single takeoff and landing operated by a single aircraft between an origin city and a destination city 
c block hours for any aircraft represent the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the origin city boarding ramp to the moment it comes to rest at the destination city boarding ramp 
d revenue passenger miles rpms represent the number of seats occupied by revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
rpms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity actually sold by the company 
e available seat miles asms represent the number of seats available for sale to revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
asms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity offered for sale by the company  whether sold or not 
f passenger load factor is the percentage derived by dividing rpms by asms 
passenger load factor is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because incremental passengers normally provide incremental revenue and profitability when seats are sold individually 
in the case of tour operator and us military business units  load factor is less relevant because an entire aircraft is sold by the company instead of individual seats 
since both costs and revenues are largely fixed for these types of flights  changes in load factor have less impact on business unit profitability 
consolidated load factors and scheduled service load factors for the company are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but load factors for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
g passengers enplaned are the number of revenue passengers who occupied seats on the company s flights 
this measure is also referred to as passengers boarded 
h revenue per asm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as rasm 
rasm measures the company s ability to maximize revenues from the sale of total available seat capacity 
in the case of scheduled service  rasm is a measure of the combined impact of load factor and yield see j below for the definition of yield 
in the case of tour operator and us military businesses  rasm is a measure of the company s ability to maximize revenues from the sale of an entire aircraft at one time 
in all cases  rasm adjusts for the differing seat capacities on the company s various fleet types 
i cost per asm expressed in cents is total operating expense divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as casm 
casm measures the company s effectiveness in minimizing the operating cost of producing total seat capacity 
j revenue per rpm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total rpms 
this measure is also referred to as yield 
yield is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because yield is a measure of the company s ability to optimize the price paid by customers purchasing individual seats 
yield is less relevant to the tour operator and us military business units because the entire aircraft is sold at one time for one price 
consolidated yields and scheduled service yields are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but yields for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
operating revenues total operating revenues for increased to million from million in this increase was due to a million increase in charter revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in scheduled service revenues and a million decrease in other revenues 
scheduled service revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the scheduled service operations of the company 
data shown for jet operations includes the combined operations of lockheed l  boeing and boeing aircraft in scheduled service

revenue per segment is a broad measure of the average price obtained for all flight segments flown by passengers in the company s scheduled service route network 
scheduled service revenues in decreased to million from million in scheduled service revenues comprised of consolidated revenues in  as compared to of consolidated revenues in scheduled service rpms decreased to billion from billion  while asms decreased to billion from billion  resulting in an increase of points in passenger load factor to in  from in scheduled service yield in increased to cents from cents in  while rasm increased to cents from cents between the same periods 
scheduled service departures in increased to  from  in  block hours decreased to  in  from  in  and passengers boarded decreased between periods to  as compared to  the company added scheduled service capacity during the second and third quarters of which primarily included expanded direct and connecting frequencies through the company s four major gateway cities of chicago midway  indianapolis  milwaukee and boston to west coast and florida markets already being served 
new seasonal scheduled service was also introduced in the second and third quarters of from new york to shannon and dublin  ireland  and belfast  northern ireland  and from the midwest to seattle 
new year round service also commenced to san diego  california  in the second quarter of the introduction of this new capacity coincided closely  however  with the may  valujet accident in florida and the resulting persistent negative media attention directed toward airline safety  and especially toward low fare airlines 
on may  the company experienced a cabin decompression incident on one of its own flights which  although it resulted in no serious injury to crew or passengers  nevertheless attracted additional negative media attention  occurring as it did one day after the valujet tragedy 
as a consequence  during the second and third quarters of  the company estimates that it lost significant scheduled service revenues from both canceled reservations and reservations which were never received 
in association with the restructuring of the company s scheduled service operations  a significant reduction in scheduled service was announced on august  between september and december   more than one third of the scheduled service capacity operating during the summer months was eliminated 
all scheduled service flights to and from boston were eliminated by december   including service to west palm beach  san juan  montego bay  st 
petersburg  las vegas  orlando and ft 
lauderdale 
intra florida services connecting the cities of ft 
lauderdale  orlando  miami  sarasota  st 
petersburg and ft 
myers were eliminated as of october  other selected services from indianapolis  chicago midway and milwaukee to florida and to west coast destinations were also reduced or eliminated by october  the company s scheduled service between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis and milwaukee was replaced with a code share agreement with chicago express on october  as discussed further below 
in association with this service reduction  all scheduled service ceased at seattle  grand cayman  west palm beach  montego bay  miami and san diego 
on october  the company also implemented a commuter code share partnership with chicago express to provide incremental connecting traffic between indianapolis  milwaukee and other smaller midwestern cities into the company s chicago midway connections with certain florida and west coast destinations 
this partnership was replaced with a contractual agreement with chicago express effective april   under which chicago express now operates seat jetstream propeller aircraft between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis  milwaukee  des moines  dayton and grand rapids  on behalf of ata 
service between chicago midway and lansing  michigan and madison  wisconsin was added under this agreement effective in the fourth quarter of after the restructuring  the company s core jet scheduled service included flights between chicago midway and five florida cities  las vegas  phoenix  los angeles and san francisco  indianapolis to four florida cities  las vegas and cancun  milwaukee to three florida cities  hawaii service from san francisco  los angeles and phoenix  and service between orlando and san juan and nassau 
as a result of the restructuring of scheduled service operations in the manner described above  scheduled service profitability was substantially improved in as compared to profitability was enhanced through a combination of significantly higher load factors and yields between periods  even though total revenues in scheduled service declined between years 
the company believes that profitability was enhanced in this business unit through the selective elimination of flights which had previously produced below average load factors and yield  and that the elimination of intra florida flying in particular was a prominent factor in this improvement 
profitability was further enhanced in certain scheduled service markets through the reassignment of aircraft fleet types to provide better balance within markets between revenues  costs  and aircraft operational capabilities 
scheduled service profitability improvement in was accomplished in spite of what would normally have been a demand dampening effect from the re introduction of the us departure and federal excise taxes on tickets on march   which had expired on january  in august  federal legislation was enacted which extends these taxes until the us departure tax for international destinations was increased from to per passenger  and a new us arrivals tax of per passenger was added for passengers arriving into the united states from international cities 
effective october   the new tax law also changed the method of computation of the federal excise tax from a standard of ticket sale value  to a declining percentage of ticket sale value ranging from to  plus an increasing inflation indexed charge per passenger segment flown ranging from to 
the company does not currently believe that the change in federal excise tax computation has placed it at either a significant pricing advantage or disadvantage as compared to the previous computation method 
the company does believe that certain of its low fare competitors may be disadvantaged by the new computation method due to their lower average segment fares and higher average intermediate stops as compared to the company in similar markets 
the company continues to evaluate the profit and loss performance of its scheduled service business  and the company may change the level of scheduled service operations from time to time 
the company began new service in june  between new york s john f 
kennedy international airport and chicago midway  indianapolis and st 
petersburg  and also added several frequencies between the midwest and the west coast for the summer season 
new york service to chicago midway and st 
petersburg was retained for the winter season 
new nonstop service between chicago midway and dallas ft 
worth  san juan and denver have been announced beginning in may in addition  the company s application for slots at new york s laguardia airport are currently pending with the dot which  if approved  the company intends to use for daily frequencies from chicago midway 
charter revenues 
the company s charter revenues are derived principally from independent tour operators  specialty charter customers and from the united states military 
the company s charter product provides full service air transportation to hundreds of customer designated destinations throughout the world 
total charter revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in charter revenue growth  prior to scheduled service restructuring in late  had been constrained by the dedication of a significant portion of the company s fleet to scheduled service expansion  including the utilization of two lockheed l aircraft for scheduled service to ireland and northern ireland between may and september the company s restructuring strategy  as reflected in the company s results of operations for  included a renewed emphasis on charter revenue sources 
the company believes that tour operator  specialty charter and military operations are businesses where the company s experience and size provide meaningful competitive advantage 
charter revenues produced of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in tour operator programs 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the tour operator flying operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages charter revenues derived from independent tour operators increased to million in  as compared to million in tour operator rpms decreased to billion in from billion in  while asms decreased to billion from billion 
tour operator rasm increased to cents from cents between the same periods 
tour operator passengers boarded decreased to  in  as compared to  in  tour operator departures decreased to  in  as compared to  in  and tour operator block hours decreased to  in  as compared to  in the company operates in two principal components of the tour operator business  known as track charter and specialty charter 
the larger track charter business component is generally comprised of low frequency but repetitive domestic and international flights between city pairs  which support high passenger load factors and are marketed through tour operators  providing value priced and convenient nonstop service to vacation destinations for the leisure traveler 
since track charter resembles scheduled service in terms of its repetitive flying patterns between fixed city pairs  it allows the company to achieve reasonable levels of crew and aircraft utilization although less than for scheduled service  and provides the company with meaningful protection from some fuel price increases through the use of fuel escalation reimbursement clauses in tour operator contracts 
the company believes that although price is the principal competitive criterion for its tour operator programs  product quality  reputation for reliability and delivery of services which are customized to specific needs have become increasingly important to the buyer of this product 
accordingly  as the company continues to emphasize the growth and profitability of this business unit  it will seek to maintain its low cost pricing advantage  while differentiating itself from competitors through the delivery of customized services and the maintenance of consistent and dependable operations 
in this manner  the company believes that it will produce significant value for its tour operator partners by delivering an attractively priced product which exceeds the leisure traveler s expectations 
specialty charter is a product which is designed to meet the unique requirements of the customer and is a business characterized by lower frequency of operation and by greater variation in city pairs served than the track charter business 
specialty charter includes such diverse contracts as flying university alumni to football games  transporting political candidates on campaign trips and moving nasa space shuttle ground crews to alternate landing sites 
the company also operates an increasing number of trips in all first class configuration for certain corporate and high end leisure clients 
although lower utilization of crews and aircraft and infrequent service to specialty destinations often result in higher average operating costs  the company has determined that the revenue premium earned by meeting special customer requirements usually more than compensates for these increased costs 
in addition  specialty charter programs sometimes permit the company to increase overall aircraft utilization by providing filler traffic during periods of low demand from other programs such as track charter 
the company believes that it is competitively advantaged to attract this type of business due to the size and geographic dispersion of its fleet  which reduces costly ferry time for aircraft and crews and thus permits more competitive pricing 
the diversity of the company s three fleet types also permits the company to meet a customer s particular needs by choosing the aircraft type which provides the most economical solution for those requirements 
military programs 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the military flight operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b    block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages charter revenues derived from the us military increased to million in  as compared to million in us military rpms increased to billion in  from million in  while asms increased to billion from billion 
military rasm increased to cents from cents between the same time periods 
us military passengers boarded increased to  in  as compared to  in  us military departures increased to  in  as compared to  in  and us military block hours increased to  in as compared to  in the company participates in two related military programs known as fixed award and short term expansion 
pursuant to the us military s fixed award system  each participating airline is awarded certain mobilization value points based upon the number and type of aircraft made available by that airline for military flying 
in order to increase the number of points awarded  in the company entered into a contractor teaming arrangement with four other cargo airlines serving the us military 
under this arrangement  the team has a greater likelihood of receiving fixed award business and  to the extent that the award includes passenger transport  the opportunity for the company to operate this flying is enhanced since the company represents all of the passenger transport capacity of the team 
as part of its participation in this teaming arrangement  the company pays a commission to the team  which passes that revenue on to all team members based upon their mobilization points 
all airlines participating in the fixed award business contract annually with the us military from october to the following september for each contract year  reimbursement rates are determined for aircraft types and mission categories based upon operating cost data submitted by the participating airlines 
these contracts generally are not subject to renegotiation once they become effective 
short term expansion business is awarded by the us military first on a pro rata basis to those carriers who have been awarded fixed contract business and then to any other carrier with aircraft availability 
expansion flying is generally offered to airlines on very short notice 
the us military business grew at a faster year over year rate than any other business unit of the company during in  the company s us military revenues represented of consolidated revenues  as compared to in as a result of the restructuring of scheduled service and the reconfiguration of the company s fleet in  the company committed four of its seven remaining boeing aircraft to the us military for the contract year ending september  as a result of an analysis undertaken during  the company was also successful in more accurately documenting the actual costs associated with military flying and was therefore able to obtain rate increases for the contract year ending september  the company has obtained additional rate increases for the contract year ending september  because military flying is generally less seasonal than leisure travel programs  the company believes that a larger us military business operation will tend to have a stabilizing impact on seasonal earnings fluctuations 
the company is also contractually protected from changes in fuel prices 
the company further believes that its fleet of aircraft is competitively advantaged to serving the transportation needs of the us military 
although foreign bases have been reduced in troop size  the us military still desires to maintain its service frequency to those bases and therefore often has a preference for smaller capacity  long range aircraft such as the company s boeing furthermore  in  the company became the first north american carrier to receive faa certification to operate boeing aircraft with minute etops  which permits these aircraft to operate missions over water which can be up to three hours from the nearest alternate airport 
the company believes that this certification  which applies to all of the company s boeing fleet  provides a competitive advantage in receiving awards of certain military flying 
the overall amount of military business that the company receives in any one year is dependent upon the percentage its team is of the total  the percentage it is of the passengers business of the team  and the amount of expansion business available and which the company is able to fly 
in  there was an unusual amount of both contract and expansion business that was available for the company 
in  the company expects that there will be somewhat less flying available for it to do 
ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental and cruise accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company markets these ground packages through its ambassadair travel club subsidiary exclusively to club members and through its ata vacations subsidiary to the general public 
in and  ground package revenues were unchanged at million 
the company s ambassadair travel club offers hundreds of tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members annually 
in  total packages sold increased over  and the average revenue earned for each ground package sold increased between periods 
ata vacations offers numerous ground package combinations to the general public for use on the company s scheduled service flights throughout the united states 
these packages are marketed through travel agents as well as directly by the company 
during  the number of ground packages sold increased as compared to lack of growth in the number of ground packages sold between periods was mainly due to the reduction of the company s scheduled service operations between years 
during  the average revenue earned for each ground package sold decreased as compared to the average revenue earned by the company for a ground package sale is a function of the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered and general competitive conditions with other air carriers offering similar products in the company s markets  all of which factors can change from period to period 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled and charter operations of ata 
other revenues decreased to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to a reduction in revenues earned between periods by providing substitute service to other airlines  partially offset by increases in other miscellaneous revenue categories 
a substitute service agreement typically provides for the company to operate aircraft with its crews on routes designated by the customer airline to carry the passengers of that airline for a limited period of time 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million from million in approximately million of the increase between periods was attributable to changes made in the third quarter of in senior executive positions and associated senior executive compensation plans 
special compensation totaling million was prepaid to the company s former president and chief executive officer during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  which was being amortized to expense over the anticipated two year term of his employment ending august due to his resignation in late may  a one time charge to expense for the unamortized million prepaid balance was made in the second quarter of to salaries  wages and benefits  whereas no such charge to expense was incurred in the prior year 
the cost of salaries and wages earned by cockpit crew members and related flight operations support staff in was approximately million higher than in these cost increases were incurred even though jet block hours flown by cockpit crew members declined by between periods 
this increase in the unit cost of cockpit crews was attributable to the following significant factors i the implementation of the cockpit crew collective bargaining agreement in august  under which a rate increase became effective  ii crew utilization for us military flying is significantly lower than for scheduled service and tour operator flying  and us military block hours increased as a percentage of total block hours to in  as compared to in  iii cockpit crew shortages during the first three quarters of resulted in the need to increase premium pay to cockpit crew members in order to adequately staff the spring and summer flying schedule  and iv cockpit crew productivity was reduced by the fleet restructuring completed during  which increased the percentage of jet block hours flown by three crew member aircraft lockheed l and boeing to in  as compared to in the salaries  wages and benefits cost for other employee groups declined by million in as compared to these costs declined partially as a result of the decline in equivalent full time employment between periods 
total equivalent full time employment declined by between years  although equivalent full time employment in the fourth quarter of was higher that in the fourth quarter of the increase in employment in late was primarily due to the addition of cockpit and cabin crews and reservations agents to adequately staff expected growth in flying capacity in compared to the fourth quarter of when the company had just completed significant staff reductions 
in addition to those planned staff reductions completed during the fourth quarter of  the change in salaries  wages and benefits expense for other employee groups was significantly affected by reduced employment in maintenance and engineering  which accounted for a million reduction in expense between and employment of maintenance and engineering staff  such as airframe and powerplant mechanics and engineers  was constrained in by broad shortages in related labor markets attributable to very strong current demand for these skills within the airline industry 
the company compensated for some of these shortages in by acquiring these skills through third party contract labor vendors 
the cost of maintenance contract labor which is a component of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs increased by million in as compared to salaries  wages and benefits cost per asm increased in to cents  as compared to cents in fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense for decreased to million from million in during  as compared to  the company consumed fewer gallons of jet fuel for flying operations  which resulted in a reduction in fuel expense of approximately million between periods 
the reduction in jet fuel consumed was due to the reduced number of block hours of jet flying operations between years 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  a decrease of between periods 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of fuel consumed decreased by as compared to  which resulted in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years 
also during the last three quarters of  the company incurred approximately million in fuel and oil expense to operate the jetstream aircraft under its agreement with chicago express  which was not in effect in the last three quarters of fuel and oil expense increased to cents per asm in  as compared to cents per asm in the increase in the cost per asm of fuel and oil expense between periods was partly due to the change in mix of jet block hours flown from the more fuel efficient twin engine boeing aircraft to the less fuel efficient three engine boeing and lockheed l aircraft 
in  of total jet block hours were flown by the boeing fleet  as compared to in the increase in cost per asm caused by the shift in fleet mix of jet block hours flown was substantially offset by the reduction in the average cost of jet fuel between periods 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
where the company uses its own employees to perform ground handling functions  the resulting cost appears within salaries  wages and benefits 
air navigation fees are assessed when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees decreased by to million in  as compared to million in during  the average cost per system jet departure for third party aircraft handling increased as compared to  and the average cost of landing fees per system jet departure increased between the same periods 
due to the restructuring of scheduled service in the fourth quarter of  the absolute number of system wide jet departures between and declined by to  from  which resulted in approximately million in volume related handling and landing expense reductions between periods 
this volume related decline was partially offset  however  by an approximately million price related handling and landing expense increase between periods attributable primarily to a change in jet departure mix 
because each airport served by the company has a different schedule of fees  including variable prices for different aircraft types  average handling and landing fee costs are a function of the mix of airports served and the fleet composition of departing aircraft 
on average  handling and landing fee costs for lockheed l wide body aircraft are higher than for narrow body aircraft  and average costs at foreign airports are higher than at many us domestic airports 
as a result of the reduction in the company s narrow body boeing fleet and the shift of revenue production towards charter operations  the company s jet departures in included proportionately more international and wide body operations than in in  of the company s jet departures were operated with wide body aircraft  as compared to in  and of the company s jet departures were from international locations  as compared to in the prior year 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees increased to cents in  from cents in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation reflects the periodic expensing of the recorded cost of owned airframes and engines  and rotable parts for all fleet types  together with other property and equipment owned by the company 
amortization is primarily the periodic expensing of capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all fleet types on a units of production basis using aircraft flight hours and cycles landings as the units of measure 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in  as compared to million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and engines decreased million in as compared to the company reduced its year over year investment in engines and airframe improvements due to the reconfiguration of the boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of as a result of the net reduction of four boeing aircraft at the end of as compared to the end of  and the complete elimination of pratt whitney powered boeing s from the fleet  some airframe and leasehold improvements were disposed of  and all spare pratt whitney engines and rotable parts were reclassified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
none of these assets therefore gave rise to depreciation expense in the company did increase its investment in computer equipment and furniture and fixtures between years  placed the west bay of the renovated midway hangar no 
into service in mid  and incurred increased debt issue costs between years relating to debt facility and senior unsecured notes issued  as well as aircraft lease negotiations completed primarily in the fourth quarter of these changes  together with increased costs pertaining to remaining rotable components and the provision for obsolescence of aircraft parts inventories  resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of million in as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in as compared to after including the offsetting amortization associated with manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the reduction of total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods 
this expense was also favorably impacted by the late reconfiguration of the boeing fleet and  in particular  the disposal of all pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft 
all unamortized net book values of engine and airframe overhauls pertaining to the pratt whitney powered aircraft were charged to the cost of the disposal of these assets in the third quarter of the company s seven remaining rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  four of which were delivered new from the manufacturer in late and late  are not presently generating any engine and airframe overhaul expense since the initial post delivery overhauls for the rolls royce powered boeing s are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the net reduction in engine and airframe amortization expense in pertaining to changes in the company s boeing fleet was approximately million as compared to engine and airframe amortization for the company s fleet of boeing aircraft increased by approximately million in as compared to due to the on going expansion of this fleet type and due to the completion of new overhauls for pratt whitney jtd engines that power the boeing fleet 
the increase between years in engine and airframe amortization expense for the company s lockheed l fleet was approximately million  which was primarily due to the addition of airframe overhauls to the fleet 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs was unchanged between and when these engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
depreciation and amortization expense per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the reconfiguration of the company s boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of  as a result of which the number of boeing aircraft operated by the company was reduced by four units 
the reduction in the size of the boeing fleet was an integral component of the company s restructuring of scheduled service  based upon profitability analysis which disclosed that  for some uses of the boeing in the company s markets  it was more profitable to substitute other aircraft with lower ownership costs 
aircraft rentals expense declined by million between and as a result of the boeing fleet restructuring 
four additional boeing aircraft were acquired and financed by sale leasebacks at various times during the first three quarters of  while one boeing aircraft previously on an operating lease was purchased during the second quarter of  and was subsequently sold and leased back in september the net increase in leased boeing aircraft between years  together with the incorporation of hushkits into new sale leasebacks of several boeing aircraft between periods  added approximately million in aircraft rentals expense between and aircraft rentals expense for was cents per asm  a decrease of from cents per asm in the period to period decrease in the size of the boeing fleet was a significant factor in this change since the rental cost of asms produced by this fleet type is significantly higher than for the company s other aircraft 
with the reduction in the higher ownership cost boeing aircraft in late  the company anticipates that the cost per asm produced by its leased aircraft fleet will continue at lower levels in future quarters 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for base and line maintenance activities  and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the cost per asm decreased by to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
repair costs were million lower in as compared to the prior year 
this was due to a reduction in both the total number of repairs performed and the average unit cost of repairs between periods 
negotiations were completed in early with several repair vendors which resulted in reduced unit charges for some repair activity 
additionally  the company established a maintenance disposition board in late which carefully reviews significant repair decisions in light of anticipated fleet requirements and the available quantity of serviceable components in stock 
the cost of expendable parts consumed increased million in as compared to the increase in the cost of expendable parts consumed was closely related to the company s heavy maintenance check programs for its fleet  which resulted in several more heavy airframe checks being completed in than in the previous year 
the cost of maintenance contract labor increased by million in as compared to as explained above under salaries  wages and benefits  the company increased its utilization of maintenance contract labor in to compensate for some shortages of airframe and powerplant mechanics and engineers 
the cost of parts loans and exchanges was million lower in as compared to due to improved internal procedures to limit the need for such loans and exchanges 
many of the company s aircraft under operating leases have certain return conditions applicable to the maintenance status of airframes and engines as of the termination of the lease 
the company accrues estimated return condition costs as a component of maintenance  materials and repairs expense based upon the actual condition of the aircraft as each lease termination date approaches  and based upon the company s ability to estimate the expected cost of conforming to these conditions 
return condition expenses accrued in were million lower than in  primarily due to the negotiation of new terms and conditions for several aircraft leases during  which eliminated return condition obligations which had existed prior to those negotiations 
crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel is primarily the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crew members that is incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate all company flights throughout the world 
the cost of air transportation is generally more significant for the charter business unit since these flights often operate between cities in which company crews are not normally based and may involve extensive international positioning of crews 
hotel and per diem expenses are incurred for both scheduled and charter services  although higher per diem and hotel rates generally apply to international assignments 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company s average full time equivalent cockpit and cabin crew employment was lower as compared to the prior year  even though jet block hours decreased by only between periods 
although the company did experience some crew shortages in the first quarter of associated with severe winter weather  shortages of both cockpit and cabin crews were more chronic in the first nine months of  and per crew member travel costs were consequently higher since crews spent greater amounts of time away from their bases to operate the company s schedule 
in addition  average crew travel costs for the us military and specialty charter businesses are much higher than for track charter and scheduled service since these flights more often operate away from crew bases 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the onboard costs of meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and in flight movie headsets sold  and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the cost of passenger service increased in to million  as compared to million in this change between periods was primarily due to an increase of approximately in the average cost to cater each passenger  offset by a decrease of in jet passengers boarded to  in  as compared to  in catering unit cost increased due to a change in the mix of passengers boarded from fewer scheduled service toward more charter and military passengers  the latter passengers  particularly military  are the most expensive passengers to cater in the company s business mix 
military and charter passengers accounted for of passengers boarded in  as compared to of passengers boarded in the cost per asm of passenger service increased to cents in  as compared to cents in commissions 
the company incurs commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of single seats on scheduled service 
in addition  the company pays commissions to secure some tour operator and military business 
commissions expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service commissions expense declined by million between periods  primarily as a result of the decline in total scheduled service revenues earned  and also as a result of an industry wide reduction in the standard travel agency commission rate from to during october military and tour operator commissions expense increased by million and million  respectively  due to the increased level of commissionable revenues earned in those business units in as compared to the cost per asm of commissions expense increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in ground package cost 
ground package cost includes the expenses incurred by the company for hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors to provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and ata vacations customers 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase in cost between periods was primarily due to a increase in the number of ambassadair ground packages sold 
there was no material change in the average cost of ground packages sold between years 
ground package cost per asm increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised of i booking fees paid to computer reservation systems crss to reserve single seat sales for scheduled service  ii credit card discount expenses incurred when selling single seats and ground packages to customers using credit cards for payment  iii costs of providing toll free telephone services  primarily to single seat and vacation package customers who contact the company directly to book reservations  and iv miscellaneous other selling expenses that are primarily associated with single seat sales 
other selling expenses decreased to million in  as compared to million in crs fees decreased million in as compared to due to both a decrease in total crs bookings made for the smaller scheduled service business unit between periods  and due to a reduction in the average cost of each crs booking made between years 
toll free telephone costs decreased million between periods due to less usage and lower rates 
other selling cost per asm decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in the previous year 
advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of air and ground packages 
advertising support for these lines of business was increased in consistent with the company s overall strategy to enhance rasm in these businesses through increases in load factor and yield 
additionally  advertising was comparatively low in the third quarter of due to the restructuring of numerous scheduled service markets which was initiated in the latter part of that quarter 
the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in this increase in cost per asm resulted from higher absolute advertising dollars being spent in a period of declining asms  but was nevertheless an integral part of the company s strategy in to enhance profitability in the scheduled service business 
facility and other rentals 
facility and other rentals includes the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facility and other rentals decreased to million in  as compared to million in there were some changes in specific facilities utilized by the company between periods  such as the addition of hangar space at chicago midway and the elimination of airport facilities at boston 
the company also reduced total facility expense between years through the sublease of excess facilities to third parties 
the cost per asm for facility and other rentals was unchanged between periods at cents 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in other operating expenses which experienced significant increases between years included i the cost of the chicago express commuter agreement  which became effective april   and ii the cost of property and sales taxes 
other operating expenses which experienced significant decreases between periods included i the cost of insurance  ii the cost of data and voice communications  and iii the cost of professional consulting fees 
several other categories of other operating expenses were lower in than in primarily due to the smaller size of the airline between periods 
other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to the change in the company s capital structure which resulted from the two financings completed on july   at which time the company i sold million principal amount of unsecured seven year notes  and ii entered into a new million secured revolving credit facility  thereby replacing the former secured revolving credit facility of million 
the capital structure of the company  prior to completing these new financings  provided for borrowings under the former credit facility to be constantly adjusted to meet the expected cash flow requirements of the company  thereby minimizing the level of borrowings on which interest would be paid 
under the new capital structure of the company  the borrowings under the notes remain fixed at million without regard to actual cash requirements at any point in time 
during  the weighted average borrowings were approximately million  as compared to million in the weighted average effective interest rate applicable to the company s borrowings in was  as compared to in the increase in the weighted average effective interest rates between years was primarily due to the interest rate applicable to the million in unsecured notes issued on july   which was higher than the average interest rates which were applicable to borrowings under the former credit facility 
in order to minimize the interest expense impact of the million of unsecured notes  the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  an increase of over interest income of million earned in income tax expense in  the company recorded million in income tax expense applicable to the income before income taxes for that year  while in income tax credits of million were recognized pertaining to the loss before income taxes for that year of million 
the effective tax rate applicable to was  while the effective tax rate applicable to was 
income tax expense and credits in both periods were significantly affected by the non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of of amounts paid for crew per diem 
the effect of this permanent difference on the effective income tax rate for financial accounting purposes becomes more pronounced in cases where before tax income or loss approaches zero  which was a significant cause for the unusually high effective tax rate in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for were also significantly affected by the one time million charge to salaries  wages and benefits in the second quarter of for the prepaid executive compensation package provided to the company s former president and chief executive officer 
of the total compensation paid to this former executive of the company in  approximately million is permanently non deductible against the company s federal income taxes  and thus constitutes an additional significant permanent difference between income for federal income tax purposes and financial accounting income in which did not exist in year ended december   versus year ended december  consolidated flight operations and financial data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the consolidated flight operations of the company  which includes the consolidated operations of lockheed l  boeing and boeing aircraft in all of the company s business units

scheduled service revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the scheduled service flight operations of the company  which includes the consolidated operations of lockheed l  boeing and boeing aircraft in scheduled service 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b    block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    load factor f passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h yield in cents j revenue per segment k see footnotes b through j on pages k revenue per segment flown is determined by dividing total scheduled service revenues by the number of passengers boarded 
revenue per segment is a broad measure of the average price obtained for all flight segments flown by passengers in the company s scheduled service route network 
scheduled service revenues in increased to million from million in scheduled service revenues comprised of total operating revenues in  as compared to of operating revenues in scheduled service rpms increased to billion from billion  while asms increased to billion from billion  resulting in a reduction in passenger load factor to in from in yield on scheduled service in increased to cents per rpm from cents per rpm in scheduled service departures in increased to  from  in  while passengers boarded increased over such period to  as compared to  charter revenues 
total charter revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in charter revenue growth  prior to scheduled service restructuring in late  was constrained by the dedication of a significant portion of the company s fleet to scheduled service expansion  including the utilization of two lockheed l aircraft for scheduled services to ireland and northern ireland between may and september the analysis of profitability by business unit which was performed by the company for the six quarters ended june   disclosed that both military and tour operator components had produced consistent profits over the period studied 
the company s lockheed l fleet performed well in a charter environment based upon relatively low frequency of operation and high passenger load factors  and the boeing performed well in the military business unit while the boeing worked well with certain tour operators 
the company began to implement strategies to improve the financial performance of charter operations in the third and fourth quarters of  and both tour operator and military flying are expected to play a role of growing significance in the company s future business operations

the rasm on us military revenues in increased to cents as compared to cents in us military passengers boarded decreased to  in  as compared to  in  and us military departures decreased to  in  as compared to  in ground package revenues 
ground package revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in in  total packages sold increased as compared to  and the average price of each ground package sold by the company s ambassadair travel club increased as compared to the prior year 
during  the number of ata vacations ground packages sold increased as compared to  but the average price of each ground package sold decreased as compared to the prior year 
the average price paid to the company for a ground package sale is a function of the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered  and general competitive conditions with other air carriers offering similar products in the company s markets 
some ata vacations markets experienced price reductions in due to intense price competition 
other revenues 
other revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the revenue increase between years was attributable to an increase in the number of block hours of substitute service provided by the company to other airlines 
the remaining increase in other revenues between periods was primarily due to revenue growth in several of the company s affiliated businesses 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense for increased to million from million in approximately million of the increase in was attributable to the addition of cockpit and cabin crews  reservations agents  base station staff and maintenance staff to support the company s growth in capacity between periods  and approximately million of the increase was attributable to the related growth in employee benefits costs 
average company full time equivalent employees increased by in as compared to the prior year  although the reduction in force implemented in late resulted in approximately fewer full time equivalent employees in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the company substantially completed this reduction in force in the fourth quarter of  and recorded  in related severance costs in salaries  wages and benefits expense in was cents per asm  an increase of from a cost of cents per asm in the cost per asm increased partially as a result of a increase in the average rate of pay for the company s employees as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company has increased employment in several maintenance and base station locations in lieu of continuing the use of third party contractors  as it believes it can provide more reliable operations and better customer service at a lower total cost by using its own employees in these selected locations 
the company has experienced related savings in the expense lines of handling  landing and navigation fees  and in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs  as further described in those following sections 
in december  the company implemented a four year collective bargaining agreement with its flight attendants  which was the first of the company s labor groups to elect union representation 
an additional four year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the company s cockpit crews on september  the pay related terms of the new cockpit crew agreement were implemented retroactively to august   including  among other things  a rate increase of approximately to cockpit crew pay scales for the first year of the new contract 
fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense for increased to million from million in  due to an increase in fuel consumed to operate the company s expanded block hours of flying  an increase in the average price paid per gallon of fuel consumed and the imposition of a cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel consumed for domestic use effective october  during  the company consumed more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations and flew more block hours than in  which accounted for approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense between years excluding price and tax changes 
the growth in gallons of fuel consumed was lower than the growth in block hours flown between years due to a change in the mix of block hours flown by fleet type 
of greatest significance was the reduction of total block hours flown by the lockheed l fleet between periods since the fuel burn per block hour for this wide body aircraft is approximately twice as high as the burn rates for the company s other fleet types 
during  the company s average price paid per gallon of fuel consumed excluding the excise tax described in the following paragraph increased by as compared to fuel price increases paid by the company reflected generally tighter supply conditions for aviation fuel  which persisted throughout most of as compared to the prior year 
the company estimates that the year over year increase in average price paid for jet fuel resulted in approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense between periods 
on october   the company became subject to a cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel consumed for domestic use by commercial air carriers 
the effect of this tax in the first three quarters of  as compared to the first three quarters of  was to increase the company s cost of jet fuel by approximately million 
fuel and oil expense for was cents per asm  an increase of as compared to cents per asm in the increase in the cost per asm of fuel and oil expense was primarily a result of higher prices and the new excise tax  partially offset by the expanded use of the more fuel efficient twin engine boeing aircraft in the company s fleet 
during  the company s boeing aircraft accounted for of total block hours flown  as compared to of total block hours flown in due to the reduction of the company s boeing fleet in late  the company s mix of block hours flown in future years is expected to reflect a lower proportion of fuel efficient boeing block hours  and a higher proportion of the less fuel efficient boeing and lockheed l fleet types 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling  landing and navigation fees decreased by to million in  as compared to million in during  the average cost per system departure for third party aircraft handling declined as compared to the prior year  and the average cost of landing fees per system departure decreased between the same periods 
because each airport served by the company has a different schedule of fees  including variable prices for different aircraft types  average handling and landing fee costs are a function of the mix of airports served as well as the fleet composition of departing aircraft 
on average  these costs for narrow body aircraft are less than for wide body aircraft  and the average costs at domestic us airports are less than the average costs at most foreign airports 
in  of the company s departures were operated with narrow body aircraft  as compared to in  and of the company s departures were from us domestic locations  as compared to in handling costs also vary from period to period according to decisions made by the company to use third party handling services at some airports in lieu of using the company s own employees 
during  the company implemented a policy of self handling at four domestic us airports with significant operations  which had been substantially handled using third party contractors in the prior year 
this change resulted in lower absolute third party handling costs for these locations and contributed to lower system average contract handling costs per departure for  as compared to the company incurred higher salaries  wages and benefits expense as a result of this policy change  as noted in salaries  wages and benefits 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees decreased to cents in from cents in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million from million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and engines  and other property and equipment owned by the company  increased million in as compared to the prior year 
the company increased its year over year ownership of engines and rotable aircraft components to support the expanding fleet  and increased its investment in computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the company also placed the west bay of the renovated midway hangar no 
into service in mid and incurred increased debt issue costs between years related to debt facility and aircraft lease negotiations completed in amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in as compared to the prior year  after including the offsetting amortization of approximately million in associated manufacturers credits 
the increasing cost of overhaul amortization reflects the increase in the number of aircraft added to the company s fleet and the increase in cycles and block hours flown between years 
new aircraft introduced into the company s fleet generally do not require airframe or engine overhauls until one or more years after first entering service 
therefore  the resulting amortization of these overhauls generally occurs on a delayed basis from the date the aircraft is placed into service 
accordingly  the company anticipates that the average cost of engine and airframe amortization per block hour and cycle will increase in future years for all fleet types  as all aircraft receive their initial engine and airframe overhauls after being placed into service 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures  and which cannot be economically repaired  is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs increased million between years 
depreciation and amortization cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to continued growth in the size of the company s leased aircraft fleet  although the company significantly reduced the size of its boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of  as is more fully described in disposal of assets 
the addition of three leased boeing aircraft in the first three quarters of resulted in approximately million of increased aircraft rentals for that time period  as compared to the prior year 
the subsequent reduction of this fleet type by a net four units after including two new deliveries from the manufacturer in december resulted in a year over year fourth quarter reduction of aircraft rent expense of approximately million 
the reduction in the size of the boeing fleet was an integral component of the company s restructuring of scheduled service  based upon profitability analysis which disclosed that for some uses of the boeing in the company s markets prior to restructuring  it was more profitable to substitute other aircraft with lower ownership costs 
several additional boeing and lockheed l aircraft leased in contributed million and million  respectively  in incremental aircraft rentals between years 
aircraft rentals expense was reduced by million for the first four months of  as compared to the prior year  due to the purchase of four pratt whitney spare engines in may  which had been previously leased 
due to the elimination of all pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft from the company s fleet  the company reclassified these owned spare engines as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
aircraft rentals expense for was cents per asm  an increase of from cents per asm in the period over period increase in the size of the boeing fleet was a significant factor in this change  since the rental cost of asms produced by this fleet type is significantly higher than for the company s other aircraft 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the cost per asm decreased by to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
although the cost of repairs for repairable and rotable components increased million between periods  the cost of expendable parts consumed decreased million  and the cost of parts loans and exchanges decreased million 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs cost was also reduced by million in  as compared to  due to a planned reduction in the use of third party maintenance staff in favor of using more company maintenance employees for both base and line maintenance activities 
the company incurred higher salaries  wages and benefits expense as a result of this policy change  as noted in a preceding section 
the cost of the company s maintenance  materials and repairs remained essentially unchanged in  as contrasted with the increase in asms between years  and the increase in block hours 
this favorable comparison is partly due to the significant expansion of the company s fleet during when used aircraft are initially brought into the company s fleet  the cost of maintenance  materials and repairs required to bridge that aircraft into the company s maintenance program are capitalized 
such expenditures normally extend the available flying hours for that aircraft before routine heavy maintenance  materials and repairs expenses begin to be incurred  although those aircraft begin producing both asms and block hours immediately upon acquisition 
the more favorable comparison to block hours between years is also indicative of the faster growth in the company s twin engine boeing fleet  which is composed of newer and more technologically advanced aircraft which require relatively less routine maintenance than the company s older three engine lockheed l and boeing fleets 
the boeing fleet accounted for of block hours in  as compared to in return condition expenses accrued in were million more than in this increase was primarily due to changes in the mix of aircraft leases and associated return conditions which became effective during  offset by both the extensive restructuring of the boeing fleet and the sale leaseback of six hushkitted boeing aircraft during under new lease terms and conditions 
crew and other employee travel 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company increased its average full time equivalent crew employment by as compared to the prior year  even though departures increased by and block hours increased by between periods 
in the first quarter of  the company experienced crew shortages  which were exacerbated by severe winter weather  causing significant flight delays  diversions and cancellations 
the company s crew complement in the third quarter of was again insufficient to effectively operate the flying schedule and resulted in more crew time being spent away from base during that quarter 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
this increase in unit cost was approximately equivalent to a average increase in the cost per crew member of hotel  positioning and per diem expenses between years 
passenger service 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the cost of passenger service decreased in to million  as compared to million in although total passengers boarded increased by to  in  as compared to  in  the average cost to cater each passenger declined between years due to a planned reduction in catering service levels in select charter and scheduled service markets beginning in the second quarter of this cost reduction was partially offset by a increase in military passengers boarded between years  which are the most expensive passengers to cater in the company s business mix 
the cost of servicing passengers who were inconvenienced by flight delays and cancellations increased by million between years 
approximately million of this increase was incurred in association with the severe winter weather and consequent flight schedule disruptions which occurred in the first quarter of the cost per asm of passenger service decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
the lower cost per asm was primarily due to the lower cost of catering per passenger boarded  partially offset by the higher cost per asm of servicing inconvenienced passengers 
commissions 
commissions expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase between years was the corresponding increase in scheduled service revenues earned  approximately two thirds of which was generated through travel agencies which received a commission on such sales 
the cost per asm of commissions expense was unchanged at cents for both and ground package cost 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase in cost is primarily due to the increase in the number of ground packages sold between periods 
in  ambassadair sold more ground packages  and ata vacations sold more ground packages  than in the average cost of each ground package sold by ambassadair increased between years  while the average cost of each ground package sold by ata vacations decreased by between periods 
ground package cost per asm increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in  which reflects the comparatively faster growth in ground package sales produced by ambassadair and ata vacations as compared to the overall asm growth of the company between years 
other selling expenses 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million and million  respectively  of this increase was attributable to more credit card discounts and crs fees incurred to support the growth in scheduled service between years 
another million of the increase was due to higher usage of toll free telephone service between periods  some of which was associated with the accommodation of passengers onto other carriers flights due to the company s reduction of scheduled service in the third and fourth quarters of other selling cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in advertising support for single seat scheduled service and ground package sales increased consistent with the growth in associated revenues and the need to meet competitive actions in the company s markets 
the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in facilities and other rentals 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase in expense noted for was partly attributable to higher facility costs resulting from the company becoming a signatory carrier at orlando international airport  together with a year over year increase in facility costs for boston operations prior to the elimination of scheduled service at boston in the fourth quarter of the increased facility costs at orlando international airport have associated savings in lower handling and landing fees for the company s flights at that airport 
also in  the company incurred higher facility rental expense in association with the late sale leaseback of the indianapolis hangar to the city of indianapolis  for the chicago midway hangar no 
and for the new chicago reservations facility  which was first occupied in september the cost per asm for facility and other rents increased to cents in  as compared to cents in disposal of assets 
during the third quarter of  the company committed to a plan to dispose of up to seven boeing aircraft 
a letter of intent was signed with a major lessor on july  which included the cancellation of operating leases on five aircraft and the return of those aircraft to the lessor before the end of negotiations also commenced with a major lessor during the third quarter for the cancellation of operating leases on two additional aircraft in during the third quarter  the company recorded a loss on disposal of the initial five aircraft according to the terms and conditions negotiated and agreed in the letter of intent 
an estimate of the expected loss on disposal of the additional two aircraft was also recorded in the third quarter  although a specific letter of intent had not yet been signed 
the total loss on disposal recorded in the third quarter was million for all aircraft 
these aircraft transactions were all completed during the fourth quarter of  at which time the estimated loss on disposal was reduced by million to an actual loss of million 
the source of the loss on the termination of these aircraft leases was primarily from the write off of the unused net book value of the associated airframe and engine overhauls 
for several aircraft  the company was required to meet additional maintenance return conditions associated with airframes and engines  the cost of which was charged to the loss on disposal 
these costs were partially offset by cash proceeds received from the lessor and by the application of associated deferred aircraft rent credits and manufacturers credits 
in addition to these costs  the company also owned four spare pratt whitney engines  together with consumable  repairable and rotable components specific to the pratt whitney powered boeing s 
the net book value of these engines and parts approximated million as of december   and were reclassified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
other expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in significant components of the year over year variance included increases in substitute service and passenger reprotection costs  professional fees  data communications costs  insurance costs and consulting fees in connection with the detailed route profitability study 
other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in income tax expense in  the company recorded million in tax credits applicable to the loss before income taxes for that year  while income tax expense of million was recognized pertaining to income before income taxes for the effective tax rate applicable to tax credits in was  and the effective tax rate for income earned in was 
the company s effective income tax rates are unfavorably influenced by the permanent non deductibility from taxable income of of crew per diem expenses incurred in both years 
the impact of this permanent difference on effective tax rates becomes more pronounced as taxable income or loss approach zero 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
the company has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements from cash flow from operations and long term borrowings from banks and other lenders 
as described further below  in the third quarter of the company completed two separate financings designed to lengthen the maturity of its long term debt and diversify its credit sources  including the issuance of unsecured notes and a revolving credit facility that had an extended maturity  lower interest rate and less restrictive covenants than the former credit facility 
for  and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities between and was attributable to such factors as increased earnings  growth in scheduled service air traffic liability associated with advanced ticket sales  the liquidation of certain assets held for sale  and other factors 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities between and was due primarily to the lower profitability between years  coupled with the reduction in air traffic liability associated with the restructuring of scheduled service 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for  and such amounts included cash capital expenditures totaling million in  million in  and million in for engine overhauls  airframe improvements and the purchase of rotable parts 
cash capital expenditures were supplemented with other capital expenditures  financed directly with debt  totaling million in  million in and million in the million in new debt issued in was to directly finance the purchase of one boeing aircraft and one boeing aircraft  both of which had previously been subject to leases accounted for as operating leases 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in  and debt proceeds in the period included million in proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes and million in proceeds from borrowing against the new credit facility 
debt proceeds in the period included primarily the addition of million in revolving credit facility availability for financing the installation of hushkits on boeing aircraft 
payments on long term debt in the period included primarily the full repayment of the former credit facility of million 
aircraft and fleet transactions 
in november  the company signed a purchase agreement for six new boeing s which  as subsequently amended  now provides for seven total aircraft to be delivered between late and late in conjunction with the boeing purchase agreement  the company entered into a separate agreement with rolls royce commercial aero engines limited for rb e engines to power the seven boeing aircraft and to provide one spare engine 
under the rolls royce agreement  which became effective january   rolls royce has provided the company various spare parts credits and engine overhaul cost guarantees 
if the company does not take delivery of the engines  a prorated amount of the credits that have been used are required to be refunded to rolls royce 
the aggregate purchase price under these two agreements is approximately million per aircraft  subject to escalation 
the company accepted delivery of the first five aircraft under these agreements in september and december  november and december  and november  all of which were financed under leases accounted for as operating leases 
the final two deliveries under this agreement are scheduled for july and december advanced payments totaling approximately million million per aircraft are required prior to delivery of the two remaining aircraft  with the remaining purchase price payable at delivery 
as of december   and  the company had recorded million  million and million  respectively  in advanced payments applicable to aircraft scheduled for future delivery 
the company intends to finance both future deliveries under this agreement through sale leaseback transactions accounted for as operating leases 
in the first quarter of  the company purchased four boeing aircraft  financing all of these through sale leasebacks accounted for as operating leases by the end of the third quarter of in the second quarter of  the company purchased a fifth boeing aircraft which had been previously financed by the company through a lease accounted for as an operating lease 
this aircraft was financed through a separate bridge debt facility until the completion of a sale leaseback transaction during the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company purchased an additional boeing aircraft which had been previously financed by the company through a lease accounted for as an operating lease  financing this purchase through the issuance of a short term note and a payment of cash 
the company currently expects to finance this aircraft through a sale leaseback transaction accounted for as an operating lease in on july   the company entered into a letter of intent with a major lessor to cancel several boeing and lockheed l operating aircraft leases then in effect 
under the terms of the letter of intent  the company canceled leases on five boeing aircraft powered by pratt whitney engines and returned these aircraft to the lessor by the end of the company was required to meet certain return conditions associated with several aircraft  such as providing maintenance checks to airframes 
the lessor reimbursed the company for certain leasehold improvements made to some aircraft and credited the company for certain prepayments made in earlier years to satisfy qualified maintenance expenditures for several aircraft over their original lease terms 
the cancellation of these leases reduced the company s fleet of pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft from seven to two units 
the company also agreed to terminate existing operating leases on three lockheed l aircraft and to purchase the airframes pertaining to these aircraft for million  while signing a new operating lease covering only the nine related engines 
the lockheed l airframe and engine portion of this transaction was not completed until the second quarter of the lessor also provided the company with approximately million in additional unsecured financing for a term of seven years 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of a million loss on disposal of assets in the third quarter of the company also agreed to purchase one rolls royce powered boeing aircraft from the same lessor in the fourth quarter of this purchase was not completed in  and the aircraft was acquired from the lessor on a short term rental agreement pending the completion of the purchase in september the company financed this purchase through a payment of cash and the issuance of a million note which  as amended  matures on january  the note requires monthly payments of  in principal and interest from october  through december   with the balance due at maturity 
the company currently intends to sell this aircraft and repay this note  subject to a short term rental agreement under which the aircraft would continue to be operated by the company 
the temporary acquisition of this aircraft in late  together with the delivery of two new rolls royce powered boeing aircraft from the manufacturer in the fourth quarter of  and the return of the last two pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft discussed in the next paragraph  resulted in an all rolls royce powered boeing fleet of seven units by the end of in september  the company began negotiations with a major lessor to cancel existing operating leases on the company s remaining two pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft 
these aircraft were returned to the lessor by the end of this transaction resulted in the recognition of a million loss on disposal of assets in the third quarter of issuance of unsecured notes 
on july   the company completed two separate financings designed to lengthen the maturity of the company s long term debt and diversify its credit sources 
on that date  the company i sold million principal amount of unsecured seven year notes in a private offering under rule a  and ii entered into a new secured revolving credit facility 
the company subsequently completed an exchange offer to holders of the unsecured seven year notes in january  under which offer those notes issued in the original private offering could be tendered in exchange for fully registered notes of equal value 
the unsecured senior notes mature on august  each note bears interest at the annual rate of  payable on february and august of each year beginning february  the notes rank pari passu with all unsecured  unsubordinated indebtedness of the company existing now or created in the future  are effectively subordinated to the company s obligations under secured indebtedness to the extent of such security  and will be senior to any subordinated indebtedness of the company created in the future 
all payments of interest and principal are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured  unsubordinated basis  jointly and severally  by each of the active subsidiaries of the company 
the company may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after august   initially at of their principal amount plus accrued interest  declining ratably to of their principal amount plus accrued interest at maturity 
at any time prior to august   the company may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of sales of common stock  at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest  provided that at least million in aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after such redemption 
the notes are subject to covenants for the benefit of the note holders  including  among other things  limitations on i the incurrence of additional indebtedness  ii the making of certain restricted payments  iii the creation of consensual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other payments by certain subsidiaries  iv the issuance and sale of capital stock by certain subsidiaries  v the issuance of guarantees by certain subsidiaries  vi certain transactions with shareholders and affiliates  vii the creation of liens on certain assets or properties  viii certain types of sale leaseback transactions  and ix certain sales  transfers or other dispositions of assets 
the net proceeds of the unsecured notes were approximately million  after application of costs and fees of issuance 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the company s prior bank facility and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include the purchase of additional aircraft and or the refinancing of existing leased aircraft 
credit facilities 
concurrently with the issuance of the unsecured notes  on july   the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility that includes up to million for stand by letters of credit 
ata is the borrower under the new credit facility  which is guaranteed by the company and each of the company s other active subsidiaries 
the principal amount of the new facility matures on april   and borrowings are secured by certain lockheed l aircraft and engines 
the loan to value ratio for collateral securing the new facility may not exceed at any time 
borrowings under the new facility bear interest  at the option of ata  at either i libor plus to depending upon certain financial ratios  or ii the agent bank s prime rate plus to depending upon certain financial ratios 
the facility contains various covenants including  among other things i limitations on incurrence of debt and liens on assets  ii limitations on capital expenditures  iii restrictions on payment of dividends and other distributions to stockholders  iv limitations on mergers and the sale of assets  v restrictions on the prepayment or redemption of certain indebtedness  including the notes  and vi maintenance of certain financial ratios such as minimum tangible net worth  cash flow to interest expense and aircraft rentals and total adjusted liabilities to tangible net worth 
the company s former credit facility had initially provided a maximum of million  including million for stand by letters of credit  subject to the maintenance of certain collateral value  including certain owned lockheed l aircraft  certain receivables  and certain rotables and spare parts 
as a result of the company s need to restructure its scheduled service business  the company renegotiated certain terms of the former credit facility effective september   including the modification of certain loan covenants to take into account the expected losses in the third and fourth quarters of in return for this covenant relief  the company agreed to implement changes to the underlying collateral for the former facility and to change the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the facility 
the company pledged additional owned engines and equipment as collateral for the facility as of the implementation date of the new agreement 
the company further agreed to reduce the million of borrowing availability secured by the owned lockheed l fleet by million per month from april through september  and by million per month from october through april loans under the renegotiated facility were subject to interest  at the company s option  at either i prime to prime plus  or ii the eurodollar rate plus to 
the former facility was scheduled to mature on april   and contained various covenants and events of default  including maintenance of a specified debt to equity ratio and a minimum level of net worth  achievement of a minimum level of cash flow  and restrictions on aircraft acquisitions  liens  loans to officers  change of control  indebtedness  lease commitments and payment of dividends 
at december   the company had classified million of former credit facility borrowings to current maturities of long term debt 
of this amount  million was attributable to the scheduled reduction of availability secured by the owned lockheed l fleet during the months ending december  the remaining million represented the amount of the spare pratt whitney engines which were pledged to the credit facility and which were to be repaid from the anticipated sale 
the net book value of these spare engines  which approximates estimated market value  is classified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
in july  the company sold two of the four spare pratt whitney engines  and the company continues to market the remaining two spare engines and parts to users of pratt whitney powerplants 
at december   the company reclassified the remaining million in net book value for spare engines and parts to long term assets held for sale 
as of december   and  the company had borrowed the maximum amounts then available against its credit facilities  of which million was repaid on january   million was repaid on january   and million was repaid on january  the company also maintains a million revolving credit facility available for its short term borrowing needs and for securing the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings against this credit facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings against this facility as of december  or  however  the company did have outstanding letters of credit secured by this facility aggregating million and million  respectively 
stock repurchase program 
in february  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
between and  the company repurchased  shares of common stock under this program 
no shares were repurchased during subsequent purchase commitments and options for boeing aircraft 
the company has signed purchase agreements to acquire boeing adv aircraft at agreed prices 
nine of these aircraft are currently leased by the company 
the other two aircraft  currently on lease to another airline  may be purchased in either february  august or october  depending upon the exercise of lease extension options available to the current lessee 
the company currently intends to install engine hushkits on these boeing aircraft in order to meet stage noise requirements for its fleet 
year until recently many computer programs were written to store only two digits of year related date information in order to make the storage and manipulation of such data more efficient 
programs which use two digit date fields  however  may not be able to distinguish between such years as and in some circumstances this date limitation could result in system failures or miscalculations  potentially causing disruptions of business processes or system operations 
the date field limitation is frequently referred to as the year problem 
the year project 
in the fourth quarter of the company initiated a year project to address this issue 
during the first quarter of the company inventoried its internal computer systems  facilities infrastructure  aircraft components and other hardware  and completed a year risk assessment for these items 
the company also began active participation on the year committee of the air transport association  an airline industry trade association 
this committee represents most major us airlines and is evaluating the year readiness of federal  state and local governments to provide reliable operations for airports and air traffic control systems beyond december renovation  testing and implementation of systems for year readiness is now in progress and will be ongoing through the end of renovation of systems will include several different strategies such as the conversion  replacement  upgrade or elimination of selected hardware platforms  applications  operating systems  databases  purchased packages  utilities and internal and external interfaces 
the company plans to use both internal and external consulting resources to complete these modifications 
computer infrastructure 
the company currently uses approximately separate computer infrastructure components to support various aspects of its world wide operations 
such components include major software packages both purchased and internally developed  operating systems for computers  computer hardware and peripheral devices  and local and wide area communications networks 
based upon the company s risk assessment completed in the first quarter of  it currently believes that over of its computer infrastructure components are fully compliant with year standards 
approximately projects have been identified to address components which are not believed to be year compliant and to test those components believed to be compliant 
although work on non critical components will continue throughout  the company plans to ensure compliance of all mission critical components by july  and all forward looking systems prior to the date when they might be impacted 
properties and facilities infrastructure 
the company currently uses approximately computer dependent systems in its properties and facilities for such purposes as providing heat and light  electrical power and security 
these systems were inventoried during the first quarter of  and all maintenance contracts were also evaluated 
the company presently believes that there are no significant issues for these systems which would prevent achieving year readiness by the end of a certification of compliance is being requested from each supplier associated with these systems  and the company has prepared approximately project plans to test the year readiness of these systems 
aircraft computer components 
the company is dependent upon a number of computer devices on board its aircraft which are used to support such activities as radio communications  air navigation  and certain flight instruments and controls  among other things 
these devices are supplied by large third party vendors such as aircraft manufacturers and avionics and aircraft parts suppliers 
the company has completed a year assessment of these devices in cooperation with the third party vendors  and currently believes that only a small number of aircraft computer components are not presently year compliant 
the company is in the process of obtaining year compliance certification from these vendors  as well as determining what corrective steps will be needed to bring all such components into compliance with year standards 
vendor and supplier readiness 
the company is dependent upon a number of vendors and suppliers to provide essential goods and services to operate the company s flight schedule throughout the world 
for example  the company consumed over million gallons of jet fuel in which was supplied by several dozen vendors at hundreds of delivery points throughout the world 
fuel vendors are dependent upon a large number of computer devices in providing these services to the company  and the failure of such devices to operate correctly during and after the year could result in the inability of such suppliers to meet their fuel delivery commitments to the company  in which case the company could suffer serious disruptions to its flight schedule due to lack of fuel 
the company is therefore communicating with all such major vendors and suppliers to ascertain what actions these vendors are taking to ensure their readiness to provide essential goods and services to the company after the company is requesting written certification of year readiness from all essential suppliers  and will further take such steps as it believes are necessary to validate such compliance 
domestic and international airports 
the company flies to over individual airports world wide each year 
the smooth operation of many airports used by the company is highly dependent upon computer systems and hardware devices 
such airports are typically operated by governmental or quasi governmental agencies  both foreign and domestic  who are primarily responsible for the installation and operation of all computer devices at those airports 
computers and software packages control such aspects of airport operations as radar tracking of aircraft  instrument landing systems  air and ground communications  runway lighting  baggage delivery  environmental controls such as heat and lighting  passenger security screening  and arrivals and departures data display 
other governmental agencies use computers to provide essential services at airports  such as customs and immigration screening and weather reporting 
the safe and efficient operation of the company s aircraft in airspace between airports is also highly dependent on computer systems and hardware which are operated and maintained primarily by domestic and foreign governmental agencies 
in the united states  the federal aviation administration has primary responsibility for the operation of the domestic air traffic control system  including regional air traffic control and radar systems 
as a member of the air transport association year committee  the company is participating with other airlines to test and validate the year readiness of the air transportation infrastructure such as airports and air traffic control systems 
at present  no comprehensive inventory and risk assessment of airport and air traffic control systems has been completed  and therefore the company cannot determine to what degree  if any  the air transportation infrastructure is at risk of failing to meet year readiness standards 
in addition  the company cannot presently estimate what cost  if any  will be incurred by the company to make modifications to its aircraft or other systems or hardware to comply with requirements which may be imposed before the year by governmental agencies as part of their efforts to prepare for operations in the year and beyond 
estimated costs of achieving year readiness 
based upon all data currently available to the company  it presently estimates that the total cost of meeting year standards  including computer and facilities infrastructure  aircraft and airports  will range between and million 
such estimated cost includes approximately million in capital expenditures to acquire new software and hardware to replace non compliant computer devices  as well as from to million in labor and related expenses to perform all year project work to insure the readiness of remaining computer devices for operation after the range of labor cost estimates between and million is due to the different costs of internal and external labor needed to perform this work  as well as the potential increase in all technology labor costs due to year related skills shortages which may occur before the end of approximately of the aforementioned capital and labor costs represents the cost of already budgeted systems upgrade or replacement projects which are being pursued for reasons other than year compliance  however  year compliance will be one of the by products 
it is possible that the company will determine that additional costs beyond those estimated above will be required to complete all year activities as testing and implementation proceeds through the end of the company expects to incur most of these costs during and  with no significant portion of these costs having been incurred in forward looking information information contained within business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking information which can be identified by forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  will  should  anticipates  or the negative thereof  or other variations in comparable terminology 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current knowledge of factors affecting the company s business 
the differences between expected outcomes and actual results can be material  depending upon the circumstances 
therefore  where the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results in any forward looking information  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis  but the company can provide no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished 
the company has identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company 
the company s capital structure is subject to significant financial leverage  which could impair the company s ability to obtain new or additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures  could increase the company s vulnerability to a sustained economic downturn and could restrict the company s ability to take advantage of new business opportunities or limit the company s flexibility to respond to changing business conditions 
under the terms of certain financing agreements  the company is required to maintain compliance with certain specified covenants  restrictions  financial ratios and other financial and operating tests 
the company s ability to comply with any of the foregoing restrictions and with loan repayment provisions will depend upon its future profit and loss performance and financial position  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including some factors entirely beyond the control of the company 
a failure to comply with any of these obligations could result in an event of default under one or more such financing agreements  which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain of the company s debt  as well as the possible termination of aircraft operating leases 
such an event could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position 
as previously disclosed by the company  possible business combinations with other entities have been considered 
the company intends to continue to evaluate such potential combinations 
it is possible that the company will enter into a transaction in the future that would result in a merger or other change in control of the company 
the company s current credit facility and certain unsecured term debt may be accelerated upon such a merger or consolidation 
in some circumstances  this acceleration could limit potential business combinations 
the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards and investment and other tax credit carryforwards which may  depending upon the circumstances  be available to reduce future federal income taxes payable 
if the company undergoes an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  the company s potential future utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and investment tax credit carryforwards could be impaired 
the actual effect of this impairment on the company would depend upon a number of factors  including the profitability of the company and the timing of the sale of certain assets  some of which factors may be beyond the control of the company 
the impact on the company of such a limitation could be materially adverse under certain circumstances 
the vast majority of the company s scheduled service and charter business  other than us military  is leisure travel 
since leisure travel is largely discretionary spending on the part of the company s customers  the company s results of operations can be adversely affected by economic conditions which reduce discretionary purchases 
the company is subject to the risk that one or more customers who have contracted with the company will cancel or default on such contracts and that the company might be unable in such circumstances to obtain other business to replace the resulting loss in revenues 
the company s largest single customer is the us military  which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated revenues in and no other single customer of the company accounts for more than of operating revenues 
approximately two thirds of the company s operating revenues are sold by travel agents and tour operators who generally have a choice of airlines when booking a customer s travel 
although the company intends to offer attractive and competitive products to travel agents and tour operators and further intends to maintain favorable relationships with them  any significant actions by large numbers of travel agencies or tour operators to favor other airlines  or to disfavor the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s airline businesses are significantly affected by seasonal factors 
typically  the company experiences reduced demand for leisure travel during the second and fourth quarters of each year 
in recent years  the company has experienced its most robust demand in the first and third quarters 
as a result  the company s results of operations for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the company s annual results of operations 
the airline industry as a whole  and scheduled service in particular  is characterized by high fixed costs of operation 
the high fixed cost of operating a flight does not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried  and therefore the revenue impact of a small increase or decrease in average passenger load factor could  in the aggregate  have a significant effect on the profitability of those flights 
accordingly  a relatively minor shortfall in scheduled service load factor and associated revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company faces intense competition from other airlines in many of its scheduled service markets  including other low fare airlines 
the future actions of existing and potential competitors in all of the company s scheduled service markets  including changes in prices and seat capacity offered  could have a material effect on the profit performance of this business unit 
jet fuel comprises a significant percentage of the total operating expenses of the company  accounting for and  respectively  of operating expenses in and fuel prices are subject to factors which are beyond the control of the company  such as market supply and demand conditions  and political or economic factors 
although the company is able to contractually pass through some fuel price increases to the us military and tour operators  a significant increase in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s services at profitable prices 
in june  the company s flight attendants elected the afa as their representative and ratified a four year collective bargaining agreement in december in june  the company s cockpit crews elected the ibt as their representative and ratified a four year collective bargaining agreement in september the company believes that its relations with employee groups are good 
however  the existence of a significant labor dispute with any sizeable group of employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is subject to regulation under the jurisdictions of the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration and by certain other governmental agencies  such as the federal communications commission  the commerce department  the customs service  the immigration and naturalization service  the animal and plant inspection service of the department of agriculture  and the environmental protection agency 
these agencies propose and issue regulations from time to time which can significantly increase the cost of airline operations 
for example  the faa in recent years has issued a number of aircraft maintenance directives and other regulations requiring action by the company on such matters as collision avoidance systems  airborne wind shear avoidance systems  noise abatement  airworthiness of aging aircraft and increased inspection requirements 
other laws and regulations have been considered from time to time that would prohibit or restrict the ownership and or transfer of airline routes and takeoff or landing slots at certain airports 
the company cannot predict the nature of future changes in laws or regulations to which it may become subject  and such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
in  the company was granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the dot pursuant to section of the federal aviation act authorizing it to engage in air transportation 
the faa further requires the company to obtain an operating certificate and operations specifications authorizing the company to fly to specific airports using specific equipment 
all of the company s aircraft must also maintain certificates of airworthiness issued by the faa 
the company holds an faa air operating certificate under part of the federal aviation regulations 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all requirements necessary to maintain in good standing its operating authority granted by the dot and its air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa 
a modification  suspension or revocation of any of the company s dot or faa authorizations or certificates could have a material adverse effect on the company 
under current dot regulations with respect to charter transportation originating in the united states  all charter airline tickets must generally be paid for in cash  and all funds received from the sale of charter seats and in some cases ground arrangements must be placed into escrow by the tour operator or be protected by a surety bond meeting prescribed standards 
the company currently provides an unlimited third party bond in order to meet these regulations 
the issuer of the bond has the right to terminate the bond on days notice 
if this bond were to be materially limited or canceled  the company would be required to escrow funds to comply with dot regulations  which could materially reduce the company s liquidity and require it to fund higher levels of working capital 
the company is currently preparing its software systems and hardware components for operational compliance with year standards 
the company believes  based upon its assessment of year readiness  that it has developed a year project plan which  if successfully completed  will mitigate all significant risks of business and operational disruption arising from non compliant computer components 
successful completion of this plan is dependent upon the availability to the company of a wide range of technical skills from both internal and external sources  and is also dependent upon the availability of purchased software and hardware components 
the company cannot be assured that such resources and components can be acquired in the quantities needed  or by the times needed  to successfully complete the year project plan  in which case it is possible that the company could suffer serious disruptions to business processes and operations as a consequence of system failures attributable to the year problem 
such disruptions could impair the company s ability to operate its flight schedule  and could impose significant economic penalties on the company by increasing the cost of operations through the temporary loss of efficiencies provided by computer software and hardware 
in addition  the company cannot be assured that domestic and foreign air transportation infrastructure  such as airports and air traffic control systems  will be fully compliant with year requirements by the end of a significant lack of readiness of the air transportation infrastructure to meet year standards could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition by imposing serious limitations on the company s ability to operate its flight schedule 
the company is subject to potential financial losses which may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident  including the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its subsequent loss from service  and the potential claims of injured passengers and others 
under dot regulations  the company maintains liability insurance on all aircraft 
although the company currently believes that its insurance coverage is adequate  there can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will be sufficient or that the company will not be required to bear substantial financial losses from an accident 
substantial claims from such an accident could result in a material adverse change in the company s financial position and could seriously inhibit customer acceptance of the company s services
