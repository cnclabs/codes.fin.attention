international sales are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties in homologating products in other countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  and potentially adverse tax consequences  which may in the future contribute to fluctuations in the company s business and operating results

a significant portion of the company s business is derived from substantial orders placed by large end users and telephone companies  and the timing of such orders could cause material fluctuations in the company s business and operating results 
for example  in the quarter ended december   the company experienced a shortfall in revenues as compared to its expectations  which was due primarily to lower than expected revenues from certain domestic carriers 
gross profit gross profit increased by in to million from million for gross margin decreased to of net sales in as compared to in this decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the above referenced price reductions  which were somewhat offset by a shift in the mix of products sold to include more broadband products  which generally have higher gross margins than narrowband products

this decrease in gross margin in was primarily due to the above referenced price reductions  and to a lesser extent  a shift in the mix of products sold to include more narrowband products  which generally have lower gross margins than broadband products 
a significant portion of the company s business is very price competitive  which has in the past and will in the future require the company to lower its prices  resulting in fluctuations in the company s business and operating results 
the company anticipates that this pricing pressure will continue at least through the end of in addition  the company anticipates that its mix of products sold will change to include a higher percentage of narrowband products  which generally have lower gross margins and would therefore adversely affect the company s overall gross margins

as a result  the company incurred a net loss in the third quarter of a significant portion of the company s business is derived from substantial orders placed by large end users and telephone companies 
the timing of such orders can  in general  cause material fluctuations in the company s operating results and was of particular significance in the fourth quarter of where weaker than expected demand from certain domestic carrier customers together with expense levels geared in expectation of higher revenue levels combined to produce a net loss 
the company has in the past hired more of its sg a personnel primarily within the sales and marketing organizations  and incurred increased expenses related to trade shows and other promotional activities  during the first half of the year 
in the first half of  the company increased its sales organization personnel in anticipation of increased revenue opportunities 
a significant portion of the company s business is very price competitive  which has in the past and will in the future require the company to lower its prices  resulting in fluctuations in the company s business and operating results 
for example  periodically throughout and in the first half of  the company reduced the prices on some of its access products to address competitive pricing pressures  which adversely affected the company s gross margins during and the company anticipates that this increased pricing pressure will continue at least through in addition  the mix of products sold may continue to change to include a higher percentage of narrowband products that generally have lower gross margins and would therefore adversely affect the company s overall gross margins 
other factors that may cause fluctuations in the company s operating results include the loss of  or difference in actual from anticipated levels of purchases from  the company s major customers  seasonal capital spending patterns of large domestic customers  changes in sales volumes through the company s distribution channels  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  availability and cost of components from the company s suppliers and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenue 
the company typically operates with limited order backlog  and a substantial majority of its revenues in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
if revenue levels are below expectations  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner  which would adversely affect operating results 
liquidity and capital resources with the exception of million that the company received from the sale of preferred stock in  through the company financed its operations and capital equipment requirements primarily from cash flows from operations 
in early  the company sold approximately  shares of common stock at a price per share of in its initial public offering 
the company has added the net proceeds of that offering to working capital  where such proceeds are available to support general corporate purposes 
the company s working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  the company s cash  cash equivalents and long and short term marketable securities decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company paid million for certain assets of performance telecom in the third quarter of  accounting for much of the decline in cash  cash equivalents and long and short term marketable securities at the end of the decline in net cash provided by operating activities from to was largely due to a shortfall in the fourth quarter of in net sales as discussed under results of operations net sales and quarterly results of operations  and the related decline in net income for in addition  investments were made in inventory during in anticipation of higher levels of net sales that did not materialize 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of net income  a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable and accrued payroll and other accrued expenses  offset to some extent by increased inventories 
to date  the company has not experienced any material inventory obsolescence as a result of new product development  but there can be no assurance that future product development efforts will not render company products obsolete 
leasehold improvements and capital equipment additions were million in  million in  and million in net cash used in financing activities amounted to  in as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  and  in and respectively  primarily from the proceeds of employee stock options and purchases 
the use of cash in financing activities in was due primarily to the company s repurchase of million of its common stock  offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
in october  the company s board of directors announced the authorization for the company to repurchase up to  shares of common stock for cash from time to time at market prices and as market and business conditions warrant  in open market  negotiated or block transactions  at which time the stock will be retired 
no time limit was set for completion of the program 
the company purchased  shares of common stock under this program in at a cost of  the company believes that existing cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
other factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the factors set forth above in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  there are a number of other factors that may affect the company s future operating results 
operating results may fluctuate  absence of significant backlog the company believes that the loss of  or difference in actual from anticipated levels of purchases from  the company s major customers could in the future affect operating results 
other factors that may cause fluctuations in the company s operating results include  but are not limited to  seasonal capital spending patterns of large domestic customers  changes in the product mix sold toward narrowband products that yield lower gross margins  completion of the build out of carrier and isp infrastructures  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company and its competitors  changes in sales volumes through the company s distribution channels  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  availability and cost of components from the company s suppliers and economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue 
the company operates with limited order backlog  and a substantial majority of its revenues in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
if revenue levels are below expectations  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner which would adversely affect operating results 
the company s industry has in the last several years been characterized by declining prices on existing products  therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
market for the company s products is highly competitive the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets 
in addition  the company faces competition from suppliers of internetworking equipment  such as routers  and telephone equipment  such as switches  which are including a direct wan interface in certain of their products 
an increased reliance by customers on such suppliers for wan access would reduce demand for the company s products  which would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and operating results 
as discussed above  increased competition has also placed increasing pressures on the pricing of the company s products  which has resulted in lower operating results 
the company anticipates that this pricing pressure will continue at least through company depends on key personnel the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon the continued contributions of members of the company s senior management and other key personnel  and upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  the competition for whom is intense 
certain of the company s key management personnel have only recently joined the company and certain personnel have only limited experience in the company s industry 
in february  alan i 
fraser  the company s president and chief executive officer  resigned to pursue other interests 
vinita gupta  chairman of the board  assumed the responsibilities of president and chief executive officer upon mr 
fraser s departure  and the company recently began searching for an individual to succeed ms 
gupta as president and chief executive officer 
in addition  the company is searching for a vice president  sales 
the current availability of qualified sales and engineering personnel is quite limited  and competition among companies for such personnel is intense 
the company is currently attempting to hire a number of sales and engineering personnel and has experienced delays in filling such positions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel to hold these important positions 
company must respond to technological change the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing wan access products and dl products formerly known as the w atm gateway products in a timely manner and to identify  develop and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and meet customer needs in the wan access market 
any failure by the company to anticipate or to respond adequately to competitive solutions  technological developments in its industry  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  or any significant delays in the development  introduction or shipment of products  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that product delays will not result in missed market opportunities 
in addition  customers could refrain from purchasing the company s existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors 
new products could also render certain of the company s existing products obsolete 
either of these events could materially adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
risks of company s involvement with products for emerging markets the company is currently developing and may in the future develop products with which the company has only limited experience and or that are targeted at emerging market segments  including the company s dl product 
the company has experienced delays in the development of the dl product  in part related to technical problems that required some software to be redesigned 
this became available for revenue shipments in the second half of the company has experienced very limited customer interest to date of this product in the marketplace 
the company does not anticipate that the dl revenue will become a significant portion of the company s revenue until at least given its complexity  there can be no assurance that this product will not encounter further technical or other difficulties that could significantly delay its deployment or acceptance or could result in the termination of the development program for this product 
there can be no assurance that the market for atm infrastructure products will continue to develop  the dl will meet the needs of the emerging atm market or any other market or  that products currently available or under development by competitors would not directly compete with the dl product 
the occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with acquisitions the company completed an acquisition of performance telecom in the third quarter of and may complete additional acquisitions in the future 
the process of integrating an acquired company s business into the company s operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of the company s business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will be realized 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in managing diverse geographic sales and research and development operations  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  difficulties in the assimilation of the technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
the inability of the company s management to respond to changing business conditions effectively  including the changes associated with its recent acquisition  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its operations  including the development of cost estimates for  and the extent of programming changes required to address  this issue 
although final cost estimates have yet to be determined  it is anticipated that these year costs will not be material to the company expenses during and the company doe not currently have any information concerning the year compliance status of its suppliers and customers 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
legal proceedings in april  a class action complaint was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the santa clara superior court of the state of california  alleging violations of the california corporations code and california civil code 
in october  a similar parallel lawsuit against the company and the same individuals was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
the class period in both of these lawsuits runs from september  through december   and both complaints allege that the defendants concealed and or misrepresented material adverse information about the company and that the individual defendants sold shares of the company s stock based upon material nonpublic information 
the complaints seek unspecified monetary damages 
to date  the superior court has dismissed portions of plaintiff s state court complaint without leave to amend 
the superior court also dismissed five of the individual defendants without leave to amend and another individual defendant with leave to amend 
the superior court also denied motions to dismiss filed by the company and two other individual defendants with respect to the remaining portions of the complaint 
plaintiff has filed a third amended complaint that names the company and three individual defendants 
discovery to date has been limited in the state court action  and the superior court has not set a trial date 
the company also moved to dismiss the federal complaint 
on september   the court granted the company s motion to dismiss 
the court granted plaintiff leave to file  and plaintiff has filed  an amended complaint 
the company has moved to dismiss the amended complaint 
there has been no discovery in the federal action  and no trial date has been set 
the company believes that both actions are without merit and intends to defend both actions vigorously 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and  thus  there can be no assurance that these lawsuits will be resolved favorably to the company or that they will not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in the accompanying financial statements 
risk of third party claims of infringement the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
for example  a third party has on several occasions expressed its belief that certain of the company s products  including its csu dsus  may infringe upon patents held by it and has suggested on such occasions that the company acquire a license to such patents 
the company believes that a license  to the extent required  will be available  however  no assurance can be given that the terms of any offered license would be favorable to the company 
should a license be unavailable  the company could be required to discontinue the sale of or to redesign certain of its products 
in addition  larscom  a competitor of the company  has continued to express its belief that the company s inverse multiplexer products may infringe a patent jointly owned by larscom and a third party and has suggested that the company acquire a license to the patent 
the company does not believe that there is merit to larscom s claim 
management  after review and consultation with counsel  believes that the ultimate resolution of both these allegations is uncertain and there can be no assurance that these assertions will be resolved without costly litigation or in a manner that is not adverse to the company 
while the company accrued certain amounts for these matters in prior years  it is currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss regarding these matters 
therefore  the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in payments in excess of the amounts accrued in the accompanying financial statements and require royalty payments in the future which could adversely impact gross margins 
there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or that the company will prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
possible adverse changes in future market price the risks outlined herein are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially affect the company s operating results and stock price for one quarter or a series of quarters 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
