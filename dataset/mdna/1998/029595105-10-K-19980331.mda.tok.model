impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost has not been estimated  but is not expected to be material 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company

liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  compared to  at december  the company s cash position decreased  due primarily to the company s debt payment requirements and working capital needs 
restricted cash at december  and december  reflects cash that may only be used for the operations of gk financing  llc 
the increase in restricted cash is due to cash flow from gamma knife operations 
on may   the company repurchased the notes repurchase for cash and securities approximately of its outstanding senior subordinated notes subordinated notes 
the notes repurchase  together with a december lease restructuring and the availability of up to  of new debt financing  concluded a broad restructuring of the company s obligations as more fully explained in the company s form k 
on december  and march   the company further restructured certain of its medical equipment leases and related notes the ge notes to extend the terms of the leases for periods of up to an additional months  to defer certain monthly lease payments and to defer certain installment payments due at the beginning of this further restructuring resulted in payment reductions of approximately  for the company in and subsequent years 
the various restructuring transactions described above cured all of the company s then outstanding defaults relating to its debt and lease obligations 
the company nevertheless remains highly leveraged and has significant cash payment requirements under its equipment leases and credit facilities 
scheduled equipment capital lease payments and operating lease payments during the months ending december  are  and  respectively  with related maintenance commitments of approximately  scheduled interest and principal payments under the company s other debt obligations during such period are approximately  which excludes the company s revolving line of credit balance of  at december   at february  whose maturity has been extended to may  although the company s operating performance has improved  the company is uncertain it will have the cash resources to pay all of its obligations when they are due 
accordingly  the company will continue its program of expense reductions  revenue enhancements and asset sales as well as refinancing or renegotiating the terms of its fixed obligations program 
the company s ability to meet its obligations when due are dependent upon the success of the company s program 
any inability of the company to meet its obligations when due would result in a default which could permit the relevant obligor to accelerate the obligations and seek other remedies including seizure of the company s medical imaging equipment 
in such event  the company would be forced to seek a liquidation under chapter or a reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as part of the program  the company in march sold its modesto buildings for  in cash  and negotiated an increase in its working capital line of credit to  and extended its maturity date by two years to may  the company also completed in august an exchange offer the exchange offer for  aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes 
the purpose of the exchange offer was to improve the company s capital structure and relieve the company of the requirement to pay  of principal and interest in october  when the subordinated notes were to mature 
in the exchange offer  the company issued approximately  additional shares of common stock for  principal amount of subordinated notes 
the remaining  of the subordinated notes was paid at maturity on october  in the long term  the company believes that it must respond to fundamental changes in the industry 
the medical diagnostic imaging business  both mobile and fixed  is in a period of consolidation as a result of the growth of managed care and other competitive forces 
smaller companies  such as the company  must either grow through acquisitions or become part of larger enterprises in order to compete successfully and achieve acceptable returns for their shareholders 
in light of the unavailability of capital to the company and continuing weakness in the price of its common stock  the company has been willing to entertain acquisition offers 
in late and early  the company unsuccessfully pursued a merger with a larger industry participant 
in late  the company was approached by alliance imaging  inc  another major industry participant  with respect to a sale of the company s medical diagnostic imaging business 
on march  the company and alliance entered into an agreement under which the company would sell its medical diagnostic imaging assets to alliance for consideration consisting of cash and the assumption of related liabilities 
see part i  item business general recent developments 
the company accepted the proposed transaction in response to the industry trend toward consolidation  the increasingly difficult competitive environment for smaller participants  such as the company  and to provide capital for the expansion of the company s radiosurgery services business 
there can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated 
if the transaction is not consummated  the company will be required to continue to operate as an independent entity  and to face the serious liquidity and other problems referred to above 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company does not believe inflation has had a significant impact on operations  because most of its customer contracts include a cost of living price adjustment provision  which the company believes will be sufficient to offset the impact of any future inflation on the company s costs of operation
