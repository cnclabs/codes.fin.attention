a portion of the hotels purchased in were financed with proceeds from the company s line of credit which was ultimately repaid with prepayable floating rate mortgages 
such debt financing in gave rise to the million of interest expense referred to above  versus zero for pro forma  when the company did not use third party debt 
the substantial increase in the number of hotels owned by the company has also proportionately increased the company s general expense levels  including depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses 
net income in was million per share and cad for the period was million per share  based in both cases on average outstanding shares for the period of  this compares with pro forma net income of million per share and cad of million per share  based in both cases upon  outstanding shares

the debt was provided by hrp at rates which were lower than the market rates which the company would have paid on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  the company does not believe that its results of operations while it was a wholly owned subsidiary of hrp are comparable to subsequent periods

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash to fund its dividends  interest and day to day operations is the base and percentage rent it receives 
base rent is paid monthly in advance and percentage rent is paid either monthly or quarterly in arrears 
this flow of funds from rent has historically been sufficient for the company to pay dividends  interest and meet day to day operating expenses 
the company believes that its operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses  interest and dividend payments 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs which may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and the need to pay dividends or operating expenses  the company has entered into a line of credit arrangement with dlj mortgage capital  inc dljmc 
the line of credit the dljmc line of credit is for up to million  all of which was available at december  during the company expanded its credit facilities with dljmc temporarily to provide up to million 
drawings under the dljmc line of credit are secured by first mortgage liens on certain of the company s hotels 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
the dljmc line of credit matures on december  interest on borrowings under the dljmc line of credit are payable until maturity at a spread above libor  and interest during the extended term  if any  will be set at market rates at the time the loan is extended 
during  subsidiaries of the company issued million of mortgage notes the secured notes secured by such subsidiaries assets  including residence inn by marriott r and wyndham garden r hotels 
the mortgage loan was financed by the issuance of million commercial mortgage pass through certificates through a trust created by another of the company s subsidiaries 
the certificates were sold in a rule a private placement to institutional investors 
the secured notes carried interest that floated with one month libor plus a spread and were due december   but could be prepaid by the company at any time without penalty 
in connection with this issuance of the secured notes  the company entered into interest rate cap agreements for million notional amount with a major financial institution which limit the company s maximum interest rate exposure to on this debt 
on march   the secured notes were prepaid in full 
the company expects to use existing cash balances  borrowings under the dljmc line of credit or other lines of credit and or net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future hotel acquisitions 
to the extent the company borrows on a line of credit  the company will explore various alternatives in both the timing and method of repayment of such amounts 
such alternatives may include incurring long term debt 
on january   the company s shelf registration statement for up to billion of securities  including debt securities  was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
an effective shelf registration statement enables the company to issue specific securities to the public on an expedited basis by filing a prospectus supplement with the sec 
in february the company issued million of senior unsecured notes due net proceeds to the company of approximately million were used for general business purposes and  on march  to repay the secured notes in full 
also in february the company issued an aggregate  shares in connection with three separate unit investment trust arrangements established by investment banks 
these shares were sold at market prices less an underwriting discount 
the aggregate net proceeds of these shares offerings million will be used for the acquisition of additional hotels and for general business purposes 
at march  the company had total commitments to purchase property of million 
also at march  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the company is in the process of negotiating with a commercial bank for an unsecured revolving credit facility 
the company expects to conclude negotiations and documentation during the first half of  enter into a new unsecured revolving line of credit and terminate the dljmc line of credit 
no assurance can be given that a new credit facility will be available to the company on acceptable terms 
although there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  the company believes it will have access to various types of financing in the future  including debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions 
recent developments on march  the company closed a new unsecured revolving credit facility of million  arranged and fully underwritten by a commercial bank 
the facility has a year term and bears interest at libor plus a spread based on the company s senior debt ratings 
the facility contains financial covenants requiring the company to  among other things  maintain a debt to asset value as defined of no more than and meet certain debt service coverage ratios as defined 
on march  the company completed a million acquisition of summerfield suites r hotels  containing  suites  rooms 
these hotels are leased to the seller under a lease with an initial term through and four renewal terms of years each 
the lease requires base rent of million annually and additional rent equal to a percentage of gross revenue increases beginning in the acquisition was funded with a million borrowing under the company s unsecured credit line discussed above and cash on hand 
seasonality the company s hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause fluctuations in the company s rental income because the company believes that the revenues generated by its hotels will be sufficient for the lessees to pay rents on a regular basis notwithstanding seasonal fluctuations 
inflation the company believes that inflation should not have a material adverse effect on the company 
although increases in the rate of inflation may tend to increase interest rates which the company may be required to pay for borrowed funds  the company has a policy of obtaining interest rate caps in appropriate circumstances to protect it from interest rate increases 
in addition  the company s leases provide for the payment of percentage rent to the company based on increases in total sales  and such rent should increase with inflation 
certain considerations the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions and contains certain statements of the company s beliefs  intent or expectation concerning projections  plans  future events and performance 
the estimates  assumptions and statements  such as those relating to the company s ability to expand its portfolio  performance of its assets  the ability to pay dividends  its tax status as a real estate investment trust  the ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity and to access capital markets  depend upon various factors over which the company and or the company s lessees have or may have limited or no control 
those factors include  without limitation  the status of the economy  capital markets including prevailing interest rates  compliance with the changes to regulations within the hospitality industry  competition  changes to federal  state and local legislation and other factors 
the company cannot predict the impact of these factors  if any 
however  these factors could cause the company s actual results for subsequent periods to be different from those stated  estimated or assumed in this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and prudent at this time
