as of december   the company had not achieved any of the above milestones  and it is unlikely that the company will achieve the last two milestones in the foreseeable future 
the revolver provides for up to million in advances based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   the company could have borrowed approximately million under this revolver 
this revolver can be increased to million in the event that the company achieves one of the milestones  but elects not to draw the second advance under the term loan

the company is current on all its obligations  however  there is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash flow from product sales to liquidate liabilities as they become due

in the event the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from product sales  equity financings and borrowings under the revolver planned operations will need to be scaled back and the company may be unable to liquidate its liabilities on a timely basis
