item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information in this review  along with the business segment data shown on page  reflects the company s continuing operations 
results of operations fiscal compared with sales in fiscal increased percent while net income decreased percent 
net income for fiscal included fourth quarter restructuring and other one time charges of million million after tax 
excluding these charges  net income increased percent 
restructuring charges of million million after tax were incurred for reduction of personnel and write off or write down of assets related to the exit of several product lines 
in connection with the restructure  the company currently expects a total work force reduction of approximately  employees 
of that number  were terminated prior to year end 
fiscal income also includes a provision of million million after tax for costs related to an international contract of the electronic systems segment 
this provision relates to additional contract costs incurred in the fourth quarter and asian currency problems 
segment results  as discussed below  exclude the fiscal restructuring and one time charge 
communications segment sales increased percent while net income increased percent 
significant sales and earnings improvement in the segment s digital switch and telephone test equipment businesses helped offset the impact of substantially lower earnings in the segment s microwave radio business  due to the slowdown in the pcs market 
segment earnings also benefited from substantially higher gains from the sale of investment securities and higher royalty income 
semiconductor segment sales increased percent as record volume shipments were offset in part by lower product prices 
excluding restructuring expense  segment net income increased percent 
royalty income  which is significant for both years  was lower in fiscal restructuring actions will reduce the segment s workforce by approximately percent and once completed  these actions should reduce annual operating costs by to million  much of which should occur in time to benefit fiscal lanier worldwide segment sales increased percent in fiscal due to growth in both domestic and international markets 
segment net income increased percent due to higher sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  lanier worldwide entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the copying systems business of the agfa gevaert group 
the transaction was completed in the first quarter of fiscal and should increase the segment s sales by more than million annually 
the acquisition will double lanier s presence and market share in the european office equipment market 
electronic systems segment sales were percent lower in fiscal  while net income declined percent 
reduced sales in the segment s air traffic control and aerospace systems businesses more than offset growth in the segment s information systems business 
lower sales  higher interest expense and gain from the sale of a building in fiscal contributed to the fiscal earnings decline 
cost of sales  rentals and services as a percentage of sales increased to percent from percent in the prior year 
both the electronic systems and lanier worldwide segments had lower operating margins in the current fiscal year 
engineering  selling  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in the current year 
lower marketing expense helped offset a small increase in company sponsored research and development 
interest income was higher in fiscal due to interest received from the internal revenue service 
interest expense was also higher in fiscal due to higher average borrowings and a lower amount of interest capitalized on new construction projects 
other net expense was million lower in fiscal due to gains resulting from the sale of investment securities 
the provision for income taxes in both fiscal and was percent of income before income taxes

substantially all of this investment in rental equipment is related to lanier worldwide products 
fiscal compared with sales in fiscal increased percent while net income increased percent 
communications segment sales increased percent and net income increased percent 
the segment benefited from strong sales and earnings growth in its microwave systems business  as well as lower tax rates 
significant gains from the sale of investment securities were substantially offset by very poor performance in the segment s digital switch business 
this poor performance relates to high margin orders expected in fiscal which were delayed until fiscal improvement in the digital switch business coupled with expected strong performance in the microwave systems and broadcast products businesses should result in higher sales and earnings in fiscal semiconductor segment sales were percent lower than last year while net income increased percent 
lower earnings for the segment s discrete power and digital products were offset by improved margins for intelligent power products and significantly increased royalty income 
improving market conditions for the industry and increased manufacturing capacity is expected to result in a significant increase in fiscal sales  and higher earnings 
lanier worldwide segment sales and net income increased percent and percent  respectively 
sales in european markets were adversely affected by currency fluctuations  while both domestic and international margins increased due to the favorable impact of sourcing yen based products 
this segment expects both improved sales and earnings in fiscal sales for the electronic systems segment were percent higher than the prior year due to growth in its information systems business 
net income for the year increased percent over last year due to higher margins for the segment s core defense products and reduced losses in its energy management business which was transferred to a joint venture in january of earnings in fiscal include a gain from the sale of a building which was substantially offset by write offs on certain long term contracts 
while the segment continues to adjust to reduced appropriations in its core defense business  fiscal sales are expected to be slightly higher than the prior year with a moderate decrease in earnings 
cost of sales  rentals  and services as a percentage of sales decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
for the current year  cost ratios were lower in the semiconductor segment due to significantly increased royalty income  and the lanier segment due to favorable currency exchange rates 
engineering  selling  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from percent in fiscal to percent in the current year 
lower administrative costs were offset by increased marketing expenses and company sponsored research and development 
interest income and expense were slightly lower for the year as additional interest on borrowed funds used for major new construction projects has been capitalized as a component of plant and equipment under construction 
other net expense was million lower in fiscal due to gains resulting from the sale of investment securities and a gain on the sale of a building 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was percent of income before income taxes compared to percent in fiscal the reduction from the statutory us income tax rate of percent in resulted from tax benefits associated with foreign income and export sales 
capital expenditures expenditures for land  buildings  and equipment totaled million in  up from million in the prior year 
in addition  during fiscal  million was invested in equipment for rental to customers  up from million invested in the prior year 
substantially all of this investment in rental equipment is related to lanier worldwide products 
financial condition cash position at july   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase from million at june  marketable securities were million at july  receivables  unbilled costs  and inventories notes and accounts receivable amounted to  million at july   unchanged from a year earlier

year issue certain software and hardware systems are time sensitive 
older time sensitive systems often use a two digit dating convention eg  rather than that could result in system failure and disruption of operations as the year approaches 
the year problem will impact the company  its vendors and suppliers  customers  and other third parties that interface with the company 
with regard to the year problem  more than project initiatives of varying magnitudes have been identified throughout the company and its various business segments 
each project has been assigned a leader and prioritized based on the size of the task and the perceived business risk 
a steering team comprised of senior management in key functional areas including accounting  finance  legal  quality new processes and information management has been established to monitor and oversee the progress of each project 
some of these projects have been completed and a substantial number are steadily progressing 
the company has determined it needs to replace or modify several of its software systems and is in the process of replacing or outsourcing many of its time sensitive software systems 
in addition  the company has software programs for reprogramming other time sensitive software and equipment 
the company has initiated formal programs to advise and work with customers to resolve year problems 
however  the company believes it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company has year exposure in its operating systems and business systems  including engineering  manufacturing  order fulfillment  program management  financial and administrative functions 
it is the company s belief that the greatest potential risk from the year issue could be its inability to meet commitment dates on delivery of product and has focused the majority of the company s effort and dedicated resources to address this issue 
in addition  the company believes that a limited number of the non information technology systems  such as manufacturing machinery  equipment and test equipment with date sensitive software and embedded microprocessors may be affected  and evaluation and remediation are underway 
the company has also initiated communications with significant suppliers  customers and other relevant third parties to identify and minimize disruptions to the company s operations and to assist in resolving year issues 
however  there can be no certainty that the systems and products of other companies on which the company relies will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes it is diligently addressing the year issues and that it will satisfactorily resolve significant year problems 
the company anticipates completing substantially all of its year projects during fiscal  with major completion milestones being targeted for the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in the event the company falls short of these milestones  additional internal resources will be focused on completing these projects or developing contingency plans 
the estimated cost for resolving year issues is approximately million with approximately million planned for fiscal these costs are generally not incremental to existing information technology budgets  internal resources were re deployed and time tables for implementation of replacement systems were accelerated 
the largest portion of this expenditure is being used to replace existing software and hardware 
estimates of year related costs are based on numerous assumptions and there is no certainty that estimates will be achieved and actual costs could be materially greater than anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the continuing availability of personnel trained in this area  the ability to timely identify and correct all relevant computer programs  and similar uncertainties 
euro conversion on january   certain member nations of the european economic and monetary union emu will adopt a common currency  the euro 
for a three year transition period  both the euro and individual participants currencies will remain in circulation 
after january   the euro will be the sole legal tender for emu countries 
the adoption of the euro will affect a multitude of financial systems and business applications as the commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro and the existing national currency 
for the year ended july   approximately percent of the company s revenues were derived from emu countries 
the company is currently addressing euro related issues and its impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
action plans currently being implemented are expected to result in compliance with all laws and regulations  however  there can be no certainty that such plans will be successfully implemented or that external factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
any costs associated with the adoption of the euro will be expensed as incurred and the company does not expect these costs to be material to its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
outlook overall  the company believes the fourth quarter restructuring actions  along with continuing investment in new products and services  should enable the company to grow revenues and earnings in fiscal however  revenue growth will be difficult in the first half due to on going weakness in the semiconductor market  softness in the north american microwave radio market  and economic instability in the international markets served by the company s communications businesses 
in the communications segment  continuing improvement in the digital switch business coupled with expected strong performance in its other businesses  particularly microwave and broadcast products  should result in higher sales in fiscal earnings in this segment are expected to be relatively flat as higher operating income is expected to be offset by lower gains from the sale of investment securities 
restructuring actions are expected to help the semiconductor segment remain profitable in the face of difficult market conditions and be well positioned when the industry eventually turns around 
lower operating costs in the lanier segment  resulting from fiscal restructuring actions  and higher sales are expected to result in improved earnings 
the electronic systems segment expects relatively flat sales and a strong increase in fiscal earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the market value of its equity securities available for sale  and changes in interest rates 
the company employs established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company uses foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off balance sheet foreign currency commitments 
specifically  these foreign exchange contracts offset foreign currency denominated inventory and purchase commitments from suppliers  accounts receivable from and future committed sales to customers  intercompany loans  and firm committed operating expenses in malaysia and ireland 
management believes the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks which arise from doing business in international markets 
contracts are generally one year or less 
at july   the company had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  of which million were to hedge off balance sheet commitments 
additionally  for the fiscal year ended july   the company purchased and sold  million of foreign exchange forward and option contracts 
reference is made to the note financial instruments in the notes to financial statements for further information with respect to commitments to buy or sell foreign currencies 
the company s hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a percent adverse change in currency exchange rates for the company s foreign currency derivatives held july   would have an impact of approximately million on the fair value of such instruments 
this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of the company s foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
the company also maintains a portfolio of marketable equity securities available for sale 
these investments result from the funding of start up companies that have technology or products that are of interest to the company 
the fair market value of these securities at july   was million with the corresponding unrealized gain included as a component of shareholders equity 
these investments have historically had higher volatility than most market indices 
a percent adverse change in the quoted market price of marketable equity securities would have an impact of approximately million on the fair market value of these securities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
