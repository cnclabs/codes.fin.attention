when used in this report  the words believes  anticipates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statement as a result of the matters discussed in this report generally 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
in the following analysis  management discusses broadcast cash flow 
broadcast cash flow should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  operating income  net income or cash flow and other consolidated income or cash flow statement data computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of the company s profitability or liquidity 
although this measure of performance is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it is widely used in the broadcasting industry as a measure of a company s operating performance 
broadcast cash flow assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis across companies without regard to depreciation and amortization  which can vary significantly depending on accounting methods particularly where acquisitions are involved 
it also excludes non operating factors such as historical cost bases  and the effect of corporate general and administrative expenses  which generally do not relate directly to the performance of broadcasting entities 
the performance of a broadcasting group  such as the company  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the primary source of the company s revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on its stations for advertising 
the company also generates revenue through the sale of broadcasting time on non owned radio stations in exchange for providing syndicated programming and comprehensive radio research services to the stations  by providing sales representation services to third parties  and through syndicated program fees 
the company s significant operating expenses are employee salaries  sports broadcasting rights fees  programming expenses  advertising and promotion expenses  rental of premises for studios and transmitting equipment and music license royalty fees 
jacor has installed company wide general ledger accounting software to assist local management in measuring and controlling operating expenses 
the company s radio station revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates the company s stations are able to charge 
these rates are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as principally measured by arbitron metro area ratings surveys 
jacor communications  inc 
and subsidiaries general  continued most advertising contracts are short term and run only for a few weeks 
most of the company s revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold by the station s sales staff 
in  approximately of the company s gross station revenue was from local advertising and approximately was from national advertising 
a station s local sales staff solicits advertising  either directly from the local advertiser or through an advertising agency for the local advertiser 
national advertising sales for most of the company s stations are made by the company s national sales managers in conjunction with the efforts of an independent advertising representative who specializes in national sales and is compensated on a commission only basis 
the company s broadcasting services include the distribution of syndicated programming for radio broadcasting  comprehensive radio research services and a national  in house sales force 
the company generates revenue through the distribution of syndicated programming in two ways i through the sale of broadcasting time on non owned radio stations in exchange for providing syndicated programming to those stations  and ii syndicated program fees 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  premiere radio networks  inc premiere  provides research services  including music play list and on air promotion tracking and call out research  for seven radio formats  in exchange for commercial broadcast inventory instead of on a cash basis in order to make the services more attractive to radio stations which have limited cash resources and or excess commercial broadcast inventory 
premiere sells commercial broadcast inventory to more than national advertisers 
the company leverages its sales force and generates additional revenues without significant additional overhead costs by providing network advertising sales representation services  on a commission basis  to third party networks and independent syndicated programming and service suppliers that do not have their own sales forces 
sports broadcasting and the full service programming features play an integral part in the company s operating strategy 
as a result  because of the rights fees and related costs of broadcasting professional baseball and football  the costs related to the full service programming features of its am radio stations  as well as the company s business strategy to acquire stick properties ie  properties with insignificant ratings and or little or no positive broadcast cash flow  the company s broadcast cash flow margins are typically lower than its competitors 
general economic conditions have an impact on the company s business and financial results 
from time to time the broadcast areas in which the company operates experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect revenue of the company 
however  management believes that this impact is somewhat softened by the company s diverse geographical presence 
the financial results of the company s business are seasonal 
revenues are generally higher in the second  third and fourth calendar quarters than in the first quarter 
jacor communications  inc 
and subsidiaries liquidity and capital resources recent liquidity needs have been driven by the company s acquisition strategy 
the company s acquisitions since have been financed with funds raised through a combination of debt and equity instruments 
an important factor in management financing decisions includes maintenance of leverage ratios consistent with their long term growth strategy 
the company currently has sufficient funds to finance all pending acquisitions with availability to pursue other significant acquisitions 
based upon current levels of the company s operations and anticipated growth  it is expected that operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet expenditures for operations  administrative expenses and debt service related to acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the change between years is due primarily to funds raised for the acquisition of radio stations and broadcasting related service companies 
credit facilities in september  the company entered into a new billion credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions 
the interest rate pricing on the credit facility has been reduced to reflect the company s improved capitalization and current market terms

the credit facility bears interest at a rate that fluctuates with an applicable margin  with a minimum applicable margin to a maximum of  based on the company s ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then most recently ended the leverage ratio  plus a bank base rate or a eurodollar base rate  as applicable
