item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
general the company has developed principally by combining existing businesses  acquiring synergistic technologies and forming strategic business and technological alliances 
as a result of the company s acquisition of telios pharmaceuticals  inc telios in august  the consolidated financial results for and may not be directly comparable 
results of operations compared to the company s net loss increased from million in to million in the loss included two non cash charges totaling million  which are included in general and administrative expense 
total revenues increased from million in to million in as increases in product sales offset decreases in other revenues 
product sales increased from million to million due to million in sales of integra tm artificial skin integra in compared to in the company s export sales increased from million to million as integra export sales increased by  approximately of integra sales in were in north america compared to in  following the product s marketing approval from the fda in march in  burn centers and hospitals throughout north america purchased integra compared to burn centers and hospitals in the company s international sales included integra sales to countries throughout the world 
the primary application of integra has been for patients with severe life threatening burns 
the company is also aware of its application in reconstructive and wound healing procedures and is continuing to focus its strategy on expanding the approved indications for use of integra 
the company believes that integra can offer improved clinical results compared to existing treatments for relief of painful scars  wound contractures and hypertrophic scarring 
the company believes that the following factors will have the greatest influence on the use and sale of integra i physician training prior to product use  ii the collection of pharma economic data to address product reimbursement issues  iii the publication of positive clinical results  and iv the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals for expanded indications 
sales of the company s private label and other medical products decreased from million in to million in decreases in the company s infection control and surgical and hemostasis product lines were offset by increases in its dental product line and other contract manufacturing 
the dental product line increase was the result of increased orders from the company s marketing partner for the biomend product  which was introduced in august the decrease in the surgical and hemostasis product line  which includes products sold to marketing partners and products marketed directly  was due to lower unit volume from international distributors and customers 
during  the company s distribution agreement for its ophthalmic products was terminated  and the company has discontinued the product line 
in january  the company decided to suspend operations at its leased west chester  pennsylvania facility  and as a result has discontinued its avian collagen wound care product line and its contract manufacturing activities 
the company s ophthalmic  avian collagen and contract manufacturing revenues accounted for less than of product sales in and customers representing greater than of sales included two customers equaling in and three customers equaling in because a significant portion of the company s private label and other medical products are sold to marketing partners and distributors  quarter to quarter sales in medical products can vary significantly 
other revenue  which includes grant revenue  license fees  contract development revenue and royalties  declined from million in to  in grant revenue declined by  as a large portion of revenue came from a three year million national institute of standards and technology nist grant which was completed in licensing revenue also declined as the company received a  license fee in in an agreement with cambridge antibody technology limited involving a human antibody development program 
the company expects its other revenues to increase from due to the following i the company has signed a licensing and distribution agreement with century medical  inc for the company s dura regeneration product which included a million licensing fee in march  ii the company has signed a development agreement with johnson johnson professional  inc to develop an absorbable  collagen based implant designed in combination with a proprietary rgd peptide for cartilage regeneration  and iii the company has been awarded a new three year million nist grant to develop absorbable biocompatible polymers in combination with rgd peptides specifically designed to stimulate in vivo cartilage regeneration 
the company continues to seek additional research grants  licensing arrangements and development funding for several of its technologies and programs  although the timing and amount of such revenue  if any  can not be predicted 
cost of product sales increased from million of product sales in to million of product sales in the dollar increase in cost of product sales is due to higher product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of sales decreased due to lower inventory write offs related to certain medical product production difficulties in  improved capacity utilization for integra  and increased sales in higher margin products 
due to the high fixed costs of the manufacturing facility for integra  the company is anticipating higher per unit product costs until there is a requirement for higher production volume 
the company believes its current capacity to produce integra and its other medical products is sufficient to support significant growth  and the utilization of this capacity will affect its gross margin on product sales 
in january  the company decided to discontinue its production operations at the west chester  pennsylvania leased facility 
the company anticipates lower production operating costs during as a result of this closing 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in increases in research and development expenditures associated with clinical costs for the company s post approval study of integra offset declines in pre clinical costs associated the company s absorbable biocompatible polymer program 
continuing expenditures include costs associated with efforts focusing on combining the company s biomaterials technologies with those acquired in the telios acquisition 
the company expects the level of research and development expenditures in to be higher than in as expenditures related to the post approval study for integra continue  and other clinical and pre clinical efforts expand 
these efforts will continue to focus on additional clinical indications for integra and on the company s other regenerative and matrix medicine technologies 
the amount of resources allocated to fund particular research and development efforts will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the progress of development of the company s technologies  changing competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial potential of the company s technologies 
selling and marketing expense increased from million in to million in as the company continued to focus its efforts on the domestic and international market introduction of integra 
during  the company expanded its network of domestic and international regional managers for the sales of integra 
the company is anticipating a continued increase in selling and marketing costs associated with integra  including costs associated with introduction of integra into additional markets and for additional indications 
general and administrative expense was million in and included two non cash charges in the fourth quarter 
the company incurred a million asset impairment charge associated with certain leasehold improvements at its leased west chester  pennsylvania  and a million charge related to an equity based signing bonus for the company s new president and chief executive officer 
excluding these charges  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in significant increases include the addition of several senior executives and costs related to the continued maintenance of the company s intellectual property and patent infringement litigation 
the company is involved in two patent infringement litigation cases that are in their early stages  and the company anticipates incurring continued significant expenditures during related to these matters 
other income  net  which primarily includes interest income  was million in and as the decline in interest income from lower investment balances was offset by income from other items 
compared to the company s net loss decreased from million in to million in as a result of the required use of purchase accounting  the company s loss included approximately million of acquired in process research and development that was charged to expense at the date of the company s acquisition of telios 
total revenues increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of an increase in product sales 
product sales increased from million to million due to million in sales of integra in compared to minimal sales in the prior year 
approximately of integra sales in were in the united states following its marketing approval from the fda in march  and included sales to burn centers and hospitals throughout the united states and canada 
integra export sales were to countries in europe and asia 
product sales of the company s other medical devices decreased from million in to million in decreases in the company s ophthalmic and surgical and hemostasis product lines were partially offset by increases in its infection control and dental product lines 
the ophthalmic product line decrease was due to production difficulties  which delayed product shipments during the second half of the decrease in the surgical and hemostasis product line  which includes products sold to marketing partners and products marketed directly  was due to lower unit volumes as well as lower unit pricing on the products marketed directly 
the infection control and dental product line increases were the result of increases in orders from marketing partners for the company s biopatch and biomend products 
approximately and of the company s product sales were to three customers in and four customers in  respectively 
the company s export sales including integra increased from  to million as integra export sales increased by  other revenue  which includes grant revenue  license fees  contract development revenue and royalties  was million in and grant revenue in both periods was approximately million  the largest portion of which came from a three year million nist grant 
the nist grant was completed as of december  the company received a  license fee in as part of an agreement with cambridge antibody technology limited involving a human antibody development program 
the company also received a  license fee in from the calcitek division of sulzermedica when the company s biomend product receieved fda marketing clearance 
the company continues to seek research grants  licensing arrangements and development funding for several of its technologies  although the timing and amount of such revenue  if any  can not be predicted 
cost of product sales increased from million of product sales in to million of product sales in the dollar increase in cost of product sales is due to higher product sales and an increase in manufacturing capacity associated with integra and with the company s west chester  pennsylvania facility 
the integra production facility and additional capacity at the west chester facility came on line during the last quarter of cost of product sales as a percentage of sales increased due to inventory write offs related to certain medical product production difficulties and lower capacity utilization for integra product during research and development expense increased from million in to million in  due to an increase of million in research and development expenses incurred by the company s telios operation  which was acquired in august research and development expenditures at telios include costs associated with efforts focusing on combining the company s existing technologies with those acquired in the acquisition 
the company s research and development efforts involving integra decreased significantly from to as a result of the transfer of the product to manufacturing 
additional increases in other research and development projects partially offset the decrease related to the integra transfer 
these increases included costs associated with the addition of full time and part time research and development staff and increased expenditures for outside contract activities 
selling and marketing expense increased from million in to million in as a result of the domestic and international market introduction of integra 
the company was required by the fda to train all surgeons prior to their use of integra  and as of december  the company had trained approximately surgeons worldwide 
during  the company also established a network of domestic and international regional managers for the sales of integra 
integra training and selling cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs resulting from a reduction in the size of the company s direct sales force for certain other medical product lines 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in largely due to increases in costs involving the maintenance of intellectual property and expenditures related to patent infringement litigation 
other income  net  which primarily includes interest income and interest expense  increased from  in to million in largely due to million in interest earned in on the net proceeds of the company s underwritten public offering 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through private and public offerings of its securities  revenues from sales of existing products  research grants from government agencies  development agreements with major industrial companies  borrowings under a revolving credit line and cash acquired in connection with the telios acquisition 
on february   the company completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of its common stock  which resulted in approximately million in net proceeds to the company 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million representing an million decrease from december  the principal uses of funds during were million for operations and  in purchases of property and equipment 
under the company s stock repurchase program see item market price for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  the company may utilize from time to time its available cash to repurchase the company s common stock on the open market 
the amount and timing of any share repurchases will depend on market conditions as well as the company s cash position 
in march  the company entered into a series of agreements under which it will issue  shares of preferred stock for million during the second quarter of the newly issued series of preferred stock will carry an annual dividend of  and each preferred share will be convertible into one share of the company s common stock 
the company anticipates it will continue to use its liquid assets to fund operations until sufficient revenues can be generated through product sales and collaborative arrangements 
in addition  the company may continue to raise additional funding through the use of private or public offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient revenues to obtain profitability or raise additional funding in equity transactions 
factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that the following important factors  among others  have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s results of operations and could cause the company s future results to differ materially from its historical results and those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
o the company believes that its integra product represents a relatively new method of treatment  and as such  it is difficult to estimate the potential market and potential revenue growth for the product 
the company also believes that integra provides a substantial enhancement over existing treatment alternatives for its current indication  which is the treatment of severe burns 
the company believes that integra provides longer term financial savings and other health benefits by reducing the number of required procedures and the length of the patient s hospital stay 
however  the cost of the product does require the healthcare provider to incur a higher initial cost than is customary under traditional treatment options 
in addition  the health care industry in general is under continued cost containment pressures from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
should the company be unable to demonstrate these savings to the healthcare provider market and others  the company may experience lower than anticipated revenue growth and a resulting adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
o because a significant portion of the company s historical medical product sales have been to a small number of marketing partners  the loss of one of these customers could have a negative impact on revenues 
the company also depends on third party distributors for several products domestically and internationally 
the company s revenues and gross profit margins for these products are dependent on the continuing efforts of these marketing partners and third party distributors 
the company believes that its current relationships with customers regarding these products is satisfactory 
o there can be no assurance that the company s planned research and development efforts will lead to commercially successful products 
many of the company s technologies are in the early stages of development and will require the commitment of substantial additional resources by the company and its potential strategic partners prior to commercialization 
their can be no assurance that any such potential products will be successfully developed on a timely basis  if at all  be safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards and receive necessary regulatory approvals  be produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully marketed and achieve customer acceptance 
there can also be no assurance that the company s current plans for clinical trials to expand the indication of use for integra will result in an expanded indication or achieve a greater market acceptance 
costs due to regulatory delays or demands  unexpected adverse side effects or insufficient therapeutic effectiveness would prevent or significantly slow development and commercialization efforts and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
o the company depends substantially on its ability to obtain patents by license or otherwise  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain  involves many complex legal  factual and technical issues and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to the company s products and technologies will result in patents being issued  that patents issued or licensed by the company will provide protection against competitors or that the company will enjoy patent protection for any significant period of time 
the company is currently involved in two patent infringement lawsuits 
these litigation suits  as well as any possible future litigation  can be lengthy and expensive  and there can be no assurance as to the timing  cost or eventual outcome of such litigation 
the company s business may be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in protecting its patents and proprietary rights 
in addition  the company is the defendant in several lawsuits claiming damages that  if decided against the company  could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
the company believes these lawsuits are without merit and will continue its defense against these suits 
o the markets for the company s actual and proposed products and their intended use are characterized by rapidly changing technology 
competition in the general area of medical technology is intense and is expected to increase 
there are many companies in the medical field that have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than the company 
there is a risk that technological developments will render actual and proposed products or technologies of the company non competitive  uneconomical or obsolete 
as a result  the company s growth and future financial performance depend in part upon its ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products to meet the latest technological advances 
failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and market factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
o the company has developed by acquiring or securing a number of synergistic companies and technologies 
there are certain risks associated with business and technology acquisitions  including incorrectly assessing the value of assets and future prospects  the extent of possible liabilities and the anticipated costs of incorporating acquired businesses into the company 
although the company is frequently in discussions with others relating to the possible technology acquisitions and related matters  it does not currently have any agreement or understanding with respect to any acquisitions or any material technology transfers 
because these types of transactions involve risks and could involve the issuance of the company s equity  any business or technology acquisition could have a material affect on the company s business 
the above factors are not meant to represent an exhaustive list of the risks and uncertainties associated with the company s business 
these factors as well as other factors may affect the company s future results and the company s stock price  particularly on a quarterly basis 
finally  because the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  its stock price is often subject to significant volatility 
other matters at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income  if any  which expire through and  respectively 
at december   several of the company s subsidiaries had unused net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to the company s ownership 
the net operating loss carryforwards excluding telios of approximately million for federal income tax purposes expire between and the company s telios subsidiary has generated approximately million of net operating losses  which expire between and the amount of telios net operating loss that is available and the company s ability to utilize such loss is dependent on the determined value of telios at the date of acquisition 
the company s has valuation allowance of million against all deferred tax assets  including the net operating losses  due to the uncertainty of realization 
the timing and manner in which these net operating losses may be utilized in any year by the company are severely limited by the internal revenue code of  as amended  section and other provisions of the internal revenue code and its applicable regulations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income  which established standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in the financial statements 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was also issued in june  and replaces existing segment disclosure requirements and requires certain financial information regarding operating segments on the basis used internally by management to evaluate segment performance 
these statements will affect disclosure and presentation in the financial statements but will have no impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  cash flows or results of operations 
the company will adopt sfas and in the first quarter of and year end  respectively 
the company believes that its financial and operational systems  with limited modifications  will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company estimates that the costs associated with the year issue will be insignificant and as such will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or operating results
