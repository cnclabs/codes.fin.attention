environmental matters the company has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future closure and post closure obligations with respect to the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the company bases accruals for these commitments on periodic management reviews  typically performed at least annually  based on input from its engineers and accountants and interpretations of current regulatory requirements and proposed regulatory changes 
the accrual for closure and post closure costs includes final capping and cover for the site  methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring  and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after each site discontinues accepting waste 
the company does not discount its accruals for closure and post closure obligations

the difference between the closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total estimated final closure and post closure to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site stops accepting waste and is closed 
as of december   the company also expects to incur approximately  related to future capping activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites  which are also being expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of these environmental matters will not have a material  adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
however  the company s operation of landfills subjects it to certain operational  monitoring  site maintenance  closure and post closure obligations that could give rise to increased costs for monitoring and corrective measures 
the company cannot predict the effect of any regulations or legislation enacted in the future on the company s operations 
seasonality and inflation the company s operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months 
this is generally reflected in the company s first quarter and fourth quarter operating results 
this is primarily attributable to the fact that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future 
year date conversion in  the company began to modify its computer information systems to ensure proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond and expects to complete the required modifications during the amount charged to expense in  as well as the amounts anticipated to be charged to expense in related to the year computer compliance modifications  have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
