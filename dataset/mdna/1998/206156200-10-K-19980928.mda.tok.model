impact of year the year issue is the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date ending in as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on an assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software and hardware so that its systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and hardware  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in timely fashion  the year problems could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company is continuing to contact all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information is approximately  however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company is actively engaged in utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test its software and hardware for year compliance 
the company s objective is to complete the year project not later than july   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the fiscal cost of the year project is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date which the company has established to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
