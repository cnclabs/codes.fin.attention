liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  financing revenue equipment through cash flow from operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
cash and cash equivalents and municipal notes increased to million as of december  from million at december  the company s policy is to purchase only high quality liquid investments 
net cash provided by operations was million in  million in  and million in the primary source of funds in was net income of million increased by non cash adjustments including depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash used in investment and financing activities was million in  million in  and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire a m express  purchase municipal bonds  purchase revenue equipment  and to pay off long term debt 
the company expects to finance future growth in its company owned fleet primarily through cash flow from operations and cash equivalents currently on hand 
trade receivables increased to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to a increase in fourth quarter operating revenue and the acquisition of a m express 
cash paid for income taxes increased to million in from million in higher income taxes on a cash basis are primarily due to increased income and non deductible insurance accruals 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  due mostly to a decrease in payables due to revenue equipment suppliers 
insurance accruals increased to million as of december  from million as of december  due to the significant increase of the company s fleet in recent years 
the company s insurance program for liability  physical damage and cargo damage involves self insurance retentions for the first  claims in excess of the risk retention are covered by insurance in amounts which management considers adequate 
the company accrues the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of the pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical claim development trends 
if adjustments to previously established accruals are required  such amounts are included in operating expenses 
in  and  such adjustments were not significant 
the company has one customer who accounted for more than of the company s sales for the year ended december  as disclosed in footnote three to the financial statements  historically a small number of customers generate a substantial percentage of revenue 
in the company s largest customer generated approximately of operating revenue 
the loss of a major customer could negatively impact the company 
any negative impact would be mitigated by two factors the strong overall financial position of the company no long term debt at december  and million in cash  cash equivalents and municipal notes and the flexibility inherent in having a substantial percentage of fleet miles being generated by independent contractors who provide their own tractors 
based on the company s strong financial position current ratio of and no debt  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary  to continue with growth plans 
forward looking statements inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could have an adverse effect on profitability 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality the nature of the company s primary traffic appliances  automotive parts  paper products  electrical equipment  and packaged foodstuffs causes it to be distributed with relative uniformity throughout the year 
however  earnings have historically been affected adversely during the fourth quarter as a result of reduced shipments by customers during the winter holiday season 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher during the winter months due to increased operating costs in colder weather and higher fuel consumption due to increased engine idling 
year the company has assessed the key financial  informational and operational systems 
management does not anticipate that the company will encounter significant operational issues related to the year furthermore  the financial impact of making required systems changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
