overview drypers is a leading manufacturer and marketer of premium quality  value priced disposable baby diapers and training pants sold under the drypers brand name in the united states and under the drypers and other brand names internationally 
the company also manufactures and sells lower priced diapers under other brand names in the united states and internationally  as well as private label diapers and training pants and pre moistened baby wipes 
during  the company successfully integrated its four regional brands under the drypers brand name which it believes has increased the awareness of the company s products with retailers and consumers while generating operating efficiencies 
the company currently sells its products principally to approximately us grocery retailers with an estimated  retail outlets 
the company continually seeks to expand its us grocery store distribution network while increasing its limited penetration of the mass merchant and drugstore chain markets 
in  sales of branded products represented of the company s net sales in the united states and sales of private label and other products represented of net sales in the united states 
the company s annual net sales increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this sales growth has been achieved by i the expansion of international sales through exports  contract manufacturing and acquisitions of diaper manufacturing operations  particularly in latin america  ii the increased share in existing retail accounts and expanded penetration into new accounts in part due to the introduction of several new product features such as drypers with natural baking soda  and iii the increase in sales of training pants 
the company seeks to expand both its domestic and international sales and operations 
in june  the company introduced drypers with aloe vera  the first diapers and training pants to contain aloe vera  an herbal extract recognized for its ability to help soothe skin 
the improved diaper also featured a breathable  cloth like outer cover typically only found on premium priced branded diapers 
in addition  the company entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with the children s television workshop under which the company s products  packaging  advertising and promotional materials feature big bird  elmo and other familiar characters from the children s television show sesame street 
the company s domestic operations include sales in the united states  puerto rico and exports from these manufacturing operations 
the following table sets forth the company s domestic and international net sales for each of the last three years 
year ended december dollars in millions domestic international total net sales among the factors that have a direct bearing on the company s results of operations are price and product changes and promotional activity by competitors  increases in costs of raw materials  timing of technological advances by the company and its competitors  acceptance by consumers of product features and innovations  foreign governmental monetary and policy changes and other factors discussed herein 
gross profit margins vary significantly across the company s product lines  as do the levels of promotional and marketing support 
accordingly  gross profit margins fluctuate with changes in the relative sales mix of the company s various product lines 
since the differences in gross profit margins are generally offset by differences in promotional spending levels  changes in sales mix do not necessarily cause significant fluctuations in operating margins 
unusual industry conditions in a confluence of unusual events adversely impacted the company s financial performance in in december  the mexican peso was devalued and  because drypers did not have a plant in mexico at that time and was instead exporting to mexico from its houston  texas plant  an estimated million in annual sales were lost almost immediately 
the effect of the economic crisis in mexico later adversely impacted the argentine economy as well  reducing the company s ability to maintain sales volumes and margins in its then recently acquired operations in buenos aires 
beginning in the first quarter of  procter gamble and kimberly clark increased their rates of promotional spending on their premium priced brands more aggressively than the company 
in addition  procter gamble repositioned luvs  its national value priced brand  after having already reduced prices substantially within the previous months  with a reduction in the number of diapers per package and a reduction in price per package 
the company responded with a repositioning of its own  lowering the number of diapers per package and the price per package and  as a result  recognized million in unusual expenses in the first quarter of throughout  the industry experienced substantial price increases in pulp  a major component of the total cost to produce diapers and training pants 
beginning in late  pulp prices rose dramatically with quoted market prices rising from per ton in june to per ton in march  per ton in june and per ton in september due to the competitive environment  the increases in pulp prices were not passed on to consumers  thus reducing gross profit margins 
these increases in pulp prices had a material adverse effect on the company in a decline in the quoted market price of pulp began in november with the quoted market price of pulp ranging between and per ton since march these external events happened at a particularly vulnerable point in the company s own development 
as a final step to complete the company s planned transition to one national brand throughout the united states  the company converted  during the first quarter of  its four regional brands drypers  comfees  baby s choice and wee fits into one common package design and brand name  drypers 
this conversion meant that the company s brand awareness was unusually low in roughly three quarters of the united states until consumers became accustomed to the new brand and package 
in response to rising pulp prices  the company accelerated the conversion of its premium diaper products to include a thinner absorbent core that is less reliant on pulp 
the initial version of this ultra thin product met with slow initial consumer acceptance 
the matters discussed above had a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the company s liquidity was adversely affected  which required it to  among other things  obtain various amendments and waivers from the lenders under its existing revolving credit facility and defer payment of the interest due on november  under its million of outstanding senior notes  which default was cured by the payment of overdue interest on february  as part of the refinancing described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
improved recent performance in response to these events  management implemented a plan to improve sales and margins  increase operating efficiency and substantially reduce costs throughout the company s operations 
the major components of the cost reduction program included the closure of the company s houston manufacturing facility  reduction of manufacturing and general overhead costs and a redesigned premium diaper  which reduced overall product cost 
between january and january  the company s redesign of its premium diaper to an ultra thin configuration reduced pulp content as measured by weight by 
in response to initial slow consumer acceptance  this product was subsequently modified resulting in increased consumer acceptance 
the full benefit of the cost reduction plan was not reflected in operating income until the third quarter of  as the company invested heavily in promotional spending to rebuild market share during the first half of in the second half of  promotional spending returned to normal levels 
to offset its loss of export sales to mexico  the company re entered the mexican diaper market in the second quarter of through contract manufacturing arrangements with a local producer 
the company acquired the manufacturing operations of this producer in december in addition  the company introduced drypers with natural baking soda in may as a result of the combined effect of these initiatives  the company experienced a significant recovery of sales volume and a return to profitability 
in  the company experienced improved financial performance  in part due to the successful introduction of drypers with natural baking soda in may of that year and a full year of consolidated operations in argentina 
net sales increased by to million in from million in as a result of the new product launch  the improved competitive pricing environment  the effects of its cost reduction program and lower pulp prices  the company increased its national market share and returned to profitability  generating ebitda of million in as compared with a loss of million in the company continued its improved financial performance in as its net sales and ebitda increased to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  from million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in each of the eight consecutive quarters ended december   the company s ebitda exceeded its ebitda for the same quarter of the prior year 
results of operations the following table sets forth the specified components of income and expense for the company expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   and year ended december net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses unusual expenses restructuring charge operating income loss interest expense  net other income income loss before income tax provision benefit and extraordinary item income tax provision benefit extraordinary item net income loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  domestic sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily the result of the june introduction of drypers with aloe vera and the launch of the licensing arrangement for the sesame street characters  as well as the introduction of the baking soda product in may  and the continued growth in training pant and private label sales 
the company believes that the introduction of the new product innovations contributed to an increased share in existing retail accounts and expanded penetration into new accounts in the united states 
the increase in us sales between periods was mitigated by a decline during the third quarter of in net sales in puerto rico due to price competition from procter gamble and a decline in export sales resulting from pricing pressures in asia due to recent currency declines 
net sales in the international sector grew to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior comparable period 
this substantial increase reflected primarily the improved sales volume for the company s operations in argentina  the growth of business in mexico and the company s majority owned consolidated venture in brazil  which began operations in march cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased slightly as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase reflected growth in international sales which have generally lower gross profit margins and correspondingly lower selling and promotional costs partially offset by lower raw material costs and the benefits of higher volumes over the company s fixed cost base 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease reflected the company s efforts and focus on reducing domestic per pad selling costs  including but not limited to reducing the face value and volume of coupons  in store promotions and slotting fees and improved management and monitoring of  and controls over  promotional allowances

year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  domestic sales increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of increased promotional spending at the beginning of the year  the introduction of the new baking soda product in may  and continued growth in training pant sales 
net sales in the international sector grew significantly to million in from million in most of this increase came from the inclusion of the results of the company s operations in argentina for a full year in as compared to five months during  with the balance generated by the establishment of a contract manufacturing relationship in mexico 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for compared to for the prior year 
a major component of the cost of goods sold is the cost of pulp  which accounted for approximately and of cost of goods sold in and  respectively 
of the percentage point improvement  approximately percentage points resulted from a reduction in the average cost of pulp content in the company s products in with the balance resulting from efficiency improvements 
the quoted market price of pulp began at per ton and fluctuated between per ton and per ton for most of the year as compared to when the quoted market price began the year at per ton but fluctuated between per ton and per ton for most of the year 
the major components of improved efficiency included closure of the houston manufacturing facility and increased sales and production volumes

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended december  compared to of net sales for the total increase reflected higher couponing and promotional spending as well as an increase in the percentage of premium domestic diaper and training pant sales relative to total net sales  offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and by the increases in international sales which have inherently lower selling and promotional costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales declined during  however  from of net sales in the first quarter to of net sales in the fourth quarter  due to the company s focus on reducing per pad selling costs 
the reduction in per pad selling costs was made possible by the increased demand for the company s new baking soda diaper

operating income as a percentage of net sales was in interest expense  net interest expense  net was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility and amortization of additional deferred loan costs related to the refinancing 
income taxes the company recorded a provision related to state and foreign taxes of  for the year ended december  a portion of the company s available us net operating loss carryforwards offset the need for any federal tax provision related to domestic operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements include  but are not limited to  the payment of principal and interest on its debt  the funding of working capital needs  primarily inventory  accounts receivable and advertising and promotional expenses  and the funding of capital investments in machinery  equipment and computer systems

the company s operations used million of cash during the year ended december  and million of cash during the year ended december  in  the company returned its working capital to more normal levels from previous years by reducing accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the use of cash during the year ended december  reflected the cash portion of the extraordinary item and increases in working capital primarily for the growth in the mexico and brazil operations  the latter including advances to the company s contract manufacturer for future inventory purchases 
the company generated cash flows of million from operations in in  as the company experienced the difficulties described above under overview unusual industry conditions in  which resulted in a net loss of million  it was able to maintain positive cash flow primarily by reducing the levels of receivables and inventories it maintained by million  and by allowing its accounts payable and accrued liabilities to rise by an aggregate of million 
the company s capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the significant increase between periods in capital expenditures reflected machine enhancements incurred in connection with the launch of drypers with aloe vera and production capacity increases

the company s estimated cash requirements during  excluding the aforementioned cost increases  are primarily the funding of working capital needs  payment of debt service and planned capital expenditures of approximately million

the company takes careful steps to design  produce and sell its baby diapers to avoid infringing any valid patents of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be held to be infringing on existing patents in the future  any such holding could result in an injunction  damages and or an increase in future operating costs as a result of design changes or payment of royalties with respect to such patents  which might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
this area will become of increasing importance as the company continues to introduce new products and product innovations  thus  the company may incur expenses related to additional license agreements and or additional patent infringement insurance coverage 
the company s working capital was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s current assets increased from million as of december  to million as of december  and to million as of december   and current liabilities  including short term debt  decreased from million in to million in and to million as of december  total debt increased from million as of december  to million as of december  and to million at december  on june   the company closed its private issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes

the revolving credit facility provides for up to million of borrowings  with availability determined as a function of advance rates based on eligible accounts receivable  finished goods inventory and raw material inventory 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of prime plus per annum and mature in february as of march   the company s borrowing base of accounts receivable and inventories would have permitted it to borrow up to million 
no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  the company has received a proposal from bankboston  na for a three year million new credit facility to replace the revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility is expected to permit the company to borrow under a borrowing base formula equal to the sum of of the aggregate net book value of its accounts receivable and of the aggregate net book value of its inventory on a consolidated basis  subject to additional limitations on incurring debt 
the new credit facility is expected to bear interest in the range of prime to prime plus  or libor plus to libor plus  in each case based on the company s debt to ebitda ratio determined on a quarterly basis 
the new credit facility would be secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at december   the company s borrowing base would have permitted the company to borrow up to million if the new credit facility had been in place

the exercise price for the option to acquire newlund is million 
management believes that future cash flow from operations  together with cash on hand  available borrowings under the revolving credit facility or the new credit facility  if entered into and the net proceeds of the new senior notes described above will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements  including working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and limited acquisitions  for the foreseeable future 
inflation inflationary conditions in the united states have been moderate and  except for pulp prices in  have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
despite higher inflationary rates in latin america  inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations of the company s operations located in that region because the company has generally been able to pass on cost increases to its customers 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes standards for reporting of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other nonowner changes in equity 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal reclassification of comparative financial statements provided for earlier periods will be required

for the fiscal year ending december  year the operation of the company s business is dependent in part on its computer software programs and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
these programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including materials purchasing  inventory management  pricing  sales  shipping and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company has been evaluating its programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems 
the year compliance issues exist because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
therefore  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as the year or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause the programs and systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
it is anticipated that replacement of most of the company s programs and systems will be necessary to make such programs and systems year compliant 
the company is also communicating with suppliers  financial institutions and others to coordinate year conversions 
based on present information  the company believes that it will be able to achieve such year compliance through a replacement of existing programs and systems with new programs and systems that are already year compliant 
however  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
the company expects that the expenses and capital expenditures associated with the replacement of the company s programs and systems will be approximately million over the next two years
