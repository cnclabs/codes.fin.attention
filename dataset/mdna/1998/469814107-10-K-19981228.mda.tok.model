for fiscal years through  substantially all such revenues related to the company s offices in the uk and ireland

hgc india has operations in india and executes projects for commercial clients in the chemical  pharmaceuticals and petroleum markets 
revenues earned in fiscal and from the company s offices in mexico and chile were not material 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts undertaken by the company  they can generally be grouped into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five years ended september  cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of the company s contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
when the company is directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a process plant  the company reflects the cost of materials  equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for the years ended september     and in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company plus a predetermined fee  or a fee based on a percentage of the costs incurred 
the company prefers this type of contract since it believes that the primary basis for its selection should be its technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price considerations 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  the company is first selected as the contractor  and then the contract price is negotiated 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where the company has the opportunity to perform engineering and design work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  the company must bid against other contractors based upon specifications furnished by the client 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications  problems with new technologies page and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period  that are reduced by the negotiation process 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to the company 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then the company will bear all or a portion of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  the company will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
competition the company is engaged in a highly competitive business 
some of its competitors are larger than the company  or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and may possess greater resources than the company 
furthermore  because the engineering aspect of the business does not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  the company competes with both national and international firms in sizes ranging from very large to a wide variety of small  regional and specialty firms 
the extent of the company s competition varies according to the industries and markets it serves  as well as the geographical areas in which the company operates 
the company s largest competitors for engineering  construction and maintenance services for process plants include such well known companies as bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  raytheon engineers  mw kellogg  parsons co  kellogg brown root  and kvaerner 
in the semiconductor industry  the company s principal competitors include industrial design corporation 
in the area of pulp and paper  the company s principal competitors include be k  kellogg brown root  and raytheon engineers 
and in the area of environmental engineering and hazardous waste cleanup  the company s principal competitors include many of the companies listed above  as well as morrison knudsen corporation  and other specialized companies such as it group  inc  icf kaiser and roy f

page item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  the company is subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves the company as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury and other similar lawsuits 
in addition  as a contractor for many agencies of the united states government  the company is subject to many levels of audits  investigations and claims by  or on behalf of  the government with respect to its contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations and procurement practices 
management believes  after consultation with counsel  that such guarantees  litigation  and united states government contract related audits  investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the us attorney for the central district of california announced that it was intervening in a lawsuit filed against the company by a former employee under the false claims act 
the lawsuit alleges that the company overbilled the us government for lease costs paid by the company and relating to its former headquarters building located in pasadena  california 
the building had once been owned by the company  but was sold by it in calendar  at which time the company entered into a year lease of the property 
the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages against the company  which may be trebled under certain provisions of the act 
additional remedies available to the government include possible administrative or civil liabilities  and the imposition of civil penalties for each violation 
the company has denied any wrongdoing in the method it accounted for the lease costs in question 
the company contends it has billed the government for only those costs it actually incurred  and believes its accounting treatment of the lease costs complied with all applicable regulations 
furthermore  the sale and lease back transaction that is the subject of the lawsuit occurred nearly years prior to the initiation by the department of justice of its investigation 
the transaction had been fully disclosed in numerous public filings made by the company since the date of the transaction  and the company s final indirect cost rate proposals  which the company had filed regularly and routinely with the defense contract audit agency dcaa and which included the lease costs  had been audited by the dcaa for many years without the dcaa taking exception to the company s accounting treatment of the lease costs 
although the final outcome of this matter cannot be determined at the present time  the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit
