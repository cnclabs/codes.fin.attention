the year to year increase in total trading income in and  when compared to the respective prior year  reflected  in part  the increased contribution of the emerging markets trading unit and other revenue increases generated from trading securities and derivative related products 
in  trading revenue generated in the moscow subsidiary on russian government securities also contributed to the increase over precious metals income from precious metals is derived from the corporation s activities as a dealer in gold and silver bullion and coins sold to commercial and industrial users and investors  as well as its trading and arbitrage activities in the precious metals markets 
income from precious metals was million in  as compared to million in and million in the change in both and from the respective prior year reflected lower trading revenue  which in each case  was offset by higher levels of net interest income from trading and funding these activities

also included in expenses was a one time charge of million from an arbitration judgment and related legal costs 
the arbitration related to a dispute in with a former customer of rnysc involving currency futures trades 
the corporation disagrees with the decision of the arbitration panel and has filed an appeal 
the increase in total other operating expenses before restructuring and related charges in reflected approximately million of expenses in an expanded branch network attributable to the acquisition of bbi and other branches purchased from bank leumi  first nationwide bank fsb and independence savings bank during the year 
during  the corporation invested in the initiatives described above that were designed to increase revenues in future periods and in infrastructure to support and control those operations 
retail banking expenses increased as a result of the branch expansion mentioned above 
growth in the volumes of mortgage and home equity loans as well as increased sales of investment products resulted in the payment of additional fees for related services 
the corporation continued to invest in broadening the array of its investment product offerings  including the recent introduction of an asset allocation product which is targeted at retail clients 
rfsc saw significant expansion during the year to include offering full service and discount securities brokerage services to corporate and retail clients 
the corporation also invested in trading market services and in advanced risk management systems to support its expanding trading operations 
the development of a new profitability measuring system which will enable the corporation to efficiently measure and present line of business results also contributed to the higher expense level 
in the second quarter of  the corporation recorded a million pre tax provision for restructuring and related charges as a result of the implementation of project excellence plus 
for additional information on this charge see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report 
in addition  in  the corporation converted the financial reporting of its operations in chile and uruguay and rbcc to a current basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
the conversion resulted in a one time increase to expense of million for the year 
salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits were million in  million in and million in the increase in salaries and benefits in over the prior year reflects the opening of new foreign offices and higher levels of staff and increased provisions for incentive compensation 
the increase in salaries and benefits in over the prior year reflects staff additions attributable to the acquisitions mentioned above  recently established operations and to the achievement of higher revenue thresholds that required higher provisions for incentive compensation reflecting more competitive market conditions 
occupancy occupancy costs were million in  million in and million in the decline in from  resulted primarily from a lower level of real estate taxes due to certain real estate tax rebates

other expenses all other expenses were million in  million in and million in all other expenses in includes the one time costs of million associated with the arbitration judgment mentioned above and million of year expenses discussed below 
communication and equipment expenses represent a substantial portion of other expenses which amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in  million in and million in the increase in this expense is primarily due to the acquisition of bbi and other branches that occurred during the year 
also  professional fees  consisting of consulting  external legal and audit fees  amounted to million in compared to million in and million in all other expenses include premiums for deposit insurance paid to the fdic of million in  compared to million in and million in the decline in this expense in from  was the result of a reduction of the premium rate paid for fdic insurance 
other expenses in also included the effect of adopting a change in the method of accounting for charitable contributions that resulted in a one time charge of million 
year project the corporation  like most commercial and financial institutions  is working to assure that its operating and processing systems will continue to function when the year arrives 
the corporation has developed and implemented a comprehensive plan designed to complete substantially all system conversions by the end of a significant part of that plan involves contracts the corporation has entered into with vendors to provide facilities and manpower to carry out required conversions and follow up testing 
operating expenses in included million of these project costs 
based on this plan  it is estimated that total incremental expenses for the year project will be approximately million 
the remaining cost of approximately million will be incurred over the quarters ending december  the exact timing and amount of such expenses depends on the progress of converting and testing individual systems and applications  based on its plan  the corporation expects that quarterly expense levels related to the year project will increase from the current levels to a peak in early and then decline significantly through european monetary union the corporation is engaged in various efforts worldwide to prepare for the planned introduction in january  of the single currency known as the euro 
the participating member states will be determined by the european commission in may commencing january   the currencies of the participating member states will convert at rates of exchange to be determined into the euro over a three year transition period  the ecu will be converted into the euro at a rate of one for one 
the corporation has developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to prepare for the introduction of the euro and its impact on the corporation s products  lines of business and systems 
all major functions and product areas of the corporation have developed action plans to deal effectively with the implications of the introduction of the euro 
vendors of systems used by the corporation have been contacted to obtain information regarding their preparedness for the introduction of the euro 
total incremental expenses for the euro conversion are currently estimated to be approximately million  most of which will be incurred during total applicable income taxes total applicable income taxes  which includes the effect of a taxable equivalent adjustment  increased million in to million  after increasing million in over the ratio of total applicable income taxes to income before taxes has remained at approximately in each of the last three years 
the increase in total applicable income taxes in and  when compared to the respective prior year  reflected the higher levels of taxable income for the year 
included in income taxes in was a tax benefit of approximately million related to non taxable income from discontinued operations of domestic subsidiaries 
income taxes in were reduced by a one time million tax benefit recognized as a result of a tax law change enacted in the income tax benefit was recognized by the corporation because it was no longer liable for deferred taxes which had been provided in prior years for credit provisions 
net income applicable to common stock diluted net income applicable to common stock diluted was a record million in  compared to million in and million in diluted earnings per common share were in  in and in dividends declared and the average annual rates paid on the corporation s issues of preferred stock were as follows million in at  million in at and million in at 
liability and asset management changes in the level of interest rates and the relationship between rates can affect net interest income 
the structure of the corporation s liabilities determines the structure of its assets both on and off balance sheet  so that the maturity and interest rate sensitivities are generally matched 
this practice has two important implications 
first  liquidity requirements can be met more readily because a large proportion of assets mature when liabilities mature 
second  the impact of changes in the levels of interest rates on the corporation is reduced because assets and liabilities have approximately the same interest rate sensitivity 
diversification is another principle employed in the management of liabilities and assets 
the corporation is active in international banking and  in managing this activity  diversifies risks among many countries and counterparties throughout the world 
liabilities  which are mostly interest bearing deposits and other purchased funds  are obtained from both domestic and international sources 
these sources of funds represent a wide range of depositors  mostly individuals  and various types of deposits 
the corporation also raises funds from institutional and individual investors with a variety of marketable instruments 
the diversification of the corporation s funding sources enhances the stability of the funding base 
from time to time  the corporation s management may decide to mismatch on and off balance sheet liabilities and assets in a strategic gap position as a means of managing net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity gaps occur when interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets differ in repricing dates and anticipated maturities 
such decisions reflect management s views on the direction of interest rates and general market conditions 
the gap position is established with marketable securities of high credit quality in liquid markets and is carefully monitored by management 
the corporation uses off balance sheet interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps  caps  options and forwards as hedges or to modify the interest rate characteristics of specific assets or liabilities  collectively referred to as a hedge 
the corporation manages its exposure to interest rate sensitivity resulting from its gap position with hedges and records these hedges in a manner consistent with the accounting treatment for the underlying asset or liability 
the corporation monitors the near term interest rate sensitivity of its liability and asset positions by quantifying the earnings at risk to simulated changes in interest rates 
a net interest income simulation model measures this sensitivity 
this model utilizes monte carlo simulation  a statistical technique that allows the corporation to build variability around current market conditions 
inputs include the maturity and repricing characteristics of the corporation s on and off balance sheet liability and asset positions as well as assumptions on interest rates  asset prepayments  inter bank spreads and deposit growth 
given the assumptions used  the model s output projects the variance in net interest income over the next year 
the board of directors adopted a limit of of annual net interest income at risk  based on this measured interest rate sensitivity 
results are periodically presented to the asset and liability management committee and to the board of directors 
simulation modeling gives a broader view of net interest income variability than does traditional gap analysis  allowing the corporation to capture more variables that are interest rate sensitive and to explore interrelationships between variables 
to complement the simulation model  the corporation employs traditional gap analysis to provide information on longer term interest rate sensitivity 
the table below illustrates the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position at december  and the interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and liabilities  is presented by repricing period  based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
factors considered are the contractual terms of the underlying obligations  including off balance sheet items such as interest rate swaps and caps  as well as management s estimates of prepayment patterns of mortgage backed securities and interest sensitivity of core deposits 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
in addition  significant variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing periods presented in which the corporation has interest rate positions 
repricing period at december  after one after three after seven within year but within years but within years but within after one year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitivity gap   asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap   repricing period at december  after one after three after seven within year but within years but within years but within after one year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitivity gap    asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    in the second quarter of  the corporation began  with the use of hedges  to reduce the interest rate gap that was allowed to widen in the hedges had maturities between one and seven years

in determining the creditworthiness of international borrowers  the economic  political and social conditions that affect the borrower s ability to repay obligations must be taken into account 
through country and political analysis and diversification of activities across a wide geographic distribution and within exposure limits set on a country by country basis  the corporation reduces the unique risks of extending international credit 
the corporation endeavors to reflect risk in its pricing policy

the following table is an analysis  at december   of loans due after one year which have fixed interest rates and those with interest rates that vary directly in relation to the corporation s reference rate  an international money market rate or some other similar variable base rate 
loans with variable rates amounting to approximately million are due after one year 
fixed rate variable rate total in thousands loans due after one year domestic loans    foreign loans    aggregate allowance for possible credit losses the corporation s policy is to maintain an aggregate allowance for possible credit losses that is adequate to absorb any inherent credit losses 
inherent losses are unconfirmed losses that probably exist  based upon known information regarding the credit quality and portfolio characteristics prevailing as of the date of the evaluation 
if future events confirm these losses  these amounts will be charged off against the allowance for possible credit losses 
in the second quarter of  the corporation changed its method of reporting the aggregate allowance for possible credit losses to be consistent with industry practice 
the aggregate allowance for possible credit losses at december   amounted to million and was apportioned and reported as follows million applicable to trading account assets which is a reduction of trading account assets  million included in other liabilities for off balance sheet extensions of credit  such as standby letters of credit  guarantees and commitments  and million allowance for possible credit losses  which is available to absorb all other possible credit losses 
in accordance with regulatory guidance  the corporation performs a comprehensive and consistently applied analysis of the various factors that affect collectibility  which also includes its trading account assets and other off balance sheet extensions of credit 
the process is complex and includes several different analyses of credit exposures 
management analyzes its loan portfolio by three main components individually significant loans  homogeneous groups or pools of loans and other segmentations of the portfolio into pools of loans with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  type of loan  industry group  collateral  size and maturity and country risk characteristics 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio  particularly non accrual and restructured loans 
the review may result in a determination that a loan should be placed on a non accrual status for income recognition 
in addition  to the extent that management identifies potential losses in the loan portfolio  it reduces the book value of such loans  through charge offs  to their estimated collectible value 
the corporation s policy is to classify as non accrual any loan other than factored trade accounts receivable  consumer installment and residential mortgage loans on which payment of principal or interest is days past due 
in addition  a loan will be classified as non accrual if  in the opinion of management  based upon a review of the borrower s or guarantor s financial condition  collateral value and other factors  payment is questionable  even though payments are not days past due 
when a loan  other than a well secured residential mortgage loan  is classified as non accrual  any unpaid interest is reversed against current income except where the loan is well collateralized and it is anticipated that all unpaid interest will be collected 
the loan remains in a non accrual classification until such time as the loan is brought current  when it may be returned to accrual classification 
when principal and interest on a non accrual loan are brought current  if in management s opinion future payments are questionable  the loan would remain classified as non accrual 
subsequent payments of either interest or principal received on a partially charged off non accrual or restructured loan are first applied to any remaining balance outstanding  until the loan is reduced to its net realizable value  then to recoveries and finally to income 
interest is included in income thereafter only to the extent received in cash 
factored trade accounts receivable that are past due days or more remain on a non accrual basis except when past due interest will be charged to and collected from the factoring client 
the large number of consumer installment loans and the relatively small dollar amount of each makes an individual review impracticable 
the corporation charges off any consumer installment loan which is past due days 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status when the mortgagor is in bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings are instituted  at which time the loan ceases to accrue interest 
any accrued interest receivable remains in interest income as an obligation of the borrower 
the individually significant loans represent larger  more problematic loans which are individually assessed as to collectibility 
for homogeneous portfolios  principally the consumer retail portfolio  the corporation utilizes the prior year s loss experience to estimate an amount necessary to provide for the upcoming twelve months of expected losses 
for the other segments of the portfolio  historical loss rates are calculated for loans with similar characteristics 
these loss rates are updated quarterly and are based upon the loss experience incurred for more than the last five years 
while historical loss rates provide a starting point for the corporation s analysis  historical losses are not by themselves a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for possible credit losses 
the actual rate selected for the analysis may differ from the calculated loss rate as the historical rate may be adjusted upward or downward to reflect current and anticipated business and economic conditions and other factors which are likely to cause the current portfolio to differ from historical experience 
the corporation s allowance also reflects a margin for the imprecision in the estimates of expected credit losses 
the resultant allowance for possible credit losses is viewed by management as a single  unallocated allowance available for all credit losses and any segmentation thereof is done only for compliance with reporting requirements 
the following table presents data related to the aggregate allowance for possible credit losses and net charge offs for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year      charge offs domestic commercial and industrial      installment loans to individuals      secured by real estate      foreign      total charge offs      recoveries domestic commercial and industrial      installment loans to individuals  secured by real estate      foreign      total recoveries      net charge offs      provision charged to operating expense      allowance of acquired companies  translation adjustment   balance at end of year      includes losses of million in  on the sale  swap and charge off of restructuring countries debt 
primarily restructuring countries debt in the aggregate provision for credit losses was million in  all of which was applied to the allowance for possible credit losses  a decline of million from  as the level of non performing loans and net charge offs each declined in when compared to the provision for credit losses increased to million in from million in the increase in the provision in resulted from management s decision to increase the provision for credit losses in the third quarter of by million to be prudent in the context of increased domestic and international exposures 
the provision for credit losses declined slightly to million in from million in the economic improvement in domestic and foreign markets  which was noted in  continued into however  in  a weakening in the domestic chain store sector contributed to higher levels of domestic charge offs that were partially offset by recoveries from foreign debtors in foreign restructuring countries 
the provision for credit losses declined to million in  compared to million in as economic improvement in domestic and foreign markets contributed to an enhancement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio and a declining level of non performing loans and net charge offs

the following table presents information related to the corporation s non accrual loans and other non performing assets at december  in each of the last five years 
in thousands non accrual loans domestic      foreign      total non accrual loans      other assets and real estate owned      total non accrual loans and other non performing assets      includes million of restructuring countries in includes non performing assets at december  and  with a carrying value of million and million  respectively  acquired in the bbi transaction that are covered by a loss sharing agreement with the fdic which expires on june  the covered amounts of such non performing assets at december  and were million million  respectively

also excluded from the above table are loans past due days and still on accrual status  primarily residential mortgage loans  which amounted to million  million  million  million and million at year ends    and  respectively 
the increase in past due and accruing residential mortgage loans in from prior years were due to those acquired from bbi 
at december  in each of the years through  the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses represented approximately    and  respectively  of total non accrual and restructured loans 
the decline in the coverage from to is primarily associated with non performing loans acquired from bbi in substantially all of the increase in non performing loans acquired from bbi is covered by an fdic loss sharing agreement 
the coverage of the allowance for possible credit losses to non accrual and restructured loans is only one subjective measure of the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses that management utilizes 
non accrual domestic loans declined million to million at year end after increasing to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the non accrual loans acquired in the bbi transaction substantially all of which are covered by an fdic loss sharing agreement 
the change in non accrual loans between and the prior year was primarily the result of increased non accrual loans in the chain store sector and reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio that were charged off or transferred to the other real estate owned classification 
in order to comply with certain regulatory reporting requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
in addition  by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation

the corporation seeks to control these risks by diversifying its exposures and activities among many instruments  markets  clients and geographic regions and by limiting its positions in various instruments and investments 
the processes and procedures by which the corporation manages its risk profile continually evolve as the corporation s business activities change in response to market and product developments 
the corporation routinely reviews its procedures in order to ensure that they are comprehensive with respect to all major risks and that a consistent approach is followed throughout the organization 
to enhance the environment for the corporation s risk management activities and assist in decision making  significant investments have been made in the training of personnel and in the development of information technology 
proprietary and analytical trading systems have been developed for the corporation s existing and future business 
this control environment is subject to periodic review by management  internal auditors and regulators 
the global risk assessment committee of the corporation s board of directors oversees the identification  measurement and limitation of the risks relating to all activities of  and products offered by  the corporation 
this committee s activities include review of risk management methodologies employed by management 
the committee is supported by the global risk assessment group the gra  whose task is to develop and implement risk quantification and reporting mechanisms 
this group also monitors market related risk exposure on a daily basis  reporting to management 
credit risk credit risk for lending  trading and investment activities and products represents the possibility of loss to the corporation if a borrower or counterparty fails to honor their commitment to repay contractual obligations 
credit risk and exposure to loss are inherent parts of the banking business 
management seeks to manage and control or limit these risks through its loan and investment policies  including obtaining collateral  and credit review procedures 
senior management establishes and continually reviews lending and investment criteria and approval procedures that reflect the risk averse policy of the corporation 
the credit review committee of the board of directors periodically reviews and approves the corporation s policies and procedures to define  measure and monitor the credit and settlement risks arising from the corporation s diverse activities 
global limits are established to control these risks  and it is the responsibility of each operating unit to conduct its business activity within these prescribed limits 
any customer credit  currency or transaction exposure that exceeds established limits must be approved by senior management 
management s objective in establishing lending and investment standards is to minimize the risk of loss 
in the case of foreign investments and loans  management emphasizes investments and loans to  or with guarantees of  governments  government agencies or banks 
in addition  the corporation places particular emphasis on the matching of the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
by this policy  the corporation seeks to minimize the effect of rate changes  largely externally influenced and difficult to control  on the portfolio and to limit its exposure primarily to credit risks over which it has more direct control 
one technique which the corporation utilizes to achieve these goals is to enter into interest rate contracts  including swaps  caps and collars and currency swaps  each of which is designed to protect against interest rate or currency fluctuations 
see liability and asset management  for additional information on interest rate management 
the credit review department provides an independent evaluation of the corporation s credit exposures and assures ongoing credit quality by reviewing individual credits and concentrations  with a focus on operating units where risk is at a higher level  and monitoring of corrective action where necessary 
additionally  the credit review department evaluates adherence to laws and regulations and to policies and established criteria as stated in the corporation s credit policy manual to assure compliance with such standards 
the credit review department also periodically prepares portfolio summaries for review by executive management and the board of directors 
these reports are then submitted for consideration to certain members of executive management who determine the amount of loans to be charged off 
the executive credit committee subsequently reviews the loans to be charged off and ratifies executive management s decision 
rules and formulae relative to the adequacy of the allowance  although useful as guidelines to management  are not final determinants 
in addition  any loan or portion thereof which is classified as a loss by regulatory examiners is charged off 
consistent with its policy of maintaining an adequate allowance for possible credit losses  management generally charges off a loan  or a portion thereof  when a loss is probable 
market risk market risk is the possibility of a decline in value of the corporation s assets net of hedges acquired in the course of its trading activities and asset liability management 
to manage market risk  the corporation establishes limits for interest rate  foreign currency and other market exposures 
an important tool in monitoring exposures and establishing limits for substantially all products offered is the estimation  under a range of assumptions  of the potential loss of current and future earnings on existing positions within the markets being measured 
the management asset and liability committee provides a forum for reviewing the corporation s liquidity profile and the market risk in its asset and liability positions 
the management asset and liability committee regularly reviews the corporation s market exposures and analyzes the effects of actual or projected changes in rates  prices or market liquidity on the value of these positions 
such committee also reviews the corporation s liquidity profile by monitoring the differences in maturities between assets and liabilities and by analyzing the future level of funds required based on various assumptions  including its ability to liquidate investment and trading positions and its ability to access the markets for funds 
for additional information on asset liability management see note of notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 
on and off balance sheet market risk sensitivity one of the corporation s most significant risks is to us interest rate fluctuations in its investing  lending and borrowing activities 
the extent of this risk will fluctuate when the level and interest sensitivity characteristics of its interest earning assets differs from its interest bearing liabilities 
as part of the process in managing this risk  while at the same time seeking to maximize the level of net interest income generated  the corporation may modify the asset liability mix of its cash instruments or use derivatives to adjust the interest rate characteristics of specific on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
based on the corporation s asset and liability positions  including associated off balance sheet interest rate hedges  primarily swaps and caps  the corporation has simulated the effect of an immediate parallel upward shift in the yield curve at december  and the impact of this shift on the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities and on net interest income 
this simulation included estimating the values of all fixed rate financial instruments with maturities of more than six months and then re pricing them with interest rates adjusted for the upward yield curve shift 
the optionality on instruments such as mortgage backed securities and the mortgage loan portfolio was taken into account by the internal model 
interest bearing liabilities without a stated maturity  primarily savings deposits and demand deposits amounting to approximately billion  were assumed to have no change in value under the simulation 
variable rate assets and liabilities were not considered to be price sensitive and their values were also assumed to have no change under the simulation 
based on the results of this simulation  the corporation estimates that this change in interest rates would reduce the value of net financial assets by approximately million and that net interest income would be reduced by approximately million over the next twelve months 
all of the assumptions above are based upon the corporation s asset and liability mix as of december  the corporation believes that the information presented above provides a quantification of its exposure to interest rate sensitivity as of the date presented under the scenario described 
the corporation continuously monitors its exposure to interest rate sensitivity  and actual changes in interest rates  economic conditions and the credit quality of its portfolio could lead to results that differ from those presented 
trading market risk sensitivity the corporation s value at risk var analysis and reporting is based on the following two principles var applies to all global trading positions across all risk asset classes foreign exchange  interest rate  commodity  equity and optionality  and var is based on the concept of independent valuations  with all transactions being repriced by an independent risk management function using separate models prior to being stressed against the var parameters 
var attempts to capture the potential us dollar loss resulting from unfavorable market developments within a given time horizon typically one day and given a certain confidence level 
deriving a single  global number entails a mathematical modeling of all the securities in the trading portfolio and the correlations between them  consistent with industry practices  such as the assumption of normally distributed returns for linear ie  non option like instruments 
with respect to options  gra currently relies on historical simulations  going back at least one year 
future plans call for a full fledged monte carlo simulation approach  to obtain greater precision 
a daily var profit and loss statement and rolling sixty day var report are broken down by business unit and globally aggregated and distributed daily to management 
if the profit and loss statement on a given day is negative and in excess of var limits  an exception will have taken place 
all exceptions are reported to management upon occurrence and to the occ  quarterly 
in addition to var  gra monitors the specific risks associated with certain securities traded by the corporation 
one element of specific risk is event risk which is defined as an adverse market motion with a probability of less than one percent on any given day  ie  of a nature to generate exceptions 
for example  emerging market credit driven bond spreads  which as the recent upheavals in asia and latin america demonstrated  cannot be modeled by way of normal distributions 
specific risk models are continually back tested  to alert immediately gra as to any shift in their accuracy 
finally  a three  four and five standard deviation stress test with a one day time horizon is performed biweekly on the global trading book maintained by the corporation 
over five hundred stress variables are identified  spanning all relevant markets 
each variable is stressed up and down while leaving the others unchanged 
a partial profit and loss resulting from the worst of the two runs is generated for each variable 
the results are summed across all variables yielding the stressed exposure 
the stressing process illustrates unusually large market movements occurring simultaneously  without the benefit of combining the parameters 
the diversification of the corporation s trading portfolios serves to reduce the impact  if any  of any such unusually large detrimental market movements 
based on var stress projections using a confidence level  the corporation estimates that at december   the potential loss on all of its trading positions consisted of million from foreign exchange positions  million from interest rate positions  million from interest rate and equity derivatives and million from precious metals and foreign exchange options 
the aggregate loss on these positions after considering correlation was approximately million 
operational risk the corporation  like all large financial institutions  is exposed to many types of operational risks  including the potential for loss caused by a breakdown in information  communication  transaction processing and settlement systems and procedures 
the corporation attempts to mitigate operational risk at appropriate levels in view of its financial position  the characteristics of the businesses and markets in which it operates  competitive circumstances and regulatory considerations 
to date  losses from operational risks have not been material to the financial position of the corporation 
capital resources and liquidity capital financing policy the corporation s policy is to obtain capital externally  when opportunities arise  if the cost of such capital is reasonable and the form is appropriate for the corporation s needs and overall capital structure 
in keeping with this policy  capital has been obtained externally on several occasions  although  at such times  the corporation  relative to other major bank holding companies  was considered to be well capitalized 
the corporation conducts its business through its bank and non bank subsidiaries 
thus  the corporation frequently provides capital and financing to these subsidiaries to support their operations and to permit expansion 
in formulating its dividend policy  the corporation s board of directors considers historical financial results  future prospects and anticipated needs for capital 
the current policy  which is reviewed annually  is to pay out approximately to of the prior year s earnings on a normalized basis 
this policy is intended to provide stockholders with increasing dividend income while allowing the corporation to maintain its desired internal capital generation rate 
future dividends are dependent upon the corporation s financial results  capital requirements and economic conditions in general 
capital transactions during  the corporation repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock  of which  shares were repurchased pursuant to programs authorizing the purchase of up to  shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and  shares were repurchased from employees upon the vesting of their ownership rights in accordance with the corporation s restricted stock plans 
on december   a shelf registration statement became effective pursuant to which the corporation may issue  from time to time in public offerings  debt securities  junior subordinated debt securities and debt warrants  currency warrants  stock index warrants and other warrants  preferred stock  depositary shares and preferred stock warrants  common stock and common stock warrants 
such securities may be offered separately or together  in one or more series  up to an aggregate of initial public offering prices of billion 
on september   the corporation sold  in a public offering  million shares of cumulative preferred stock stated value with an aggregate stated value of million 
the preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of the corporation  in whole or in part  at any time or from time to time  on or after october  at per share  plus  in each case  dividends accrued and unpaid to the redemption date 
a portion of the net proceeds received were used to redeem all of the corporation s outstanding money market cumulative preferred stock issue with an aggregate liquidation value of million as well as for general corporate purposes 
on july   the corporation sold  in a public offering  million principal amount of subordinated debentures due the debentures are direct unsecured general obligations of the corporation subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of the corporation
