the decrease in the percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in manufacturing efficiencies offset by a one time million pre tax charge for a reduction in branch office inventories 
the reduction in branch inventories was consistent with the company s shift in strategy to have its branches operate as sales execution centers rather than local distribution centers

such competition could result in lower gross margins in the future  if the company s average selling prices decrease faster than its costs  and could result in lost sales

the cost of the systems upgrade project and general improvements to the infrastructure related to this upgrade is estimated to be to million

business environment and risk factors the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
in addition  there are trends and factors beyond the company s control which affect its operations 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements contained in this report 
such trends and factors include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in general economic conditions or conditions in the specific markets for the company s products  governmental regulation  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and other factors  including those listed below 
focus on services the shift in the company s strategy to focus on its professional services as a way of providing value added solutions to its customers has risk 
the risk is that the company may not be able to generate the product sales along with the service sales or that the level of product drag along related to service sales has been overestimated 
in either situation  the loss of product sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
distribution channels the company is currently pursuing a strategy to refine and expand its distribution channels 
it is seeking to reorient its direct channel from local distribution centers to sales execution centers and focus them on major accounts 
the company is also seeking to expand its call center operations and to direct reorder business through this efficient distribution method 
in conjunction with handling inbound sales activity a new initiative is underway to generate sales through the use of outbound telemarketing 
additionally  the company is seeking to remove exclusivity from its independent distributors 
this will allow the company to institute electronic commerce as part of its distribution channel fabric 
these changes may result in temporary or permanent loss of sales people and independent distributors and the resultant loss of revenue they currently generate 
this result could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
retaining and attracting qualified personnel the company s future performance may depend in significant part upon attracting and retaining key senior management  manufacturing  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the inability to retain its current key personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in operating results factors affecting the company s operating results and gross margins include the volume of product sales  competitive pricing pressures  the ability of the company to match supply with demand  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products and services  changes in the channels through which the company s products and services are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company and its competitors  fluctuations in product costs  variations in manufacturing cycle time  fluctuations in manufacturing utilization  the ability of the company to achieve manufacturing efficiencies with its new and existing products  increased research and development expenses  exchange rate fluctuations  a change in the company s effective tax rate and changes in general economic conditions 
all of these factors are difficult to forecast and these or other factors can materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results or gross margins 
competition the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with similar or alternative document management solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features 
such competition could result in lower gross margins in the future  if the company s average selling prices decrease faster than its costs and could result in lost sales 
management system upgrades and year compliance the company is aware of problems associated with computer systems as the year approaches 
the company s initiative to upgrade its systems to better support its strategic direction and improve operational efficiencies will also mitigate current year compliance issues with internal systems 
the cost of the systems upgrade project and general improvements to the infrastructure related to this upgrade is estimated to be to million 
since the upgrade project costs are related to an overall systems initiative  the year compliance costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the costs and time schedule for the systems upgrade are based on management s best estimates for the implementation of this new management information system and infrastructure upgrades 
the company has initiated programs to identify  and mitigate to the best of its ability  any remaining internal and external risks associated with the year problem 
the risk of not meeting its timeline or problems with suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
dependence on sole source suppliers the company purchases several critical components from single or sole source vendors for which alternative sources are not currently developed 
development of alternative suppliers would require a significant amount of time to qualify in the case of certain of the company s components 
the company does not maintain long term supply agreements with any of these vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources for these single or sole source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new processes and products and manufacturing efficiencies there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing facilities will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing efficiencies in the future 
the inability of the company to achieve planned efficiencies from its manufacturing facilities could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any problems experienced by the company in its current or future transitions to new processes and products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
backlog the backlog of orders is not a significant factor in understanding the business of the company 
the nature of the company s business is such that the value of backlog represents only a small portion of the on going revenues of the business 
no one order would normally account for a significant value of backlog 
government sales with the government  both federal and state local comprising of the company s revenues  the company is primarily exposed to risks from reductions in budget allocations to support regulation and administrative offices 
the current reinventing government initiative opens opportunities to help government streamline workflow processes  reduce paperwork and increase customer service  which may provide short term opportunities for the company 
however  the long term effect of a government initiative to streamline processes could have a negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
patents  proprietary rights and related litigation the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company has been notified in the past and the company may be notified in the future of claims that they may be infringing upon patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
there can be no assurance that in the future any patents held by the company will not be invalidated  that patents will be issued for any of the company s pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in the primary countries where the company s products can be sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
additionally  competitors of the company may be able to design around the company s patents 
risks associated with international sales in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues 
fluctuations in currencies could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
because sales of the company s products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of the company s products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
manufacturing and sales of the company s products may also be materially adversely affected by factors such as unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make piracy of the company s products a more likely possibility 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management of growth the company has increased its expense levels to support its recent growth 
the company expects to continue to increase its operating expenses by hiring additional personnel to support expected growth  increased marketing efforts and additional research and development activities 
if the company does not achieve increased levels of revenues commensurate with these increased levels of operating expenses  or if the company s revenues decrease or do not meet the company s expectations for a particular period  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effect of anti takeover provisions the company has taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt that might be beneficial to stockholders who wish to receive a premium for their shares from a potential bidder 
the company has adopted a shareholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a person who attempts to acquire the company on terms not approved by the company s board of directors 
the shareholder rights plan may therefore have the effect of delaying or preventing any change in control and deterring any prospective acquisition of the company 
furthermore  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law section  which prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company
