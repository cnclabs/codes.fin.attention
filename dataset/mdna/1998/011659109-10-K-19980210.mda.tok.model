item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition industry conditions during  as part of the taxpayer relief act  the passenger ticket tax was replaced with a new system that combines a percentage tax with a per passenger segment fee 
effective october   the ticket tax is plus per segment 
the percentage tax is scheduled to decrease over time and the segment fee is scheduled to increase 
the international departure tax has increased to and a new international arrival tax has been added 
however  the act retains the rate for travel between alaska and the us mainland 
this tax and the international taxes will be indexed to the cpi beginning january  the taxpayer relief act also included these items that will affect the company and the airline industry a a new tax of on payments to air carriers for the sale of miles in frequent flyer programs  b a phased in increase from to for the deductible percentage of per diems paid to flight crews  and c faster cost recovery for alternative minimum tax purposes of aircraft purchased in and later years 
during  fuel prices increased significantly for the company and most of its competitors approximately or cents per gallon over levels for alaska airlines 
during  fuel prices decreased approximately from levels 
results of operations compared with consolidated net income in was million  or per share basic and per share diluted  compared with net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted in consolidated operating income was million in compared with million in of the million improvement  million occurred in the fourth quarter 
severe winter storms  high fuel prices and matching of competitors lower fares adversely affected the fourth quarter 
alaska s annual operating income improved by million  while horizon s improved by million 
a discussion of operating results for the two airlines follows 
alaska airlines operating income increased to million  resulting in a operating margin as compared to a margin in operating revenue per available seat mile asm increased to cents while operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
the increase in revenue per asm was due to a increase in system passenger yield combined with a point improvement in passenger load factor 
most markets  including the three largest pacific northwest southern california  seattle anchorage and pacific northwest northern california  experienced increases in yields 
most markets also experienced increases in load factor including the seattle anchorage market  which had a point improvement 
the higher yields and load factors reflect a more stabilized competitive environment in freight and mail revenues decreased in the first half of due to more competition and increased in the second half due to increased cargo capacity and higher mail rates 
other net revenues were essentially unchanged because an additional million of proceeds from partners in alaska s frequent flyer program were offset by a similar increase in the frequent flyer award liability 
the table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per available seat mile asm basis in and alaska airlines operating expenses per asm in cents change change wages and benefits

alaska airlines total 
nm not meaningful alaska s higher unit costs were primarily due to increased labor costs 
significant unit cost changes are discussed below 
employees increased primarily in reservations and customer service positions to service the increase in passengers and also to improve on time within minutes flight departure performance  which improved from on time in to on time in excluding profit sharing  average wages and benefits per employee were up  primarily due to higher pilot wage rates and higher health insurance costs 
the net effect was that wages and benefits expense increased more than the asm growth  resulting in a increase in cost per asm 
profit sharing expense increased the cost per asm by 
cents 
effective for  alaska changed its profit sharing program so that eligible employees will receive their pro rata share of of alaska s adjusted pre tax profits starting with the first dollar of pre tax profits 
fuel expense per asm decreased  primarily due to a decrease in the price of fuel 
maintenance expense per asm increased because significantly more engine repair expense was incurred in and a smaller proportion of airframe maintenance costs were capitalized 
commission expense per asm increased  less than the increase in passenger revenues because a lower percentage of sales were made by travel agents 
in addition  the commission rate paid to travel agents decreased from to for sales made after september  the gain on sale of assets in is primarily due to the sale of three jet aircraft 
other expense per asm increased  primarily due to higher costs related to property and other taxes  flight crew hotels  employee hiring and communications 
horizon air operating income increased from million to million  resulting in a operating margin as compared to a zero margin in for  operating revenue per asm increased to cents while operating expenses per available seat mile remained even at cents 
the increase in revenue per asm was due to a point increase in system passenger load factor  partially offset by a decrease in passenger yield 
the seattle to canada  seattle to montana and the seattle boise markets experienced significant increases in load factors 
the decrease in yields is believed to be due to a longer average passenger trip length in and to the presence of the passenger transportation tax for months in versus months in the table below shows the major operating expense elements on a cost per asm basis for horizon in and horizon air operating expenses per asm in cents change change wages and benefits

horizon air total nm not meaningful wages and benefits per asm increased  primarily due to higher wage rates  payroll taxes and more k plan employer matching costs 
profit sharing expense increased due to profitable operations 
contracted services increased due to higher security screening and hiring costs 
food and beverage decreased due to a conscious effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency 
other expense decreased due to less flight crew training and personnel costs  lower insurance rates and decreased supplies expense 
consolidated nonoperating income expense nonoperating expense decreased million to million  primarily due to smaller average debt balances  lower interest rates on variable interest rate debt and more interest capitalized 
compared with consolidated net income in was million  or per share basic and per share diluted  compared with net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted in consolidated operating income was million compared with million in alaska s operating income improved by million  but it was offset by lower operating results at horizon 
alaska airlines operating income increased to million  resulting in a operating margin as compared with a margin in operating revenue per available seat mile asm increased to cents while operating expenses per asm decreased to cents 
the increase in revenue per asm was primarily due to a point improvement in system passenger load factor 
higher unit costs were largely due to higher fuel prices and heavier passenger loads 
horizon air operating income decreased to million primarily due to the fourth quarter  which was negatively impacted by adverse weather  increased competition  higher than normal maintenance expense and costs associated with transitioning to a simplified fleet 
consolidated nonoperating income expense nonoperating expense decreased from million to million primarily due to lower interest rates on variable debt and smaller average debt balances
