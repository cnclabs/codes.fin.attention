item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company believes that it is a leading manufacturer of fabricated wire products  industrial wire and carbon steel rod for the agricultural  industrial  construction  original equipment manufacturer and retail consumer markets and believes it is the second largest manufacturer of fabricated wire products and industrial wire in the united states based on tons produced  in 
the company s operations benefit from vertical integration as the company s mini mill supplies carbon steel rod produced from scrap steel to its downstream fabricated wire products and industrial wire operations 
these downstream fabrication operations accounted for of net sales 
the company s fabricated wire products typically yield higher and less volatile gross margins compared to rod 
management believes that keystone s fabricated wire businesses insulate it better than other rod producers from the effects of rod imports and new domestic rod production capacity 
moreover  the company s rod production costs have historically been below the market price for rod providing a significant cost advantage over wire producers who purchase rod as a raw material 
the company s estimated current fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity is  tons 
utilization of the company s annual fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity aggregated in  in and in recent modifications to the company s steel making operations increased annual billet production capacity from approximately  tons to  tons  while the current estimated annual production capacity of the company s rod mill is approximately  tons 
in and  the company s steel making operations operated at near capacity and  together with billet purchases of  tons and  tons in and  respectively  provided  tons and  tons of billets in and  respectively 
these increased billet volumes  resulted in rod production increasing from  tons of estimated capacity in to  tons of estimated capacity in in november  the company entered into a joint venture agreement and formed ewp 
the company had a equity interest in ewp together with an option to acquire the remaining 
on december   keystone purchased the of ewp not already owned by the company the ewp acquisition 
keystone paid a total of million in cash  using available funds  to acquire the remaining of ewp and assumed ewp s liabilities 
ewp is now a wholly owned subsidiary of keystone 
in  the company contributed to ewp  among other things  certain equipment as part of its capital contribution 
as a result  through december  the company did not sell the fabricated wire products previously manufactured on the equipment contributed to ewp 
during  the company manufactured  tons of these fabricated wire products as compared to  tons in as part of the joint venture agreement  the company supplied ewp with the majority of its rod requirements 
ewp then converted the rod to fabricated wire products which were primarily used in the concrete pipe and road construction businesses 
during  and  the company shipped  tons   tons and  tons  respectively  of rod to ewp 
pro forma consolidated net sales and operating income for keystone in  assuming the ewp acquisition was completed on january   approximated million and million  respectively 
the company s profitability is dependent in large part on its ability to utilize effectively its production capacity  which is affected by the availability of raw material  plant efficiency and other production factors and to control its manufacturing costs  which are comprised primarily of raw materials  energy and labor costs 
the company s primary raw material is scrap steel 
the price of scrap steel is highly volatile and scrap steel prices are affected by periodic shortages  freight costs  weather and other conditions largely beyond the control of the company 
although the average per ton price paid for scrap by the company was relatively constant during  and  and  respectively  prices can vary widely from period to period and the company s product selling prices cannot always be adjusted  especially in the short term  to recover the costs of large increases in scrap prices 
the company consumes a significant amount of energy in its manufacturing operations and  accordingly  its profitability can also be adversely affected by the volatility in the price of coal  oil and natural gas resulting in increased energy  transportation  freight  scrap and supply costs 
the company purchases electrical energy for its peoria  illinois facility from a regulated utility under an interruptible service contract which provides for more economical electricity rates but allows the utility to refuse or interrupt power to the company s manufacturing facilities during periods of peak demand 
the utility has in the past refused or interrupted service to the company resulting in decreased production and higher costs associated with the related downtime 
as a result of the acquisition of desoto in september  the company is also engaged in the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products 
as the operations of desoto are insignificant when compared to the consolidated operations of the company in and  and are expected to continue to be insignificant in the future  desoto s results of operations are not separately addressed in the discussion that follows 
the statements in this annual report on form k relating to matters that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements found in item business and item legal proceedings  and in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  cost of raw materials  future supply and demand for the company s products including cyclicality thereof  general economic conditions  competitive products and substitute products  customer and competitor strategies  the impact of pricing and production decisions  environmental matters  government regulations and possible changes therein  and the ultimate resolution of pending litigation and possible future litigation as discussed in this annual report  including  without limitation  the sections referenced above

net income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased in from fabricated wire products represented of net sales in and in  industrial wire represented in and in  and carbon steel rod represented in and in fabricated wire product prices decreased approximately while shipments increased in from during  industrial wire prices remained level with prices while shipments increased from carbon steel rod prices increased as shipments decreased from to gross profit increased approximately to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in as increased selling prices and lower pension expense and scrap costs more than offset higher rod conversion costs 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons at per ton in the desoto acquisition in september included the simultaneous merger of the company s and desoto s defined benefit pension plans and as a result  pension expense charged to cost of goods sold in was nil as compared to when the company charged pension expense of approximately million to cost of goods sold 
during  the company recorded a non cash pension credit of approximately million and currently estimates  for financial reporting purposes  that it will recognize a non cash pension credit of approximately million in and  does not anticipate cash contributions for defined benefit pension plan fundings will be required in however  future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases in pension expense or credit and future funding requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  in this decrease was primarily a result of lower environmental expenses in partially offset by a million charge to bad debt expense recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from a severe deterioration in a customer s financial condition 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected total accrued liabilities of million to cover estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
although the company has established an accrual for estimated future required environmental remediation costs  there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company recorded a pre tax gain in other income of approximately million resulting from the sale of a building that was used by one of the company s former operating divisions 
the operating division was sold in  but the company retained the building 
interest expense in was higher than due principally to higher average borrowing levels and higher average interest rates 
on august   the company issued million of senior secured notes the senior notes 
the net proceeds to the company from the issuance of the senior notes were approximately million 
the company used million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and to retire amounts outstanding under the company s term loan the term loan 
both the company s revolving credit facility and term loan bore interest at over the prime rate effective rate of on december  and had an original maturity date of december  average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximated million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan was per annum as compared to in as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  the company expects higher average borrowing levels and interest rates in will result in increased interest expense as compared to the level 
the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s deferred tax position at december  is also explained in note to the consolidated financial statements and in liquidity and capital resources 
during the fourth quarter of  based upon revisions in the company s estimate of liabilities for income taxes  keystone reduced its consolidated accrual for income taxes by million 
this change in estimate considered a settlement with the internal revenue service the irs  in the fourth quarter  of a matter related to an appeal of proposed adjustments by the irs for the through tax years on a more favorable basis than originally anticipated 
the effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
as a result of the items discussed above  net income during increased to million from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to from 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased in from fabricated wire products represented of sales in and in  industrial wire represented in both and  and carbon steel rod represented in and in fabricated wire product prices increased approximately while shipments decreased in from this decrease in shipments was primarily due to the closing of the company s west coast distribution facility and  as discussed previously  the contribution of certain equipment to the ewp joint venture in shipments of fabricated wire products by keystone s remaining facilities increased slightly in but were more than offset by the decline of  tons of fabricated wire products due to the closure of the west coast distribution facility in industrial wire prices decreased approximately in while shipments also decreased from to carbon steel rod prices decreased as shipments increased from to this increase in rod shipments was due in part to increased purchases by ewp 
gross profit increased approximately to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in  as lower overall product per ton selling prices were more than offset by a more favorable product sales mix of fabricated wire products  lower scrap and purchased billet costs and lower pension expense 
during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons at per ton in as a result of the desoto acquisition in september  pension expense decreased in  as compared to during and the company charged pension expense of approximately million and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold 
selling expenses decreased to million in from million in but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in this increase was primarily a result of higher expenses related to the company s environmental remediation project at its peoria  illinois facility million in as compared to million in  increased insurance costs due to abnormally low levels in and costs incurred in connection with a possible joint venture that  upon termination of discussions with the potential joint venture partner  were charged to expense in interest expense in was higher than due principally to higher average borrowing levels primarily due to decreased profitability in as well as payments made in connection with the desoto acquisition 
average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximated million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company was per annum as compared to per annum in the effective tax rates were comparable between and as a result of the items discussed above  net income during decreased to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
liquidity and capital resources on august   the company issued the senior notes which are due in august and are collateralized by a second priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future fixed assets of the company 
a portion of the million net proceeds was used to retire the company s term loan and repay borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the balance of the net proceeds are available for the company s general corporate purposes  including financing capital expenditures 
the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture the indenture which  among other things  provides for optional redemptions  mandatory redemptions and certain covenants including provisions that  among other things  limit the ability of the company to sell capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into sale and leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates  create new liens and incur additional debt 
the indenture also limits the ability of the company to pay dividends or make other restricted payments  as defined 
at december   the company had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its million revolving credit facility at december  the amount of available borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility is based on formula determined amounts of trade receivables and inventories  less the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
under the terms of the indenture  the company s ability to borrow in excess of million under the revolving credit facility is dependent upon maintenance of a consolidated cash flow ratio as defined  for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of at least to available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which expires december   were million at december  however  under the terms of the indenture  borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  would be limited to approximately million 
during  the company s operating activities provided approximately million of cash  compared to  of cash provided by operating activities in in addition to higher earnings in as compared to  cash flow from operations was impacted by changes in relative levels of assets and liabilities  including levels of pension fundings in excess of pension expense 
during  keystone was not required to fund any contributions to its defined benefit pension plan and the company recorded a pension credit of approximately million 
defined benefit pension plan contributions million exceeded pension expense million by approximately million in the company does not expect to be required to make contributions to the pension plan during future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases to pension expense or credit and funding requirements in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  desoto received approximately million from one of its insurers in exchange for releasing the insurer from coverage for certain years of environmental related liabilities 
such amount is included in the company s self insurance accruals at december  immediately following the desoto acquisition  keystone was obligated to  and did  cause desoto to pay certain of desoto s trade creditors the trade credit group of the balance of the trade payables then due to the trade credit group 
the remaining of the balance million due to the trade credit group  plus interest at  was paid by desoto in february the company repaid the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan with a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the senior notes 
in addition  the company anticipates applying the remaining net proceeds to fund a portion of its capital improvements plan and for general corporate purposes 
until used  the net proceeds of the senior notes will be invested in short term investment grade securities or money market funds 
prior to its acquisition by keystone  desoto received a report of tax examination changes from the irs that proposed adjustments resulting in additional taxes  penalties  and interest for the years through desoto filed a formal appeal of the proposed adjustments  and in prior years  accrued an estimate of its liability related to this matter 
in the fourth quarter of  desoto settled the matter with the irs for a payment of approximately million  including interest of approximately million 
such payment was less than previously accrued amounts and  as such  in the fourth quarter  keystone reduced its consolidated accrual for income taxes by million 
during  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily related to upgrades of production equipment and an information systems project at its facility in peoria  illinois 
during  the company commenced a three year  million capital improvement plan to upgrade certain of its plant and equipment and eliminate production capacity bottlenecks in order to reduce costs and improve production efficiency 
the principal components of the company s capital improvements plan include reconfiguring its electric arc furnace  replacing the caster and upgrading its wire and rod mills 
capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be approximately million and are related primarily to upgrades of  as well as additional  production equipment 
these capital expenditures will be funded using available cash and borrowing availability under the company s revolving credit facilities 
in december  desoto entered into an agreement to settle its liability as a potentially responsible party with respect to alleged hazardous substance contamination of the american chemical site  a chemical recycling facility located in griffith  indiana  for a cash payment of million 
such amount was within the previously accrued balance and desoto expects to pay the million during the first half of in february  the company entered into an agreement with insteel wire products company insteel  to purchase insteel s agricultural fencing product manufacturing equipment and related inventory for approximately million  subject to any adjustment due to a physical inventory 
keystone expects to incur additional capital costs of to million to relocate and integrate such equipment into its manufacturing facilities 
as part of the agreement with insteel  keystone also acquired insteel s former customer list and certain other records and insteel agreed not to compete with keystone in the north american agricultural fencing products business for a period of five years 
the company incurs significant ongoing costs for plant and equipment and substantial employee medical benefits for both current and retired employees 
as such  the company is vulnerable to business downturns and increases in costs  and accordingly  routinely compares its liquidity requirements and capital needs against its estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past  and may in the future  reduce controllable costs  modify product mix  acquire and dispose of businesses  restructure certain indebtedness  and raise additional equity capital 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for similar actions or other measures in the future in order to meet its obligations 
the company also routinely evaluates acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company 
the company s ability to incur new debt in the future is limited by the terms of the indenture 
management believes the cash flows from operations together with available cash and the funds available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient funds to fund the anticipated needs of its operations and capital improvements plan for the year ending december  this belief is based upon management s assessment of various financial and operational factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions relating to product shipments  product mix and selling prices  production schedules  productivity rates  raw materials  electricity  labor  employee benefits and other fixed and variable costs  working capital requirements  interest rates  repayments of long term debt  capital expenditures  and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
however  liabilities under environmental laws and regulations with respect to the clean up and disposal of wastes  any significant increases in the cost of providing medical coverage to active and retired employees could have a material adverse effect on the future liquidity  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
additionally  significant declines in the company s end user markets or market share  the inability to maintain satisfactory billet and rod production levels  or other unanticipated costs  if significant  could result in a need for funds greater than the company currently has available 
there can be no assurance the company would be able to obtain an adequate amount of additional financing 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
the company is in the process of evaluating the modifications to existing software and new software required to mitigate the year issue 
the company has also initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to minimize their own year issue 
the company will utilize both internal and external sources to reprogram or replace and test its software  and it expects to complete its evaluation in the first half of and to have any required modifications completed prior to december  however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
because the company has not completed the evaluation of its year issue  it is not able to quantify the costs that may be incurred in order to eliminate its year issue 
the date on which the company plans to complete any necessary year modifications is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
