item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations annual results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that consolidated statement of operations items are to net sales for the years ended june   and year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales net sales in fiscal decreased to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreases in unit volume shipments and average selling prices asps of approximately of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of portable products of million were approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately million or of the company s net sales in fiscal as compared to approximately million or in fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million  or  above the million reported in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in the unit volume shipments of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal but was partly offset by the decrease in asps of approximately from asps 
sales of portable products increased to approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal from only in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products declined to approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal from approximately in fiscal the company has made a major effort to design products to fill the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers 
sales to leading pc systems manufacturers represented approximately of net sales for fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal  and in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  korea and japan  accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales to two customers accounted for approximately and of net sales for fiscal sales to three customers accounted for approximately  and of net sales for fiscal  and approximately   and of net sales for fiscal substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales to distributors 
sales to distributors represented and of net sales during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
during the first half of fiscal year the company experienced higher than usual returns resulting from certain distributors adjusting their inventory mix and levels 
the company plans to develop new and higher performance gui accelerators  graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
the company s future success depends upon its successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin trident s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margins were generally lower in fiscal because of decreasing prices in the personal computer industry and a product mix which was more heavily weighted towards desktop computers which have lower margins than portable computer products 
trident s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of a product mix which was more heavily weighted towards notebook gui accelerators with higher gross margins 
the company believes that the prices of high technology products decline over time  as competition increases and new  advanced products are introduced 
the company expects asps of existing products to continue to decline  although the asps of the company s entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are planned to be sold at higher prices 
the company s strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins through its custom design methodology and migration to new process technology  and reducing manufacturing costs by large volume production 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that it can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in spending in multimedia engineering  graphics engineering  the taiwan research and development center costs and the start up of the shanghai research and development center 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in headcount and associated personnel related costs  increased depreciation  and increased non recurring engineering expenses and outside engineering services resulting from the company s increased research and development efforts during as a result of the company s cost reduction efforts  the company expects research and development expenses to remain at or below the levels for fiscal during fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenditures decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and were million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling expenditures were million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures were to million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling costs in fiscal were lower than fiscal due to the slow down in personal computer sales and reductions in marketing personnel 
selling costs in fiscal were higher than in fiscal due to additional staffing for an oem sales team and increased marketing personnel 
general and administrative expenditures were lower in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to reductions in bonus expenses  personnel  and consulting services 
general and administrative expenditures were higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to increases in additional human resources and information systems personnel 
as a result of the company s cost reduction efforts  the company expects selling  general and administrative expenditures to remain at or below the levels for fiscal during fiscal interest income  net the amount of interest income earned by the company varies directly with the amount of its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and the prevailing interest rates 
net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to cash investments being held in higher yielding certificates of deposit 
interest income decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of declining interest rates in fiscal a significant amount of the interest earned by the company during fiscal was not subject to income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes  the provision benefit for income tax was for fiscal year  and for fiscal years and the effective income tax rate was below the statutory rate primarily because of operations in foreign countries with lower income tax rates 
in addition  a significant portion of earned interest was not subject to federal income tax in fiscal based on a number of factors  as of june  the company has provided a valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding their realization 
these factors include primarily recent operating losses incurred by the company  the fact that the market in which the company competes is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  relatively short duration for carry forwards of state tax losses  and statutory prohibition on carry back of state tax losses 
future results  forward looking statements this report contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including the completion of the uicc foundry  trends in the graphics marketplace  the introduction of new products and new technologies in the company s products and expectations regarding expense levels 
such forward looking statements represent management s current expectations  are not guarantees and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary significantly from those expected by the company 
the significant factors that could affect actual results include those specified below  as well as those specifically identified elsewhere in this report 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its operating results in the past and anticipates such fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including seasonal customer demand particularly during the summer when sales of pcs have traditionally been slower  the timing of new product introductions  the acceptance of new products  economic fluctuations  including fluctuations in asia in particular  competitive pressures on average selling prices  the availability of foundry and assembly capacities and changes in the mix of products sold and changes in the company s customer mix 
the company s prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indicator of future performance 
future results will depend substantially upon the company s ability to bring new products and technologies to market on a timely basis  and upon the acceptance of those products 
also  future results will depend upon the market s acceptance of the company s customers products which incorporate the company s products  and the amount and timing of expenditures for research and development  and for selling  general and administrative functions 
operating results have also been adversely affected by fluctuations in the market for desktop or portable pcs  the company s ability to predict product demand and manage its inventory  and order cancellations or rescheduling 
the company currently expects to report operating losses for the next several quarters and cannot accurately predict when it will return to profitability 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to distributors 
the company has limited control over the extent to which products sold to distributors are sold through to end users 
accordingly  a portion of the company s sales may from time to time result in increased inventory at its distributors 
the company provides reserves for returns and allowances for distributor inventories 
these reserves are based on the company s estimates of inventory held by its distributors and the expected sell through of its products by its distributors 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s future operating results also may be affected by various factors that are beyond its control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions  political instability  governmental regulation or intervention affecting the personal computer industry  government regulation resulting from us foreign and trade policy  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates particularly in relation to the us dollar and asian currencies 
because the company s customers distribute their products worldwide  changes in the global graphics marketplace  such as the shift in market share from asian clone makers to leading north american pc systems manufacturers  have affected and will continue to affect the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company s operating results will fluctuate with changes in the asian economies  particularly those of taiwan and hong kong  since the company s revenues have been and are expected to be generated primarily from customers in asia 
the market for graphics controllers has become increasingly competitive  and the company s results have been and in the future may be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors  including the development of new technologies  the incorporation of graphics functionality into other components and claims by third parties of infringement of patent or similar intellectual property rights 
the company s products are extremely complex devices 
the company establishes and implements test specifications and imposes quality standards upon its suppliers and also performs separate application based compatibility and system testing for its products 
however  its customers may discover defects in the company s products related to their particular application 
to the extent that the company is unable to remedy defects or provide products able to meet its customers requirements  the company may experience lower revenues and excess inventories which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company currently relies on several independent foundries to manufacture its products either in finished form or wafer form 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with the company or the company s supply from a foundry is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  such as a natural disaster  the company may not have sufficient time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
while the company has made significant investments to secure foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that it will obtain sufficient foundry capacity to meet customer demand in the future  particularly if that demand should increase 
the company is continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and in the future could take  longer than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that capacity from current foundries and new foundry sources will be available to satisfy the company s requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or per unit prices 
in addition  the company s products are assembled and tested by several independent subcontractors 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturing  assembly and testing houses involves a number of risks  including the lack of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality assurance and costs 
constraints or delays in the supply of the company s products  because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the foundries or assembly or testing houses  delays in obtaining additional production at existing foundries or from new foundries  shortages of raw materials  or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers and other material adverse effects on the company s operating results  particularly if the company is forced to purchase products from higher cost foundries or pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply in a timely manner 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results and general conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
sales are not expected to increase significantly until an economic recovery in east asia and the introduction of the company s next generation products 
no assurance can be made as to the time  if any  at which there will be a recovery 
future sales growth  if any  may strain company resources 
in particular increased sales to large system manufacturers in diverse markets and the resulting requirements for design support would place substantial demands on trident s research and development and sales functions 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any further growth will depend upon its ability to manage and expand its foundry relationships 
should trident s management fail to expand these functions to keep pace with growth should it occur  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to unprofitable operations  an increase in inventory  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  primarily offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  decreases in inventory and other assets  and partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal years   and the company issued   and  shares of common stock  respectively 
these issuances generated cash of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  the company invested million in cash in a privately held semiconductor design company for an equity interest of less than 
the investment is presented as a long term investment in the financial statements 
in august  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with umc and other venture partners to establish a foundry  uicc 
under the agreement  the company invested million in the joint venture and the foundry guarantees to trident of the foundry s total wafer supply 
on october   a fire at uicc s fabrication plant in hsin chu  taiwan  completely destroyed its fabrication equipment 
the fabrication plant  and the destroyed equipment  was insured 
trident was not utilizing the uicc fabrication plant  and there are no existing trident products on uicc s production lines 
the uicc foundry is being rebuilt and is expected to be in production in at june   the company held a equity ownership in uicc 
the company s investment in the uicc joint venture is intended to secure capacity so that it can meet expected increased demand  should it occur 
however  there are certain risks associated with the transaction including the company s ability  together with its partners  to fully utilize the capacity of uicc 
the company will continue to consider transactions to secure additional foundry capacity as circumstances warrant 
the agreement with umc has utilized a significant amount of trident s available funds  however the company believes its current resources are sufficient to meet its needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company regularly considers transactions to finance its activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions 
the company believes its current reserves are adequate 
in april   the company s board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program over the next twelve months 
during fiscal year   shares of common stock were repurchased for million under this plan 
during fiscal year  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
the company s cash reserves may decline as a result of its future use  if any  of the repurchase program 
year the company has a year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  and suppliers that are not year compliant and to develop  implement  and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
the project is composed of four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and implementation and testing 
information systems 
in  the company undertook a project to upgrade all its information systems to year compliance 
products 
the company has assessed the capabilities of all of its products sold to customers 
based on the assessments made to date  none of the company s products are affected by year issues 
operations and infrastructure 
office equipment and other items used in the operations and facilities of the company are currently being assessed for year compliance to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal suppliers 
the company is also in the process of evaluating its supplier base to determine whether year issues affecting suppliers will adversely impact the company s operations 
to mitigate this risk  the company has contacted all of its suppliers to assess their year readiness and will continue to monitor the progress of its key suppliers 
the company has a limited number of key suppliers and expects to have the assessment of these key suppliers completed during the next six months 
general and risk factors 
the company s year project is currently in the assessment phase and  with respect to certain information systems and products  in the remediation phase 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks are associated with its information systems and systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure 
the company is at the beginning stage of assessments for its operations and infrastructure  and cannot predict whether significant problems will be identified 
the company has not yet determined the extent of contingency planning that may be required 
based on the status of the assessment made and remediation plans developed to date  the company is not in a position to state the total cost of remediation of all year issues 
costs identified to date are expected to be not less than  item a
