in august  ilex purchased a equity stake in a german based contract research organization  which has been renamed pfk ilex 
together  the two firms are pursuing a leadership position in the european market for clinical research in oncology  offering clients simultaneous development of their oncology compounds in both the united states and europe 
ilex initiated phase ii clinical trials of its drug piritrexim related to bladder cancer in august and  in september  launched a phase ii trial of dfmo related to breast cancer 
also in september  ilex restructured its business into two wholly owned subsidiaries one to develop ilex s portfolio of anticancer products and one to provide contract research services to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
ilex has no products available for sale and does not expect to have any products resulting from its drug development efforts  including its collaborations with others  commercially available for at least the next two years  if at all

the company s revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to development funding under its collaborative relationships  fee for service revenues pursuant to contracts with its contract research organization cro clients  interest income and other miscellaneous income 
until its initial public offering in february  the company had financed its operations primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock  through development funding provided by its collaborative partners under its collaborative agreements  through licensing fees and milestone payments with its cro clients 
the development funding received by the company pursuant to collaborative agreements often includes payments for research to support the development of specific compounds  recorded as development revenue  and licensing fees and milestone payments recorded as licensing fees 
ilex s collaborative agreements are generally conducted on a best efforts basis and payments for research are recognized based on the time incurred on the related studies 
the company is reimbursed for investigator costs based on actual costs incurred or at predetermined rates plus out of pocket costs incurred during the performance of the study 
revenues related to milestone payments are recognized upon the achievement of the related milestone and when collection is probable 
ilex also derives revenue from performing cro services for companies within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in general  the company provides cro services to a client based on a pre specified contract cost that may be adjusted during the term of the project 
the terms of the company s engagements vary  ranging from less than one month to several years  and generally may be terminated upon notice of days or less by the client 
the company recognizes revenue with respect to its cro services on a percentage of completion basis as work is performed 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with collaborative agreements 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other entities which conduct certain research activities on behalf of the company 
during the years ended december    and  the company had one collaborative research agreement that accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively

the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the company for  and it should be read in conjunction with the interim financial statements of the company  the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations ilex expects that results of operations in the future will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations may result from numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenues earned under existing or future collaborative relationships or joint ventures  if any  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of compounds  the progress of the company s drug development programs  the receipt of regulatory approvals  acquisitions  the timing of start up expenses for new facilities  changes in the company s mix of services  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competing products and technologies and the timing and availability of financing for the company  including existing or future strategic alliances and joint ventures with third parties 
in addition  with respect to the company s contract research services revenues  fluctuations may result due to a number of factors  including the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts and progress of ongoing contracts 
ilex believes that comparisons of its quarterly and annual historical results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
to date  the majority of the company s expenditures have been for research and development activities including associated general and administrative expense and losses incurred by joint ventures 
the company does not expect to receive royalties or other revenues based upon net sales of drugs that may be developed for a significant number of years  if at all 
ilex expects research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as its development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses necessary to support such expanded programs are also expected to increase over the next several years 
comparison of years ended december  and operating revenues total revenue increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of approximately million  or  was due to an additional million of product development revenues and million of contract research revenues offset by a decrease of million in licensing fees 
the million increase in product development revenues  to million  compares to million in the increase primarily reflects additional revenue from license and development agreements signed in the fourth quarter of relating to piritrexim and crisnatol  as well as revenues from the leukosite joint venture for the development of campath h 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues with respect to the development of mgbg 
the million increase in contract research services revenues  to million  compared to approximately million in  reflects an increase in both the number of contracts underway as well as in the size and complexity of the contract research projects 
operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased from approximately million in to million in this increase of approximately million  or  was due to an increase in research and development costs  general and administrative costs  subcontractor costs  and prn amortization and accrual expenses 
ilex anticipates that general and administrative expenses will substantially increase as the company increases the number of products in development  product in licenses and collaborations 
ilex believes that research and development costs will increase substantially in future periods as the company expands its preclinical and clinical trials associated with developing additional compounds 
research and development costs 
research and development costs increased from approximately million in to million in this increase of million  or  was primarily attributable to spending approximately million in connection with the development of dfmo and million on campath h exclusive of manufacturing 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs increased from approximately million in to million in this increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to increases in rental expense  legal costs  business development activities and compensation related to additional administrative staff 
costs of contract research services 
contract research services costs increased from million in to million in this increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to increases in expenditures required to support growth in the number and size of contract research contracts 
subcontractor costs 
subcontractor costs increased from million in to million in this increase of million is primarily due to increases in expenditures required to support growth in the company s contract research services operations 
prn amortization and accrual 
amortization of the cost of the initial shares granted to prn and the accrual of anticipated cost of issuing future milestone payments was million in since the collaborative relationship with prn was not entered into until july  there were no expenses for the comparable period in operating loss the loss from operations increased from million in to million in this increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to increased spending on ilex s portfolio products which have not yet been partnered for development  including increased spending associated with the development of dfmo and campath 
equity in losses in joint ventures and european affiliate equity in losses in joint ventures was million in  and in the european affiliate was  for since the joint ventures were not formed until december and may  respectively  and the agreement with the european cro was concluded in august  the comparable expenses for were limited to million 
net interest income net interest income increased from approximately million in to million in this increase of million  or  is attributable to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities from proceeds received from ilex s initial public offering of common stock completed in february and private placements of the company s securities completed in the last quarter of net income loss the net loss increased million during  or  from million in to million in earnings net loss per share the net loss per share increased from per share in to in  a change of per share 
this was primarily attributable to increased spending on the product portfolio and the expenses associated with the prn collaboration 
comparison of years ended december  and total revenue increased from approximately million in the year ended december  to million in the increase of million  or  was due to an additional million of licensing fee revenue   of product development revenue  and  of contract research services revenue 
the licensing fee revenue was received pursuant to collaborations with janssen  mgi pharma and the mpi joint venture  as well as from a milestone payment from sanofi 
the incremental product development revenues were attributable to increased revenues received by the company under its product development agreements with sanofi and janssen 
the increase in contract research services revenues was a result of an increased number of contracts 
total operating expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended december  to million in this increase of million  or  was primarily a result of increases in costs of contract research services of million associated with the start up of the company s manufacturing facilities  which commenced operations in early  subcontractor costs of  relating to increases in expenditures required to support the company s contract research services operations and research and development costs of approximately  primarily due to costs associated with mgbg 
in addition  operating expenses increased by approximately million due to increases in general and administrative expenses associated with increased compensation primarily as a result of increased number of personnel and  to a lesser extent  business development costs 
net interest income increased from approximately  in the year ended december   to  in this increase of  is attributable to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities from proceeds received from sales of convertible preferred stock completed in and ilex expects that results of operations in the future will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations may result from numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenues earned under existing or future collaborative relationships or joint ventures  if any  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of compounds  the progress of the company s drug development programs  the receipt of regulatory approvals  acquisitions  the timing of start up expenses for new facilities  changes in the company s mix of services  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competing products and technologies and the timing and availability of financing for the company  including existing or future strategic alliances and joint ventures with third parties 
in addition  with respect to the company s contract research services revenues  fluctuations may result due to a number of factors  including the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts and progress of ongoing contracts 
ilex believes that comparisons of its quarterly and annual historical results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
income taxes the availability of the nol carryforward to reduce us federal taxable income is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  in the event of an ownership change as defined in section of the code 
the company experienced a change in ownership interest in excess of percent as defined under the code upon the consummation of its offering of series b convertible preferred stock 
the company does not believe that this change in ownership significantly impacts the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of december   because the amount of the annual limitation under the code of such carryforwards is in excess of the total amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company did not experience a change in control under the code as the result of its initial public offering 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
liquidity and capital resources ilex has financed its operations primarily through the sale of its capital stock  through development and licensing fee revenues provided by its collaborative partners under its collaborative agreements and through fee for service or participatory revenues pursuant to contracts with its cro clients 
the company receives payments under collaborative agreements primarily in the form of development funding  milestone payments  if milestones are achieved  and royalties  if products are commercialized 
to date  the majority of the company s expenditures have been for research and development activities  including associated general and administrative expense and losses incurred by joint ventures 
the company does not expect to receive royalties or other revenues based upon sales of products that may be developed for a significant number of years  if at all 
ilex expects research and development expenses to increase significantly for the next several years 
as its development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses necessary to support such expanded programs are also expected to increase over the next several years 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
the company believes that such amounts will be used primarily to support continued research and development of its compounds  expand its cro services business  for general and administrative expenses and for other general corporate purposes 
at december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
ilex s future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of its preclinical and clinical testing  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or termination of existing collaborative arrangements  the ability of the company to establish  maintain and avoid termination of collaborative arrangements and the purchase of capital equipment and acquisitions of compounds  technologies or businesses 
the company s cash requirements are expected to continue to increase each year as it expands its activities and operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever be able to generate product revenue or achieve or sustain profitability 
year compliance the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent on its computer software programs and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
these programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including information management services and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company has been evaluating its programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems  as well as manual processes  external interfaces with customers  and services supplied by vendors to coordinate year compliance and conversion 
the year problem refers to the limitations of the programming code in certain existing software programs to recognize date sensitive information for the year and beyond 
unless modified prior to the year  such systems may not properly recognize such information and could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail to operate properly 
based on current information  the company expects to attain year compliance and institute appropriate testing of its modifications and replacements in a timely fashion and in advance of the year date change 
it is anticipated that modification or replacement of the company s programs and systems will be performed in house by company personnel 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will not pose a significant operational problem for the company 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computers may not interface properly with the company s computer systems 
the company could be adversely affected by the year problem if it or unrelated parties fail to successfully address this issue 
management of the company currently anticipates that the expenses and capital expenditures associated with its year compliance project will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations
