total revenues fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
total revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  revenues from proprietary games operations were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily due to increased equity earnings in the company s joint venture alliance with igt  which  for accounting purposes  is recorded net of expense 
at june  there were more than  games  primarily wheel of fortune  operating within the joint venture  compared to more than  games at june  this increase is also due to increased revenues from the company s proprietary games wheel of gold and totem pole  and to a lesser extent increased revenues from the proprietary games rock n reels and safebuster 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased revenues generated from the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike and decreased revenues generated from the proprietary game clear winner 
the company expects the trend of reduced year to year silver strike and clear winner revenue comparisons to continue due to the market maturity of these proprietary games 
after completing a full year of operations within the joint venture alliance with igt  we now recognize that these operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations as a result of weather and casino patron traffic patterns 
we expect that these seasonal trends will continue in both our joint venture operations and our proprietary games operations outside of the joint venture 
revenues from casino operations were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily due to increased slot revenues at the colorado central station casino and  to a lesser extent  increased slot revenues at the colorado grande casino 
the company s colorado casino operations were the beneficiary of mild weather during the six months ended june  the competitive landscape has begun to change recently in the black hawk market 
on june  a competitor opened a new casino  as expected  near the colorado central station casino 
the company expects the opening of another new casino by a competitor  also near the colorado central station casino  during december the company is aware of other casino projects in various stages of planning in the black hawk market 
the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that the new or proposed casino openings will have on the company s colorado casino operations 
historically  revenues and casino patronage in the colorado casino operations are highest in the summer months and those months unaffected by inclement weather 
we expect this trend to continue 
revenues from route operations were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from million for the fiscal year ended june  machines on route increased machines or to machines at june  from machines at june  average machines on route during fiscal increased average machines or to average machines from average machines during fiscal the increase in route revenue was due to the increased number of machines on route offset somewhat by increased competition due to expansion of grocery store chains and local casino operations 
as a result of the increased competition  the trend of generally flat year over year route revenue comparisons is expected to continue

the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that the study s results will have on its route operation s revenues and profits 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal costs and expenses of proprietary games operations were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  proprietary games costs and expenses as a percentage of proprietary games revenues decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year the increase in proprietary games costs and expenses was due to increased machine parts  production and service payroll  shipping and handling  and production supplies  resulting primarily from increased machine conversions and maintenance 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased costs and expenses relating to the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike 
the decrease in proprietary games costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to equity in the income of the joint venture with igt  which  for accounting purposes  is recorded net of expenses 
additionally  revenues from the company s proprietary games  such as wheel of gold and totem pole  incur less costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue than the company s silver strike game  which previously accounted for a larger percentage of the company s proprietary games revenue 
developments in world silver markets during the past year have resulted in increased volatility in silver prices  which  if it persists  could affect the profitability of the silver strike game

recently adopted accounting standards the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this standard provides guidance on the financial reporting for start up costs and organization costs 
this standard requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged 
management believes that this standard could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements depending on the status of the company s current and future expansion projects at the time this standard is adopted 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
this statement requires companies to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe this new standard will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
this statement establishes additional standards for segment reporting in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes the segment information required to be disclosed under sfas will be more comprehensive than previously provided  including expanded disclosure of income statement and balance sheet items for each of its reportable segments under sfas year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this is generally referred to as the year problem 
if this situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer and other systems deemed to be date sensitive as well as those of its unconsolidated affiliates to assess its exposure to the year problem 
the company is already in the process of modifying or replacing those systems that are not year compliant 
based upon the comprehensive review  management believes that the company s systems are compliant or will be compliant by mid however  if modifications are not made or not completed within an adequate time frame  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
in addition  the company has communicated with its major vendors and suppliers to determine their state of readiness relative to the year problem and the company s exposure to third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that representations made to the company by third parties are in fact accurate 
as a result  the failure of a major vendor or supplier to adequately address their year problem could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
all costs related to the company s year problem are being expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware or software  is being capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
the costs associated with year compliance have not been and are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
specifically  as of june   the company has spent less than  and anticipates spending less than  thereafter 
these costs and estimated completion dates are based upon management s best estimates  as well as third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from these plans 
the company does not have a contingency plan relative to the year problem  although it intends to develop one before june
