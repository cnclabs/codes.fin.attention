item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data  included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference  include but are not limited to  credit quality  economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct our operations  fluctuations in interest rates and government regulation 
for additional information concerning these factors  see item business business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and stock price 
overview in pursuit of our business strategy  since we have expanded our financing business by i offering consumer financing through additional installment credit stores opened by banner  ii increasing the number and type of products and services financed  and iii offering new financial products and services 
in  we began offering i small unsecured loans generally ranging from to  with average loan terms of months  and ii installment credit finance to banner s customers at three additional installment credit stores in the greater los angeles area and one additional installment credit store in san francisco that banner opened or acquired in in  we opened two finance centers offering small loans and travel finance and one automobile sales location in the greater los angeles area  and began offering consumer product finance to banner s customers at one additional installment credit store in the greater los angeles area that banner opened in in  we also began offering financing for the sale of used automobiles  which was discontinued in may beginning in late  we expanded our indirect consumer financing business by offering financing to consumers for the purchase of products and services sold by independent retailers 
at present  we have retail installment financing arrangements with approximately independent retailers in the greater los angeles area 
in  we expanded our travel business by acquiring travel locations in june and locations in december 
we presently have travel locations  of which are located in california 
in addition  we began our automobile insurance business in through locations in the greater los angeles area and also began offering insurance premium financing to our customers 
in may  we introduced the efectiva card 
the efectiva card provides our customers with the ability to access their established lines of credit with us by withdrawing cash from our cash dispensing machines 
initially we installed our cash dispensing machines in locations owned or leased by the company or banner and two locations owned or leased by unaffiliated parties 
in october  we installed our cash dispensing machines at k mart locations in southern california 
in addition  in january  we and k mart agreed to expand the relationship and install cash dispensing machines in an additional k mart stores 
we expect these additional cash dispensing machines to be installed by march  further  we are talking to k mart about expanding to additional stores after march  and expanding the services we offer at these locations to include travel services 
during  we will concentrate on expanding our efectiva card program with other major retailers 
we believe this is a more efficient way to distribute our products and services than through purchasing consumer finance receivables that banner and other independent retailers generate 
as a result  we have determined to phase out our relationship with the smaller independent retailers 
as a result of the changes in products and services offered and changes in distribution channels  results of operations are not readily comparable from year to year or from period to period  and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results

the provision for credit losses in the small loan and independent retail finance portfolios is made following the origination of the loans over the period that the events giving rise to the credit losses are estimated to occur 
our portfolios comprise smaller balance  homogeneous loans that are evaluated collectively to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolios 
we pursue collection of past due accounts  and when the characteristics of an individual account indicates that collection is unlikely  the account is charged off and turned over to a collection agency 
accounts are generally charged off when they are between and days past due 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
our management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolios  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and current economic conditions 
for information concerning our provisions for credit losses and chargeoff experience in the consumer product and small loan portfolios  our two largest portfolios  see financial trends portfolios above

in  delinquencies and net write offs in the consumer product portfolio increased to levels which were substantially higher than those we have historically experienced in such portfolio 
these trends have continued during the increases occurred primarily with respect to our existing customers  rather than new credit customers 
we believe these increases were a result of excessive credit burdens for some customers  due to an aggregate overextension of credit in the marketplace  coupled with uncertainty over proposed legislative reforms potentially impacting our customers and their extended families 
in late we took a number of steps to improve collections and credit quality 
we hired two senior executives in the credit and collections fields 
in december  we installed an autodialer to assist our collections personnel in successfully contacting past due borrowers 
finally  we have hired ccn  inc to develop a proprietary credit scoring system for us  which we expect to implement during notwithstanding these measures  we cannot assure that the trend in increased delinquencies and net write offs will not continue 
the financing agreement among us  banner and holdings permits us to return to banner during each of and up to million of contracts purchased from or contributed by banner 
as a result of increasing delinquencies in the consumer product portfolio  the company and banner amended the financing agreement  to permit us for the year ended december  to return more than million of contracts purchased or contributed by banner and for banner to have up to months to reimburse the company for amounts transferred to banner

liquidity and capital resources we primarily finance our operations through the cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our lines of credit 
in june  we completed an initial public offering and prior to that we received periodic contributions to capital by holdings and related entities 
net cash provided from operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during these periods  the primary source of net cash provided from operations was net income before non cash charges  principally the provision for credit losses

to fund our expenditures and support the growth in our combined receivables portfolio  we relied on capital contributions from holdings  the proceeds from the initial public offering and bank borrowings made under our credit facilities 
prior to the initial public offering  we made a return of capital of  to banner 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were million during bank borrowings provided cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital contributions amounted to million in the year ended december  we require substantial capital to finance our business 
consequently  our ability to maintain our current level of operations and to expand our operations will be affected by the availability of financing and the terms thereof 
currently  we fund financing activities and operations with borrowings under the line of credit which expires june  holdings and all of our significant domestic subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
in addition  we have pledged substantially all of our assets  including our receivables  and the stock of all of our significant subsidiaries as collateral for the amounts we borrow under the line of credit 
the maximum amount available under the line of credit is million 
however  the amount of credit available at any one time under the line of credit is limited to of eligible contracts 
credit facilities are typically limited to a certain percentage of such eligible contracts or receivables 
as of december   the total amount available to us under the line of credit was million  of which approximately million was outstanding  including letters of credit 
we pay commitment fees to the lenders for the unused portion of the line of credit 
these commitment fees are equal to basis points per year times the average daily amount by which the maximum amount available under the line of credit exceeds the amount we have borrowed under the line 
interest on amounts outstanding under the line of credit is  at the option of central  equal to either a basis points above the higher of the prime rate wells fargo bank announces or the federal funds rate plus basis points or b basis points above the interest rate per annum at which wells fargo bank offers deposits in dollars to prime banks in the london eurodollar market 
the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under the line of credit at december  bore interest at the rate of 
we are required to maintain interest rate hedging arrangements for at least of our senior funded debt as defined in the line of credit 
however  this percentage may be reduced by the amount expressed as a percentage of the ratio of any permitted fixed rate indebtedness issued by central to the total senior funded debt as defined in the line of credit 
we have a hedge on million as of december  this hedging agreement is for the period july  through july  at a cost of  the line of credit restricts  among other things  our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay indebtedness prior to the date when due  iii pay dividends  make certain other restricted payments or consummate certain asset sales  iv merge or consolidate with any other person  v enter into certain transactions with affiliates  vi incur indebtedness that is subordinate in priority and right of payment to amounts outstanding under the line of credit  and vii make future acquisitions in excess of an aggregate amount 
the line of credit also contains certain restrictive covenants that require  among other things  us to maintain specific financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests 
these include a past due receivables ratio as defined in the line of credit as of the end of each month of no more than to  b credit loss allowance ratio as defined in the line of credit as of the end of each month of not less than to  c interest coverage ratio as defined in the line of credit as of the end of each quarter of not less than to  d credit loss net chargeoff percentage as defined in the line of credit as of the end of each month of not less than the minimum credit loss chargeoff percentage as defined in the line of credit as of such date  e leverage ratio as defined in the line of credit as of the end of each quarter of no more than to

the breach of any of these covenants or other terms of the line of credit could result in a default under the line of credit  in which event the lenders could seek to declare all amounts outstanding under the line of credit  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable 
at december   we did not comply with certain of the financial ratios and tests 
these defaults were waived by the lending group 
in addition  our inability at any time to renew or replace our line of credit or other senior credit facilities on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
see item business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and stock price restrictions imposed by the line of credit  and need for senior credit facility 
in february  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mission savings and loan association  a federally chartered savings association based in riverside  california the bank 
the cost of the acquisition will equal times the bank s adjusted stockholders equity at the end of the month immediately prior to the date of acquisition 
this amount is currently estimated to be approximately million 
the acquisition is subject to  among other things  the approval of the ots and the approval of the shareholders of the bank 
at december   the bank had approximately million in total assets and million in total stockholders equity 
the bank had net income of million during we expect to have sufficient cash on hand or available under our line of credit to consummate the acquisition 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards number earnings per share sfas  statement of financial accounting standards number reporting comprehensive income sfas and statement of financial accounting standards number disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
we have adopted sfas  for the year ended december  the adoption of sfas  did not have a material effect on our financial position or our results of operations in we will adopt sfas and sfas in and believe the adoption of those statements will not have a material effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
our computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have engaged an outside consulting firm to convert our computer systems to be year compliant so that they will recognize the difference between dates using and as one year instead of negative years 
testing and conversion of system applications is expected to cost  and is expected to be completed by december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
