item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in recent years  the company made the strategic decision to leverage its strength as a low cost  value added mro provider by adding new categories of mro supplies  such as welding and electrical supplies  which has increased sales to existing customers and allowed the company access to new customers 
the company believes that revenue has increased  in part  as a result of the increase in the number of skus  however  the company is unable to quantify precisely the impact of such increase 
the company intends to continue to add new product categories and increase the number of products offered in existing product categories in its efforts to gain new customers and increase sales from existing customers 
during fiscal  the company added approximately  skus and expects to add approximately  skus during each of the next two fiscal years 
the company generally adds skus in response to the feedback it receives from its existing customers 
in this way  the company seeks to increase purchases from existing customers through increased product offerings that it knows are desired by its customers 
the company also seeks to expand its customer base by offering its increased product lines and product offerings to customers who have not previously purchased merchandise from the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase the number of skus offered or that the correlation between the number of skus offered and revenue will continue 
the company significantly expanded its direct mail marketing program from approximately million pieces in fiscal to million pieces in fiscal in fiscal  the company targeted its marketing program to enhance its investments in acquired entities and new distribution centers 
accordingly  in fiscal  mailings increased to million pieces 
targeted mailings to customers or potential customers are designed to maximize the company s return in relation to its marketing expenditures 
the company utilizes its customer databases to match specific customer profiles with an expanding selection of catalog titles which emphasize specific product categories 
the company believes that increasing mailings to more targeted customer segments has resulted in increased marketing productivity 
in fiscal  the company intends to take advantage of the additional products offered and its expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing its direct marketing efforts 
these direct marketing expenditures are expected to enhance the expanded product offerings and improved distribution capabilities  however  the costs associated with this program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of the company s direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers 
revenue per employee increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  during fiscal the company believes that this increase in revenue per employee is indicative of its efforts to achieve higher levels of efficiency and cost savings at the employee level 
the number of annual orders entered and processed has increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million during fiscal the average order size of the company s core business has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately during fiscal the company believes that its targeted marketing campaign strategy  its strategy of continuing to add new product categories and new products within existing categories  and increased efficiencies in order processing have been significant contributing factors to the company s increase in orders and  accordingly  sales  both from existing customers and from new customers 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to grow at rates recently experienced or at all 
msc commenced shipping operations at its distribution center in harrisburg  pennsylvania during fiscal in order to improve the company s efficiency  geographic distribution and market penetration

diluted 







the company has generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months and the company expects this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of the company s fixed costs during slower sales periods 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of commencement of operations at new distribution centers 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by its sales growth  acquisitions and facilities expansions 
the company s primary sources of financing have been cash from operations  supplemented by bank borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility the credit facility  and a portion of the proceeds from the company s public offering completed at the end of fiscal the second offering 
the company anticipates that the proceeds from these offerings  its cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be adequate to support its operations for the immediate future and for at least the next months 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company has available unsecured borrowings of up to million 
interest on amounts borrowed may be paid at the option of the company at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate at august  or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum 
the credit facility contains certain covenants limiting mergers  use of proceeds  indebtedness  liens  investments  sale of assets and acquisitions 
the credit facility also contains certain financial covenants which require the company to maintain a minimum net worth  ratio of current assets to current liabilities  ratio of liabilities to effective net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio and positive net income  to refrain from capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts and to limit the issuance of dividends 
as of august   the company was in compliance with all bank covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash from operations resulted from higher net income  offset in part by higher net working capital requirements 
additionally  in fiscal  inventory excluding inventory of acquired companies declined  reflecting improved inventory control policies and procedures 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase of million is primarily attributable to less cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal than for those in fiscal  offset by the purchase of a building in long island  new york which will begin serving as the new corporate headquarters in fiscal the remaining cash used in investing activities in fiscal was for expenditures related to the construction of a new distribution center 
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal years ended august  and august  was approximately  and million  respectively 
the change of million is primarily attributable to the difference between the proceeds received from the completion of the company s second offering  net of the repayment of existing long term debt from such proceeds in fiscal during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately  shares of its class a common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  subsequent to august  and through october   the company has purchased an additional  shares of class a common stock for  all shares of class a common stock acquired are being retained in the company s treasury and reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options granted under the company s stock option plan and stock option plan 
disclosures about market risks 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material market risk exposures 
year compliance plan year problem 
the year problem arises from the historic use of only two digits rather than four for the designation of a year in date information within computer programs 
if not corrected  any of the company s equipment or software programs that perform time sensitive calculations may incorrectly identify the year as instead of this could result in miscalculations or a major failure of certain systems 
msc may also be vulnerable to the year problems of its customers  suppliers and service vendors and of other companies with which msc conducts business eg  utility companies  shippers and telecommunications companies 
state of readiness 
during calendar year  msc developed and began to implement a year compliance plan using internal and external resources in an effort to ensure that its business is not interrupted by the year problem 
msc s year compliance plan is broken into four components renovating internal systems and applications 
the company s internal systems and applications include order entry  purchasing and warehouse management 
the applications used in the order entry system have been re written and are being phased into the company s call center and branch locations 
this process is expected to be completed by may the applications for the purchasing and warehouse management systems are in the process of being modified and completion of year compliance work is scheduled for march many of the company s applications are already year compliant as they were written using a compliant code generator 
ensuring compliance of peripheral third party systems 
msc uses a number of third party package systems to supplement its internally developed programs 
major systems in this area are its financial and inventory replenishment systems 
the company s financial systems are being replaced with a new package  with a scheduled implementation date of may two of msc s subsidiaries  enco and primeline  are already running on this software 
the inventory replenishment system has been tested and appears to be year compliant 
all of the company s material hardware  including its as computers  telephone systems  networks  pcs  security systems and time clocks at all msc locations have been tested as year compliant 
ensuring year compliance by external companies that conduct business with the company 
the company has contacted all of its major customers  suppliers and vendors to inquire about year compliance 
the company has not received responses from all those contacted  but those who have responded do not indicate any problems at this time 
for those business partners with which the company currently conducts business electronically  the company will be conducting tests to determine year compliance in implementing standards and conducting testing in an effort to ensure that the company s existing and future systems are year compliant 
all new systems  whether hardware or software  are tested before implementation in an effort to ensure year compliance 
cost of compliance 
msc believes that the total cost of its year compliance plan will be  not including the replacement of the financial system 
these costs are expensed as incurred and  to date  the company has incurred  of such expenses 
the financial systems replacement is a separate project which is estimated to cost approximately  and will be capitalized 
risks 
although msc believes it will have its own systems compliant prior to january   there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so nor can there be any assurance that  even if the company completes timely its year compliance plan  the systems  when actually implemented in full  will work properly independently or in conjunction with the systems of any business partner 
in addition  the company would continue to bear the risk of a material adverse affect if any of its business partners does not appropriately address its own year compliance issues 
although msc believes that its major customers are year compliant  the company is still in the process of reviewing the compliance programs of suppliers and service vendors 
msc s current estimates of the impact of the year problem on its operations and financial results do not include costs and time that may be incurred as a result of other companies failure to become year compliant on a timely basis  which costs could be material 
there can be no assurance that such other companies will achieve year compliance or that any conversions by such companies to become year compliant will be compatible with msc s computer systems 
the inability of msc or any of its principal suppliers  service vendors or customers to become year compliant in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on msc s financial condition or results of operation 
contingency plans 
if msc s suppliers are not year compliant  msc may have to arrange for alternative sources of supply and the stockpiling of inventory in the fall of in preparation for the year the company cannot estimate at this time the cost or effect on the company s financial condition of any stockpiling of inventory 
the company does not have any other contingency plans with respect to other problems that could arise in its business as a result of the year problem 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on msc s financial condition or results of operation 
the foregoing contains forward looking statements and there can be no assurance due to changes in local  regional or national economies and the availability of acquisition opportunities  among other things  that the foregoing shall be the case
