igc has historically met its liquidity requirements principally from cash flow generated from home and land sales  property management fees  distributions from residential rental partnerships and from bank financing providing funds for development and working capital 
over the past several years  igc s cash flows have been constrained because of the terms of its existing debt agreements and the reluctance of lenders to provide financing in the us as a result of the wetlands litigation see item legal proceedings 
as a result  substantially all of the cash generated has been used to pay debt service requirements with existing lenders 
this resulted in limited opportunities for new construction and development in the us 
the recently closed banc one financing provided funding to commence construction in fairway village  the third village in st 
charles  and will allow igc to retain a greater portion of its us land sales proceeds 
igc currently has other development projects in various stages of completion 
substantially all of the projects under construction have sufficient development loans in place to complete the construction 
igc s principal demands for liquidity are expected to be the continued funding of its current debt service and operating costs  including potential ongoing legal costs for the wetlands litigation as well as capital for its waste technology investments 
after the restructuring  management expects to obtain additional funding which can be used by acpt to fund new community development projects 
such sources of funding may include  but are not limited to  excess operating cash flows  secured or unsecured financings  private or public offerings of debt or equity securities and proceeds from sales of properties 
igc s anticipated cash provided by operations  new and existing financing facilities  and extension or refinancing of  of loans that are due in are expected to satisfy the company s capital needs in however  there are no assurances that these funds will be generated

year igc has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications and other systems using computer chips currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause the systems to process critical financial and operations information incorrectly 
igc s reporting systems are year compliant with the exception of one module 
the company has engaged a programmer at a nominal cost to bring this module into compliance 
management is continuing to review the remaining operating systems and computer systems that affect the properties the company manages
