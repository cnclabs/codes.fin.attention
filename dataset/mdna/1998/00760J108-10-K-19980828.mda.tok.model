item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis section and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in business 
the forward looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements or to update reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview the company was founded in to develop and manufacture burn in and test equipment for the semiconductor industry 
since its inception  the company has sold more than  systems to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide 
the company s principal products currently are the mtx massively parallel test system  the max and atx burn in systems  the diepak carrier and test fixtures 
prior to fiscal  the company primarily sold burn in systems and related products 
the company experienced significant operating losses in fiscal through fiscal due to a decline in net sales of burn in systems and significant investment in the development of new products 
in fiscal  the company initiated development of the mtx massively parallel test system and the diepak carrier 
the company began shipping the mtx in march and diepak carriers in fiscal in  the company entered into a cost sharing agreement with darpa  a us government agency  under which darpa is providing co funding for the development of wafer level burn in and test equipment 
the contract provides for potential payments by darpa totaling up to million 
the agreement provides that i the company shall retain title to all co funded inventions  ii darpa will receive a paid up license to use the inventions for government purposes and iii darpa can require the company to license the inventions to third parties on reasonable terms if the company fails to adequately commercialize the inventions 
payments by darpa depend on satisfaction of development milestones  and darpa has the right to terminate project funding at any time 
the level of payments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet the development milestones or that darpa will continue funding the project 
darpa payments are reflected as credits to research and development expenses 
there also can be no assurance that the development project will result in any marketable products 
the company has completed certain development milestones and invoiced million through may  the remaining funding is subject to milestones scheduled to be completed through january  although the company expects that completion of certain milestones will be delayed beyond that date 
the company has a wholly owned subsidiary in germany which performs sales and service and a owned subsidiary in japan  which performs sales  service and limited product engineering and manufacturing 
the company s consolidated financial statements combine the subsidiaries financial results with those of the company but  in order to account for the minority shareholders interest in the japanese subsidiary  the financial statements include a line item which excludes of the total profits or losses of the japanese subsidiary  except for periods in which the subsidiary has cumulative losses in which case no such exclusions are made 
the company s net sales consist primarily of sales of systems  die carriers  test fixtures  upgrades and spare parts and revenues from service contracts 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and records a provision for estimated future warranty costs 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales are derived from the sale of products for overseas markets  particularly germany and japan 
consequently  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of the company s products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets 
although most sales to german customers are denominated in dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
the exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent the company s japanese subsidiary incurs yen denominated expenses 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks  but it may do so in the future 
the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt owed to the company and denominated in dollars 
since its financial statements are based in yen  the japanese subsidiary recognizes an income or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the dollar 
in accordance with sfas  the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
capitalized costs  net of accumulated amortization  of approximately  and  were included as of may  and  respectively 
system software development costs were fully amortized as of may  results of operations the following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

net sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended may  from million in the fiscal year ended may   a decrease of 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in net sales in the company s subsidiary in japan  and reduced shipment of traditional burn in products 
the company anticipates that net sales will decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit

the company s japanese subsidiary experienced significant cumulative losses since fiscal  and thus generated certain net operating losses available to offset future taxes payable 
as a result of the subsidiary s cumulative operating losses  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the subsidiary s net deferred tax assets 
the company recorded tax benefits totaling million in fiscal related to recognition of its united states net deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended may  more closely approximates normal operations  although it is higher than the statutory us rate because no tax benefit is recorded for losses in the company s japanese subsidiary 
the company anticipates that the japanese subsidiary will record a loss in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the growth in net sales was caused primarily by increased shipments of mtx products  primarily to siemens  and to a lesser extent by increased shipments of diepak carriers 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in unit sales of burn in systems  particularly in the japanese market 
siemens accounted for and of net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from a change in the product mix toward products with somewhat higher material costs and increases in provision for inventory reserves  scrap  and other miscellaneous costs of sales  partially offset by improvement in production efficiencies due to higher levels of production

income tax expense consisted primarily of the minimum federal and state taxes in the us  as operating loss carryforwards offset other taxable income  and taxes on earnings of the company s german subsidiary 
income tax benefit was  in fiscal compared with income tax expense of  in fiscal the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s japanese subsidiary experienced significant cumulative losses since fiscal  and thus generated certain net operating losses available to offset future taxes payable 
as a result of the subsidiary s cumulative operating losses  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the subsidiary s net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded tax benefits totaling million in fiscal related to recognition of its united states net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been the cash flow generated from the company s august initial public offering  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
as of may   the company had million in cash and short term investments 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the fiscal year ended may  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended may  for the fiscal year ended may   net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in inventories of million  partially offset by net income of million 
for the fiscal year ended may   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by an increase in inventory of million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended may  and  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the short term and long term investments made with proceeds from the company s initial public offering in august financing activities provided cash of approximately million in the fiscal year ended may  and used cash of approximately million in the fiscal year ended may  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the company s initial public offering 
as of may   the company had working capital of million  compared with million as of may  working capital consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets  less current liabilities 
the increase in working capital as of may  was primarily due to the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
the company announced in august that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common shares 
the company will repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  from time to time  subject to market conditions 
the number of shares of common stock actually acquired by the company will depend on subsequent developments and corporate needs  and the repurchase program may be interrupted or discontinued at any time 
any such repurchase of shares  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement the company s business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital or require the issuance of equity 
the company has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 
the company anticipates that the existing cash balance together with cash provided by operations  if any  are adequate to meet its working capital and capital equipment requirements through fiscal after fiscal  depending on its rate of growth and profitability  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to meet its working capital requirements or capital equipment needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required  or if available  that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes requirements for disclosure of comprehensive income and becomes effective for the company for the year ending may  comprehensive income includes such items as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities that are currently being presented by the company as a component of shareholders equity 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to materially impact the company s results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments for a business enterprise 
the new standard becomes effective for the company for the year ending may   and requires that comparative information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of this standard 
the company does not expect this pronouncement to materially change the company s current reporting and disclosures 
factors that may affect future results of operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of  as amended and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s future results of operations could vary significantly from the results anticipated by such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth as follows and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results 
during fiscal and  quarterly net sales have been as low as  and as high as  and gross margins for quarterly sales have fluctuated between and 
the company s future operating results will depend upon a variety of factors  including the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors  customers or suppliers  the length of sales cycles for the company s products  timing of new product announcements and releases by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s products  capital spending patterns by customers  timing of completion and approval of darpa development milestones  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with new product introductions by the company  the company s ability to produce systems and products in volume and meet customer requirements  product returns and customer acceptance of product shipments  volatility in the company s targeted markets  political and economic instability  natural disasters  regulatory changes  possible disruptions caused by expanding existing facilities or moving into new facilities  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  and various competitive factors  including price based competition and competition from vendors employing other technologies 
the company s gross margins have varied and will continue to vary based on a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  sales volume  and the amount of products sold under volume purchase arrangements  which tend to have lower selling prices 
accordingly  past performance may not be indicative of future performance 
dependence on timing and size of sales orders and shipment 
during the company s last two fiscal years  net sales in the first fiscal quarter  ended august  have declined compared with the fourth fiscal quarter  ended may  of the preceding fiscal year 
the company expects that fluctuations of this type may occur in the future 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems which typically range in purchase price from approximately  to over million 
as a result  the loss or deferral of a limited number of system sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales and operating results in a particular period 
all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalties  and  therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
from time to time  cancellations and reschedulings of customer orders have occurred  and delays by the company s suppliers in providing components or subassemblies to the company have caused delays in the company s shipments of its own products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and reschedulings 
a substantial portion of net sales typically are realized near the end of each quarter 
a delay or reduction in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated shipment reschedulings  cancellations or deferrals by customers  customer credit issues  unexpected manufacturing difficulties experienced by the company  or delays in deliveries by suppliers  could cause net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below the company s expectations 
as the company incurs expenses in anticipation of future sales levels  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if such sales levels are not achieved 
recent operating losses 
the company incurred operating losses of  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the company has operated profitably during fiscal  and  increased net sales in those years were substantially the result of sales of new products  particularly sales of mtx systems to siemens 
during fiscal  and  siemens accounted for  and of the company s net sales  respectively 
sales to siemens  which include both the mtx and other products  are made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
there is no long term volume purchase commitment 
in fiscal  the company began to feel the industry slowdown due to uncertainties caused primarily by the financial crisis in asia and dram overcapacity 
there can be no assurance that the industry will rebound soon or that the company will be able to return to profitability soon if it incurs net operating losses 
dependence on market acceptance of mtx system 
a principal element of the company s strategy is to capture an increasing share of the memory test equipment market through sales of the mtx massively parallel test system 
the mtx is a new system designed to perform both burn in and many of the final test functions currently performed by high cost memory testers and the market for mtx systems is in the early stage of development 
the company s strategy depends  in part  upon its ability to persuade potential customers that the mtx system can successfully perform a significant portion of such final test functions and that transferring such tests to mtx systems will reduce their overall capital and test costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will be successful 
the failure of the mtx system to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
market acceptance of the mtx system is subject to a number of risks 
to date  several companies have purchased evaluation units of the mtx systems  however  only siemens has purchased production quantities 
sales to siemens  which include both the mtx and other products  are made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
there is no long term volume purchase commitment 
although siemens has taken delivery of production quantities of mtx systems and has used the mtx to perform a number of test functions previously performed by memory testers  the company believes siemens has not yet completed the evaluations necessary for it to transfer additional test functions from standard testers to mtx systems 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the mtx system will be accepted by companies other than siemens for performing memory test functions in volume production 
future sales to siemens and other customers could be adversely affected if for any reason siemens does not satisfy itself that additional test functions can successfully be transferred to the mtx system 
since most potential customers have successfully relied on memory testers for many years and their personnel understand the use and maintenance of such systems  the company anticipates that they may be reluctant to change their procedures in order to transfer test functions to the mtx system 
before a customer will transfer test functions to the mtx  the test programs must be translated for use with the mtx and lengthy correlation tests must be performed 
correlation testing may take up to six months or more 
furthermore  mtx system sales are expected to be primarily limited to new facilities and to existing facilities being upgraded to accommodate new product generations  such as the transition from mb to mb drams 
construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during this semiconductor industry downturn 
other companies have purchased mtx systems which are being used in quality assurance and engineering applications  and the company believes that some of these companies are evaluating the mtx for use in production applications 
market acceptance of the mtx system also may be affected by a reluctance of ic manufacturers to rely on relatively small suppliers such as the company 
as is common with new complex and software intensive products  the company encountered reliability  design and manufacturing issues as it began volume production and initial installations of mtx systems at customer sites 
the company places a high priority on addressing these issues as they arise 
certain of these issues have been related to components and subsystems supplied to the company by third parties which have in some cases limited the ability of the company to address such issues promptly 
one customer who purchased an mtx system in for use in a quality assurance application subsequently determined that the mtx system did not meet its particular requirements  the company purchased the system from that customer at a reduced price and intends to refurbish the system for resale 
since the company is still in the early stages of the mtx systems life cycle  there can be no assurance that other reliability  design and manufacturing issues will not be discovered in the future or that such issues  if they arise  can be resolved to the customers satisfaction or that the resolution of such problems will not cause the company to incur significant development costs or warranty expenses or to lose significant sales opportunities 
the company s future sales and operating results are also partially dependent on its sales of performance test boards for use with the mtx system 
sales of ptbs by the company and its licensees will depend upon the number of mtx systems installed by customers 
dependence on development of bare die market and market acceptance of diepak carrier 
another element of the company s strategy is to capture an increasing share of the bare die burn in and test product market through sales of its diepak carrier products 
the company developed the diepak carrier to enable burn in and test of bare die in order to supply known good die kgd for use in applications such as multichip modules 
the company s diepak strategy depends upon increased industry acceptance of bare die as an alternative to packaged die as well as acceptance of the company s diepak products 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will be successful 
the market for carriers to produce kgd has not expanded as rapidly as expected  as some customers are adopting chip scale packages csps  which are smaller than traditional packages  as their next packaging strategy 
even though csps are relatively expensive  the company believes that end users are expressing a preference for csps because they believe that csps are more compatible with their existing pc board assembly equipment this has delayed the growth of the market for kgd  and therefore for the company s diepak carrier 
the failure of the bare die market to expand or of the diepak carrier to achieve broad market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the emergence of the bare die market and broad acceptance of the diepak carrier are subject to a number of risks 
the company believes that the growth of the bare die market depends largely on the relative cost and benefits to the manufacturers of pcs and other electronics products of using bare die rather than alternative ic packaging methods 
there can be no assurance that electronics manufacturers will perceive that the benefits of kgd justify its potentially higher cost  and acceptance of kgd for many applications may therefore be limited 
in addition  electronics manufacturers must change their manufacturing processes in order to use kgd  but electronics manufacturers typically have substantial investments in existing manufacturing technology and have historically been slow in transitioning to new technologies 
the adoption of the diepak products by ic manufacturers and burn in and test services companies typically will involve a lengthy qualification 
such qualification processes have delayed high volume sales of diepak products by the company 
motorola is the only customer to have ordered diepak products in production quantities 
motorola accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales of diepak products in fiscal and  respectively 
sales to motorola  which include both diepak products and other products  are made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
there is no long term volume purchase commitment 
there can be no assurance that the bare die market will emerge and grow as the company anticipates  that the diepak carrier will achieve commercial acceptance  or that the company will not experience difficulties in ramping up production to meet any increased demand for diepak products that may develop 
customer concentration 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and contract assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor equipment 
sales to the company s five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of its net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  siemens accounted for  and of the company s net sales  respectively 
during fiscal  motorola  inc accounted for of net sales 
no other customers represented more than of the company s net sales for any of such periods 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
in addition  sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from a significant customer  or a delay in collecting or failure to collect accounts receivable from a significant customer could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
limited market for burn in systems 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s net sales were derived from the sale of burn in systems 
the market for burn in systems is mature and estimated to be less than million per year 
in general  process control improvements in the semiconductor industry have tended to reduce burn in times 
in addition  as a given ic product generation matures and yields increase  the required burn in time may be reduced or eliminated 
some burn in system suppliers primarily provide monitored burn in systems optimized for drams 
the sale of monitored burn in products has reduced the size of the market segment addressed by the company s dynamic burn in systems 
ic manufacturers  the company s primary historical customer base  increasingly outsource test and burn in to independent test labs  who often build their own systems 
there can be no assurance that the market for burn in systems will grow  and sales of the company s burn in products could decline 
lengthy sales cycle 
sales of the company s systems depend  in significant part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or to restructure current manufacturing facilities  either of which typically involve a significant commitment of capital 
in view of the significant investment or strategic issues that may be involved in a decision to purchase mtx systems or diepak carriers  the company may experience delays following initial qualification of the company s systems as a result of delays in a customer s approval process 
furthermore  the approval process for mtx and diepak carrier sales may require lengthy qualification and correlation testing 
for this and other reasons  the company s systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which the company may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale 
lengthy sales cycles subject the company to a number of significant risks  including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results  over which the company has little or no control 
the loss of individual orders due to the lengthy sales and evaluation cycle  or delays in the sale of even a limited number of systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition and  in particular  could contribute to significant fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly basis 
dependence on international sales and operations 
approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively  were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states 
the company maintains a sales  service  product engineering and manufacturing organization in japan  and a sales and service organization in germany 
the company expects sales of products for delivery outside of the united states will continue to represent a substantial portion of its future revenues 
the future performance of the company will depend  in significant part  upon its ability to continue to compete in foreign markets which in turn will depend  in part  upon a continuation of current trade relations between the united states and foreign countries in which semiconductor manufacturers or assemblers have operations 
a change toward more protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or such foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets 
in addition  the company is subject to other risks associated with doing business internationally  including longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  risks of civil disturbance or other events which may limit or disrupt markets  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are in asia 
recent turmoil in the asian financial markets has resulted in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
in addition  dram prices have fallen dramatically and may continue to do so as some asian ic manufacturers may be selling drams at or near cost in order to raise cash 
these developments may affect the company in several ways 
currency devaluations may make dollar denominated goods such as the company s more expensive for asian clients 
the company believes that asian manufacturers are limiting capital spending including the purchase of mtxs  and that the uncertainty of the dram market is causing most manufacturers worldwide to delay capital spending plans 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of the company s customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
in addition  some portion of fab construction has been subsidized by asian governments 
financial turmoil may reduce these governments willingness to continue such subsidies 
such developments could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because a substantial portion of the company s net sales is from sales of products for delivery outside the united states  including particularly germany and japan  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of the company s products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets 
approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal were denominated in us dollars  japanese yen and german marks  respectively 
although most sales to german customers are denominated in dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in japanese yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent the company s japanese subsidiary incurs yen denominated expenses 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt owed to the company and denominated in dollars 
since the subsidiary s financial statements are based in yen  it recognizes an income gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the dollar 
in fiscal  and  the company experienced foreign currency losses of   and  respectively 
a substantial portion of the world s manufacturers of memory devices are in korea  japan and taiwan and growth in the company s net sales depends in large part upon its ability to penetrate the korean and japanese markets 
both the korean and japanese markets are difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
the company has served the japanese market through its japanese subsidiary  which has experienced limited success and incurred operating losses in recent years 
sales into korea have not been significant in recent years 
the company formerly served the korean market through a direct support operation  which was closed in the company is currently represented by a local distributor  but its sales into korea remain low 
the lack of local manufacturing may impede the company s efforts to develop the korean market 
taiwan also represents an increasingly important portion of the memory manufacturer market 
the company relies on an independent distributor in taiwan and does not have any direct operations in taiwan 
there can be no assurances that the company s efforts in japan  korea or taiwan will be successful or that the company will be able to achieve and sustain significant sales to  or be able to successfully compete in  the japanese  korean or taiwanese test and burn in markets 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to develop new products and to introduce these products at competitive prices and on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s success in developing new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both future demand and the technology that will be available to supply that demand 
furthermore  introductions of new and complex products typically involve a period in which design  engineering and reliability issues are identified and addressed by the company and its suppliers 
this process in the past has required and in the future is likely to require the company to incur unreimbursed engineering expenses  and from time to time to experience warranty claims or product returns 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products that satisfy market demand 
any such failure would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the complexity of the company s products  significant delays can occur between a product s introduction and the commencement of volume production of such product 
the company has experienced significant delays from time to time in the introduction of  and technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain of its products and may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new products  and there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter such difficulties in the future 
the company s inability to complete product development  products or to manufacture and ship products in volume and in time to meet customer requirements would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future improvements in semiconductor design and manufacturing technology may reduce or eliminate the need for the company s products 
for example  the introduction of viable wafer level burn in and test systems  improvements in built in self test bist technology  and improvements in conventional test systems  such as reduced cost or increased throughput  may significantly reduce or eliminate the market for one or more of the company s products 
uncertainties relating to darpa funding for research and development 
in  the company entered into a cost sharing agreement with darpa  a us government agency  under which darpa is providing co funding for the development of wafer level burn in and test equipment 
the contract provides for potential payments by darpa totaling up to million 
the agreement provides that i the company shall retain title to all co funded inventions  ii darpa will receive a paid up license to use the inventions for government purposes and iii darpa can require the company to license the inventions to third parties on reasonable terms if the company fails to adequately commercialize the inventions 
payments by darpa depend on satisfaction of development milestones  and darpa has the right to terminate project funding at any time 
the level of payments may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet the development milestones or that darpa will continue funding the project 
if darpa funding were discontinued and the company continued the project  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
there also can be no assurance that the development project will result in any marketable products 
the company has completed certain development milestones and invoiced million through may  the remaining funding is subject to milestones scheduled to be completed through january  although the company expects that completion of certain milestones will be delayed beyond that date 
intense competition 
in each of the markets it serves  the company faces competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
in addition  continuing consolidation in the semiconductor equipment industry  and potential future consolidation  could adversely affect the ability of smaller companies such as the company to compete with larger  integrated competitors 
new product introductions by the company s competitors or by new market entrants could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company believes that to remain competitive it must invest significant financial resources in new product development and expand its customer service and support worldwide 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price  technical capabilities  quality  flexibility  automation  cost of ownership  reliability  throughput  product availability and customer service 
in each of the markets it serves  the company faces competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
because the company s mtx system performs burn in and many of the functional tests performed by memory testers  the company expects that the mtx system will face intense competition from burn in system suppliers and traditional memory tester suppliers 
the market for burn in systems is highly fragmented  with many domestic and international suppliers 
some users  such as independent test labs  build their own burn in systems  and some other users  particularly large japanese ic manufacturers  acquire burn in systems from captive or affiliated suppliers 
competing suppliers of burn in and functional test systems include ando corporation  japan engineering company and reliability incorporated 
in addition  suppliers of memory test equipment including advantest corporation and teradyne  inc may seek to offer competitive parallel test systems in the future 
the company s max dynamic and atx monitored and dynamic burn in systems increasingly have faced and are expected to continue to face severe competition  especially from local  low cost manufacturers 
also  the max dynamic burn in system faces severe competition from manufacturers of monitored burn in systems that perform limited functional tests  including tests designed to ensure the devices receive the specified voltages and signals 
the company s diepak products face significant competition 
texas instruments incorporated sells a temporary  reusable bare die carrier which is intended to enable burn in and test of bare die  and the company believes that several other companies have developed or are developing other such products 
as the bare die market develops  the company expects that other competitors will emerge 
the company expects that the primary competitive factors in this market will be cost  performance  reliability and assured supply 
the company s test fixture products face numerous competitors 
there are limited barriers to entry into the bib market  and as a result  many small companies design and manufacture bibs  including bibs for use with the company s max and atx systems 
the company s strategy is to provide higher performance bibs  and the company generally does not compete to supply lower cost  low performance bibs 
the company has granted a royalty bearing license to one company to make ptbs for use with its mtx systems  in order to assure customers of a second source of supply  and the company may license others as well 
sales of ptbs by licensees would result in royalties to the company but would reduce the company s own sales of ptbs 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by the company s competitors or by new market entrants could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company believes that to remain competitive it must invest significant financial resources in new product development and expand its customer service and support worldwide 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
cyclicality of semiconductor industry and customer purchases  risk of cancellations and reschedulings 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in general  and the market for drams and other memories in particular  historically have been highly volatile and have experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns  which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor capital equipment  including test and burn in systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected the company s operating results in the past and in fiscal in addition  the purchasing patterns of the company s customers are also highly cyclical because most customers purchase the company s products for use in new production facilities or for upgrading existing test lines for the introduction of next generation products 
construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during this semiconductor industry downturn 
a large portion of the company s net sales are attributable to a few customers and therefore a reduction in purchases by one or more customers could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance that the semiconductor industry will grow in the future at the same rates it has grown historically 
any downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor industry would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the need to maintain investment in research and development and to maintain customer service and support will limit the company s ability to reduce its expenses in response to any such downturn or slowdown period 
the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry has historically been subject to a relatively high rate of purchase order cancellation by customers as compared to other high technology industry sectors 
manufacturing companies that are the customers of semiconductor equipment companies frequently revise  postpone and cancel capital facility expansion plans 
in such cases  semiconductor equipment companies may experience a significant rate of cancellations and reschedulings of purchase orders  as was the case in the industry in late and early  and as is the case in there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and reschedulings 
dependence on subcontractors  sole or limited sources of supply 
the company relies on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components or subassemblies used in its products 
the company s mtx  max and atx systems contain several components  including environmental chambers  power supplies and certain ics  which are currently supplied by only one or a limited number of suppliers 
the diepak products include an interconnect substrate which is supplied only by nitto denko corporation 
nitto denko and the company developed the interconnect substrate in cooperation with each other pursuant to a joint development agreement 
the company does not have formal written supply agreements with nitto denko 
while there have been no significant interruptions in supply of components by nitto denko  there can be no assurance that nitto denko will be able to respond to a high volume order within an acceptable timeframe 
the company s reliance on subcontractors and single source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including the loss of control over the manufacturing process  the potential absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractor or single source supplier were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture subassemblies  components or parts in required volumes  the company would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers could be lengthy  and no assurance can be given that any additional sources would be available to the company on a timely basis 
any delay  interruption or termination of a supplier relationship could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
management of changing business 
if the company is to be successful  it must expand its operations 
such expansion will place a significant strain on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources 
such expansion will result in a continuing increase in the responsibility placed upon management personnel and will require development or enhancement of operational  managerial and financial systems and controls 
if the company is unable to manage the expansion of its operations effectively  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of rhea posedel  its president and chief executive officer  as well as other executive officers and key employees 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance for its benefit on any of its personnel  and none of the company s employees is subject to a noncompetition agreement with the company 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or a group of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s future success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
there is a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it has become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
competition for such personnel in the semiconductor equipment industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the company s inability to attract and retain the executive management and other key personnel it requires could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property protection and infringement 
the company s ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology and information 
although the company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that these measures will be adequate or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
further  there can be no assurance that claims allowed on any patent issued to the company will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology  that any patent will issue from any pending application or that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property 
litigation may be necessary to enforce or determine the validity and scope of the company s proprietary rights  and there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property rights  if challenged  will be upheld as valid 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
there are no pending claims against the company regarding infringement of any patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
however  the company may receive  in the future  communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against the company 
such claims could include assertions that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  requests for indemnification against such infringement or suggestions that the company may be interested in acquiring a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any such claim made in the future will not result in litigation  which could involve significant expense to the company  and  if the company is required or deems it appropriate to obtain a license relating to one or more products or technologies  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the use  storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used in the company s operations 
the company believes that its activities conform in all material respects to current environmental and land use regulations applicable to its operations and its current facilities and that it has obtained environmental permits necessary to conduct its business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous or toxic substances could subject the company to significant liabilities 
possible volatility of stock price 
the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s operating results  failure to meet securities analysts expectations  general conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries and the worldwide economy  announcements of technological innovations  new systems or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  fluctuations in the level of cooperative development funding  acquisitions  changes in governmental regulations  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in the company s relationships with customers and suppliers could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for small capitalization and high technology stocks in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
year the company and its subsidiaries are taking action to provide that their computer systems are capable of processing for the period of year and beyond 
the costs associated with these actions are not expected to significantly affect operating cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s computer systems will be fully year compliant in a timely or cost effective manner  and a failure by the company to make its internal systems year compliant in a timely  cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
