item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in order to maximize shareholder value  the company continues to pursue a strategy of effectively utilizing the capital acquired in the bank s conversion and the company s initial public offering consummated in december the company believes that its effective utilization of capital is best achieved through the growth of the company s business 
pursuant to the company s post conversion strategic plan  this growth is to be achieved through the expansion of the company s asset base and diversification of the company s portfolio into higher yielding assets  and is to be implemented in two stages 
in stage one  implemented in fiscal through the first half of fiscal  management focused on achieving a target asset size for the company established by the board of directors 
in stage two  which commenced in the second half of fiscal and continued in fiscal  management focused  and intends to continue to focus  on portfolio diversification coupled with a moderate increase in the rate of growth of the company s asset base 
the company intends to continue its asset portfolio diversification strategy in fiscal commencing in fiscal and continuing through the first half of fiscal  the company implemented the first stage of the strategy by leveraging its capital base to achieve asset growth 
the objective of the first stage of the strategy was to reach a targeted asset size for the company established by the board of directors within a three to five year period following the conversion 
the company increased its asset size from million at june  to million at june  the bank s principal investment focus during the four year post conversion period was to originate and purchase mortgage loans principally loans secured by one to four family owner occupied homes and purchase mortgage backed securities 
the asset growth was funded through significant increases in federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowings and increases in deposits  primarily brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits 
pursuit of the foregoing strategy resulted in increases in the company s net income  earnings per share  return on average equity roae and return on average assets roaa in fiscal  and excluding the impact of the one time industry wide saif assessment in fiscal  pursuit of the strategy also resulted in increases in the company s net income  earnings per share  roae and roaa for fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
starting in the latter half of fiscal and continuing in fiscal  the company implemented the second stage of its post conversion plan in order to continue to increase net income  earnings per share  roae and roaa 
this strategy involved shifting the focus from asset growth to asset portfolio diversification  while maintaining prudent capital and liquidity levels 
this was  and continues to be achieved by altering the composition of loans and securities originated  purchased  sold and held in the total asset portfolio 
in particular  the company focused and will focus on originating and purchasing higher yielding multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loans secured by properties or assets located within the company s primary lending area as defined herein  which will either replace or supplement the lower yielding one to four family mortgage loans and principal run off from the mortgage securities portfolio 
the company also evaluated opportunities to purchase multi family  commercial real estate  and commercial business loans or participation interests in such loans secured by properties or business assets located outside the company s primary lending area 
in fiscal  the company purchased an aggregate of million  or of gross loans at june   of loans and participation interests in loans originated by other lenders and secured by properties located outside of the company s primary lending area as defined herein 
these loans and participation interests consisted primarily of commercial real estate and commercial real estate construction loans 
the company also expanded its origination of higher yielding loans through its commercial lending division  which offers commercial industrial real estate term loans  equipment leasing  inventory equipment receivables financing  lines of credit  letters of credit and sba loan programs 
the company originated and purchased million in various commercial business loans  either unsecured or secured by commercial business assets located as of june   of which million were secured by business assets located outside of the company s primary lending area 
asset portfolio diversification in fiscal was funded through principal repayment cash flows from existing assets  wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits  the sale of one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market  the maturity and sale of mortgage backed and related securities  retail deposits and fhlb advances 
in fiscal  the company intends to continue the implementation of the second phase of its business plan with a moderate rate of growth of its asset base 
the company s business strategy is to continue its focus on increasing net interest income and generating additional non interest income from existing and new revenue sources 
in order to increase net interest income  the company intends to continue to utilize its asset portfolio diversification strategy of selling lower yielding assets such as securities and one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market in order to provide liquidity to fund higher yielding loan originations and purchases  increase non interest income and maintain adequate levels of capital 
the company anticipates that increased sales of one to four family mortgage loans will decrease the proportion of the gross loan portfolio represented by such loans  will increase non interest income as a result of increased gains on the sales of such loans  and will further lessen the company s negative gap position as such loans are replaced by higher yielding  adjustable rate assets  including multi family  commercial real estate and commercial loans 
portfolio diversification in fiscal also will include continued purchases of loans or participation interests in loans originated by other lenders both within and outside of its primary lending area as well as originators outside of the primary lending area 
loans purchased  or participation interests purchased  which relate to properties or business assets located outside of the company s primary lending area will consist primarily of multi family  commercial real estate  multi family construction  commercial real estate construction loans and commercial business loans 
in deciding whether or not to originate or purchase a loan or participation interest in a loan originated outside of the company s primary lending area  management of the company has applied  and continues to apply  underwriting guidelines which are at least as strict as those applicable to the origination of similar loans within its primary lending area 
the company intends to fund its asset portfolio diversification in fiscal through a combination of retail deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market  the maturity and sale of mortgage backed and related securities  and fhlb advances 
in addition  in fiscal  the company intends to continue increasing the activities of its commercial lending division as another element of the overall portfolio diversification strategy 
the focus of the company s commercial lending operation will be small business loans and leases 
management currently anticipates that the commercial lending division will generate approximately million in new commercial loans leases during fiscal management believes that the commercial lending component of its operations will benefit the company longer term  and should contribute to a long term increase in net income and return on equity 
the commercial lending division also has enhanced the company s core deposit base  through the establishment of new deposit relationships with the commercial lending division s customers 
as of june   commercial deposits totaled million or of the company s core deposit base 
the company also intends to increase non interest income and net interest income in fiscal by exploring ways to expand its lending activities into higher credit risk financial services also known as subprime lending 
the subprime lending market includes manufactured housing  automobile  credit card  business  and residential first and second mortgage financing 
the subprime mortgage market for first and second mortgage loans  on which the company currently intends to  represents loans that do not conform to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and fannie mae guidelines 
the borrowers on such loans typically have credit deficiencies on their credit history  such as late payments on their mortgage loan  low credit scores  foreclosures or bankruptcies 
other non conforming reasons which classify loans as subprime include higher debt to income ratios  no down payment  limited documentation  high cash out refinances or no verification of the borrower s income 
a secondary market of private investors and mortgage bankers provides a mechanism for the underwriting  sale and servicing of subprime loans 
due to the higher degree of credit risk inherent in this type of lending  subprime residential mortgage loan rates generally are higher yielding compared to conventional one to four family mortgage rates 
in addition  if sold in the secondary market  a higher origination fee and yield spread premium are paid on such loans 
the company presently is involved in the exploratory phase of assessing the subprime market 
if the company decides to proceed in the development of a subprime program  the board of directors and management intend to establish parameters in the areas of total portfolio size  underwriting guidelines  approval process  underlying collateral type and location 
in addition  in establishing such parameters  the board of directors of the company intends to evaluate the impact of such a program on the company s allowance and provision for loan loss as well as the overall financial impact on the company 
in fiscal  the company also intends to explore alternative methods of reducing net interest expense  such as offering deposit products on the company s website  evaluating potential acquisitions of retail branch networks in market areas demonstrating a lower cost of funds demand for deposit products and by actively seeking lower cost funding in the wholesale financial markets 
during fiscal  the company also intends to increase its non interest income by expanding the following three fee income producing divisions residential lending  hallmark planning services and commercial banking 
the company also intends to evaluate the feasibility and profitability of opening satellite lending facilities in communities outside of the company s primary lending area to help increase originations of one to four family first mortgage loans  which are sold in the secondary market to generate fee income 
the company s insurance subsidiary hallmark planning services  inc continues to grow as the company seeks to generate fee income from investment product and annuity sales 
the company also has begun to develop a program for mortgage contract cash processing within the commercial lending division  a service intended to generate fee income 
pursuant to such program  the bank would act as a partial sub servicer performing a cash processing function for nationally originated commercial real estate loans 
the increase in the level of the allowance for losses on loans during fiscal was primarily the result of increases in the commercial  home equity and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate and commercial business assets generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans and carry larger balances 
the increased credit risk is the result of several factors  including concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the effect of general economic conditions on income producing properties  and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans 
also  the repayment of loans secured by commercial business assets is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the business for which the loan was made 
management anticipates that as the company s volume of multi family and commercial nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending activity continues to increase  the company will need to build a higher level of allowance for loan losses established through a provision for loan losses  which will have a negative effect on the company s net income in the short term 
however  the company believes that building the higher yielding multi family and commercial nonresidential real estate components of its gross loan portfolio will benefit the company longer term  and should contribute to a long term improvement in the company s net income and return on equity 
under regulations established for state savings banks by the wisconsin department of financial institutions  division of savings institutions dsi  as implemented by the administrator of the dsi  the bank is limited in the amount of commercial real estate and commercial business loans it can hold in its loan portfolio 
this limit is currently of the bank s total assets and may be increased with the approval of the dsi 
at june   the bank had million of such loans in its portfolio with a current limit based on the bank s asset base of million 
management anticipates that as the bank s commercial real estate and commercial business loan origination and purchase activity increases in fiscal  the bank will be required to apply to the dsi to increase the limit to an amount in excess of of the bank s asset base 
while management believes it will be able to obtain such dsi approval  there can be no assurances that if requested  the dsi will approve an increase in such lending limit for the bank  or at what lending limit level such approval will be granted 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended june  and general net income for the fiscal year ended june  increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income 
net interest income before the provision for losses on loans increased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of higher average interest earning assets during fiscal as compared to fiscal non interest income increased by  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal the increase in non interest income was primarily due to an increase in gain on the sale of loans of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal  and an increase in service charges on loans of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal also  other non interest income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal the increases were offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal  a decrease in insurance commissions of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal  and a decrease in loan servicing fees of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal also  gains on the sale of securities and mortgage backed and related securities decreased  to a loss of  for the fiscal year ended june  from a gain of  for fiscal non interest expense decreased  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of a one time industry wide fdic special assessment charge of  partially offset by a refund credit of  for the fiscal year ended june   and a decrease in deposit insurance premiums of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal the decreases were offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expense of  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal  an increase in occupancy and equipment expense of  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal  and an increase in marketing expense of  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for fiscal net income also was reduced by an increase in the provision for losses on loans to  for fiscal from  for fiscal return on average equity increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for fiscal return on average assets increased to

net interest income net interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal interest income increased million in fiscal  while interest expense increased million 
the level of net interest income primarily reflects a increase in average interest earning assets during fiscal  a increase in the excess of the company s average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  and an increased interest rate spread to for fiscal from for fiscal the increased interest rate spread for fiscal is a result of the company s origination and purchase of multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loans that carry higher interest rates than one to four family loans and mortgage backed and related securities 
interest income interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in interest income was the result of an increase in average interest earning assets of to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and an increase of basis points in the yield on interest earning assets to for fiscal from for fiscal interest income on loans increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was the result of an increase in the company s average gross loans of to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and an increase in average yield to for fiscal from for fiscal gross loans increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the company retaining all of its originated adjustable rate loans and purchasing loans from outside of its primary market 
the increase in yield is primarily attributable to the retention of higher rate adjustable rate loans  and to the higher yields paid on the multi family and commercial components of the loan portfolio 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average balances to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  partially offset by an increase in average yield to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in mortgage backed securities is expected to continue in fiscal as the company will use the principal prepayments to fund the company s continued asset portfolio diversification

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the company s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of  and rates earned or paid on  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods

   financial condition total assets increased million or  from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily reflected in increases in loans receivable and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  consistent with the company s strategy of moderate asset growth and asset portfolio diversification 
the increase was funded primarily by an increase in fhlb chicago advances and money market deposits 
starting in the later half of fiscal and continuing in fiscal  the company implemented the second stage of its post conversion strategy by shifting its focus from asset growth to asset portfolio diversification 
while the company intends to continue to originate and purchase one to four family mortgage loans  the company s long term objective is to increase net income by increasing the proportion of higher yielding assets in its loan portfolio 
the company began to implement this strategy in the second half of fiscal by increasing the multi family real estate  multi family construction and commercial nonresidential real estate components of its loan portfolio 
in the second half of fiscal  a commercial lending division began operations to continue the asset portfolio diversification 
the moderate asset growth and portfolio diversification in fiscal was funded primarily through increases in fhlb chicago advances  money market deposits and sales of loans in the secondary market 
the company intends to fund its asset portfolio diversification in fiscal through increases in retail deposits  brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits  principal repayment cash flows from existing assets  modest increases in fhlb advances subject to board imposed and regulatory limitations discussed herein  the liquidation of a portion of its available for sale portfolio  the maturity and sale of mortgage backed and related securities  and loan sales in the secondary market 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at june  compared to million at june  the decrease is largely attributable to the increase in loans receivable and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale 
investment securities decreased to  at june  compared to  at june  the change was primarily the result of management s decision to decrease its portfolio of investment securities  which consist primarily of certificates of deposits in other financial institutions  due to the competitive yields on loans in fiscal and loan portfolio diversification 
securities available for sale increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase is the result of management s decision to increase its investment in mortgage backed and related securities available for sale due to favorable competitive yields on such securities and the increased level of repayments received on the loan portfolio 
at june   the securities available for sale portfolio contained million of fixed rate us government agency securities  million of agency and private issue fixed rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of private issue adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of fixed rate intermediate term tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aaa  million of floating rate tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aa  million in trust preferred securities  million of adjustable rate mortgage mutual funds and  of municipal bonds 
mortgage backed and related securities held for investment decreased to million at june  compared to million at june  the decrease is attributable to management s decision to decrease its investment in mortgage backed and related securities to provide funding for the loan portfolio growth and diversification and increased investment in mortgage backed and related securities available for sale 
of the million in mortgage backed and related securities at june   million were adjustable rate and million were fixed rate  compared to a total of million at june   of which million were adjustable rate and million were fixed rate 
the decrease in mortgage backed and related securities was primarily attributable to the principal repayments of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and cmos in fiscal at june   million of the mortgage backed and related securities portfolio consisted of private issue mortgage backed and related securities  each issue of which carried a minimum investment rating of aa at the time of purchase and at june loans receivable increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase at june  compared to the prior fiscal year end is primarily the result of management s decision to retain more arm loans originated and purchased for the company s portfolio  as such loans carried higher yields than comparable mortgage backed and related securities in fiscal total mortgage loans originated and purchased amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  while sales of fixed rate mortgage loans totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in fixed rate mortgage loan sales is primarily attributable to the company s decision to create liquidity to fund commercial loan originations 
during fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively 
of the million in purchased loans  the company purchased million outside of its primary lending area  whereby management of the company has applied underwriting guidelines which are at least as strict as those applicable to the origination of similar loans within its primary lending area 
deposits decreased million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in deposits was primarily due to the company s decreased use of brokers to attract certificates of deposit with the company 
brokered deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits  as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  the average maturity of brokered deposits was eight months at june   compared to eleven months at june  non brokered wholesale deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  deposits are the company s primary source of externally generated funds 
the level of deposits is heavily influenced by such factors as the general level of short and long term interest rates as well as alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investment securities such as money market mutual funds 
fhlb chicago advances and other borrowings increased to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   fhlb advances were of total liabilities compared to of total liabilities at june  there were no borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements at june  and the company has increasingly used fhlb chicago advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a funding source due to attractive rates offered on advances in relation to deposit funds obtainable in the company s local market 
the company uses borrowings from the fhlb chicago and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to manage the total asset liability portfolio of the company 
for a further discussion of fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are retail and wholesale brokered deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on mortgage backed and related securities and fhlb chicago advances 
alternative funding sources are evaluated and utilized based upon factors such as interest rates  availability  maturity  administrative costs and retention capability 
although maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and prepayments on mortgage backed and related securities are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
mortgage loans and mortgage securities prepayments increased in fiscal as interest rates declined for the first half of the fiscal year before increasing in the last half of the fiscal year 
during fiscal year and  prepayments increased as interest rates decreased in the second half of the fiscal year 
the primary investing activity of the company is the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and related securities 
for fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal when originated and purchased loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the company did not purchase mortgage backed and related securities in fiscal and the company also purchased investment securities in the amount of  and during fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal and  these activities were funded primarily by principal repayments on loans of million and million  respectively  principal repayments on mortgage backed and related securities of million and million  respectively  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans of million and million  respectively  proceeds from maturity of investment securities of  and  respectively  proceeds from long term notes payable to the fhlb chicago of million and million  respectively  and a net increase in deposits of million in fiscal purchases of securities available for sale totaled million and sales were million for fiscal  compared to purchases of million and sales of million for fiscal management believes that the strategy of leveraging the capital acquired in the conversion to achieve the targeted asset size established by the board of directors within a three to five year period following the conversion  could not have been achieved solely through the use of retail deposits from the local market 
management also believes that the costs  overhead and interest expense of achieving comparable retail deposit growth would have exceeded the costs related to the use of fhlb chicago advances and wholesale brokered deposits as a funding source 
however  management recognizes that the likelihood for retention of brokered certificates of deposit is more a function of the rate paid on such accounts as compared to retail deposits which may be established due to bank location or other intangible reasons 
the company maintains a million backup credit facility for contingency purposes to replace funds from wholesale brokered deposits should retention of those deposits diminish due to extraordinary events in the financial markets 
the company s overall cost of funds has increased in recent years due primarily to a much greater percentage of the deposits being in certificates  both wholesale brokered and retail  as opposed to passbooks  money market accounts and checking accounts 
management believes that a significant portion of its retail deposits will remain with the company and  in the case of wholesale brokered deposits  may be replaced with similar type accounts even should the level of interest rates change 
however  in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates  the cost of obtaining replacement brokered deposits would increase as well 
during fiscal  the company found the use of fhlb chicago advances more attractive as a funding source than wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits 
the bank s board of directors has set a maximum limitation of total borrowings equal to of total assets 
this internal limit is below the allowable borrowing limit for all borrowings including fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements of of total assets established by the fhlb chicago 
at june   fhlb advances totaled million  or of the bank s total assets 
at june   the bank had unused borrowing authority under the borrowing limitations established by the board of directors of million and million under the fhlb total asset limitation 
the bank intends to fund asset portfolio diversification in fiscal through modest increases in fhlb advances  and to maintain the excess borrowing capacity with the fhlb as a contingent source of funds to meet liquidity needs as deemed necessary by the board of directors of the bank 
during fiscal  management shortened the maturities of both its wholesale brokered certificates of deposits and the fhlb borrowings to reduce short term liquidity risks 
as of june   the average maturity of the wholesale brokered certificates of deposit was eight months compared to eleven months in fiscal and compared to a nine month maturity for retail certificates of deposits as of june  the company is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets under the regulations of the department of financial institutions  division of savings and loan for state chartered savings banks 
savings banks are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  certain bankers acceptances  certain corporate debt securities  securities of certain mutual funds and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations of not less than since april  and prior to that date 
the company s liquidity ratios were and at june  and  respectively 
the company adjusts its liquidity levels to meet various funding needs and to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include investments in highly liquid  short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal resulted primarily from the cash used to purchase securities available for sale and to fund the increase in loans receivable 
liquidity management for the company is both an ongoing and long term function of the company s asset liability management strategy 
excess funds generally are invested in short term investments such as federal funds or overnight deposits at the fhlb chicago 
whenever the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available and obtained from the wholesale brokered and non brokered market as well as the unused credit line from the fhlb chicago subject to the board imposed and regulatory limitations discussed herein  and funds also may be available through reverse repurchase agreements wherein the company pledges investment  mortgage backed or related securities 
the company maintains a million contingent backup credit facility to replace a portion of its interest rate sensitive liabilities such as borrowings and deposits should such funding sources become difficult to obtain or retain due to an adverse interest rate environment 
the company also has a federal funds open line of credit in the amount of million with a correspondent bank which does not require the direct pledging of any assets 
in addition  the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale in order to insure sufficient sources of funds are available to meet the company s liquidity needs 
at june   the company had outstanding loan commitments of million 
the company had million in commitments to purchase mortgage backed and related securities at june  the company anticipates it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments  including loan applications received and in process to the issuance of firm commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at june  totaled million 
impact of year the company is currently in the process of addressing a potential problem that faces all users of automated systems including information systems 
many computer systems process transactions based on two digits representing the year of transaction  rather than four digits 
these computer systems may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  the problem could affect a wide variety of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers  communication systems  environmental systems and other information systems 
the company has identified areas of operations critical for the delivery of its loan and deposit products 
the majority of the company s applications used in operations are purchased from outside vendors 
the vendors providing the software are responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after december  the company s plan includes obtaining certification of compliance from third parties and testing all of the impacted applications both internally developed and third party provided 
the company s goal is to have conversion activities and testing fully compliant by june  testing of the system will occur during fiscal year contingency plans are in the process of development to address potential problems discovered during testing 
the company s plan also includes reviewing any potential risks associated with loan and deposit data base information due to the year issue 
potential risks could include  but are not limited to  system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations which may include the temporary inability to process transactions  and sending accurate customer loan payment or deposit receipt information 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that the cost to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
direct expenditures in fiscal year for the year project totaled  and it is estimated that completion of the project will result in additional expenditures of approximately  direct expenditures include capital expenditures for compliant equipment and software  write offs of non compliant equipment and software upgrades 
the expenditures will be funded by increases in the company s non interest expense budget 
currently  the company is utilizing internal staff to coordinate the year project  which may delay new product implementation through fiscal the company does not plan to engage consultants to complete the year project unless the aforementioned conversion and testing cannot be completed by the end of fiscal there can be no guarantee  that the systems of other parties on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and not have an adverse impact on the company s systems 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance 
asset liability management the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  depends to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the company is required to pay higher rates to attract deposits which can result in a decline in net interest income if the company is unable to increase the yield on its interest earning assets sufficiently to compensate for the increase in its cost of funds 
in an attempt to manage vulnerability to interest rate changes  management closely monitors the company s interest rate risk 
the company has established its investment strategies through an asset liability committee 
the committee consists of james smessaert  president ceo  peter gilbert  executive vice president coo  arthur thompson  senior vice president finance cfo  and elizabeth borst  senior vice president sales marketing 
the committee generally meets weekly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position  maturing securities and borrowings  interest rates and programs for increasing retail and brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits and originating and purchasing loans  and develops strategies regarding such issues 
in addition  the committee closely monitors the company s growth  profitability  liquidity and capital adequacy ratios 
minutes of these meetings are prepared and given to the board of directors for their review as well as formal quarterly asset liability management and investment strategy reports 
the company utilizes basic strategies in managing its assets and liabilities by managing or maximizing the net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
certain techniques such as hedging through the use of options  financial futures  and interest rate swaps historically have not been utilized by the company 
management does not intend to use such sophisticated techniques in the near future 
in addition to monitoring interest rate risk on a weekly basis  the company reviews loan and deposit rates weekly 
the emphasis has been on prudent pricing as opposed to increasing local retail market share  and the company has significantly supplemented and substituted retail deposits using fhlb chicago advances and wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits in fiscal and as a result of favorable advance and wholesale rates in relation to those obtainable on retail deposits 
generally  the company utilizes the following strategies to manage its interest rate risk i the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets  such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  ii the company seeks to primarily originate and retain mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities with short to medium term periods to re pricing  iii the company attempts to extend the maturities of retail deposits when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit with longer terms  and periodically utilizes deposit marketing programs offering maturity and repricing terms structured to complement the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing asset liability mix  iv the company also attempts to extend the maturities of wholesale brokered deposits when deemed cost effective  and v the bank utilizes longer term borrowings from the fhlb chicago to manage its assets and liabilities and enhance earnings 
at june   and  total fhlb chicago advances were million or of total assets  million or of total assets  and million or of total assets  respectively 
prior to january   most of the company s wholesale brokered and non brokered certificates of deposits had day initial maturities and  as of june   the average maturity was eight months 
liquidity is another factor in asset liability management 
as of june   the company had million in cash or demand deposits and million in its available for sale investment securities portfolio  of which million is due or will be repriced within one year 
the composition of the held to maturity investment securities portfolio as of june  was million  of which million will be due or repriced within one year 
the held to maturity investment securities due to be repriced within one year consist of mortgage backed and related securities 
by primarily originating or purchasing arm and intermediate fixed rate loans during fiscal  the company has been able to reduce interest rate risk by more closely matching the terms and repricing characteristics of its assets by extending the maturities of its liabilities to reduce interest rate risk 
however  during fiscal  the company originated for portfolio million in year fixed rate mortgage loans as compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to the decreasing interest rate environment during the second half of fiscal in addition  because of the relative liquidity of mortgage backed and related securities  the company can restructure its interest earning asset portfolios more quickly and effectively in a changing interest rate environment 
the company s arm loans and arm mortgage backed and related securities typically have annual and lifetime interest rate caps which reduce their ability to protect the company against a prolonged and significant increase in interest rates 
mortgage backed and related securities are subject to reinvestment risk 
for example  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage backed and related securities are more likely to prepay  and the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from prepayments in securities or other assets with yields similar to those of the prepaying mortgage backed and related securities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it matures or reprices within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
at june  and  total interest bearing liabilities repricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing assets repricing in the same period by million and million  respectively  representing a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap equal to and  respectively  of total assets 
the increase in the company s negative one year gap reflects the increased use of shorter term maturity deposits and fhlb advances to fund adjustable rate mortgage loans  intermediate fixed rate loans and mortgage backed and related securities 
during periods of rising interest rates  a positive interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to positively affect net interest income while a negative interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in addition to the potentially adverse effect on net interest income resulting from increasing interest rates due to the company s one year gap position  the company could experience a substantial decrease in prepayments of its fixed rate mortgage loans with rising interest rates  which may result in a lower level of proceeds available for reinvestment 
in addition to measuring the interest rate risk as a static gap measurement  the company also measures the impact on interest income with an instantaneous increase or decrease of interest rates of   and basis points 
this shock analysis is performed monthly 
a third measurement is used whereby interest rates are ramped over a one year time frame with increases and decreases of   and basis points 
management continues to upgrade its modeling techniques related to asset liability modeling 
results of the gap  shock and ramped interest risk analysis are reviewed by the board of directors 
in fiscal  the company intends to maintain the weighted average maturity level of its fixed rate liabilities  including fhlb borrowings and certificates of deposit  to fund the asset portfolio diversification 
management anticipates that the effect of funding the origination and purchase of an increasing portfolio of multi family real estate  multi family construction and commercial nonresidential loans with such liabilities will be to lessen the company s negative gap position 
also  the origination and purchase of such assets normally carry more desirable interest rate repricing features as compared to the company s experience with one to four family mortgage lending 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities in the company s portfolios could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
asset liability management schedule the following table sets forth at june  the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the time periods indicated  based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes thereto

balances have been reduced for undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned credit insurance premiums  deferred loan fees  purchased loan discounts and the allowance for loan losses  which aggregated million at june  although the company s negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts generally are subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a certain historical amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities and times to repricing based on the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are assumed to be withdrawn at annual rates of  and  respectively  of the declining balance of such accounts during the period shown 
the withdrawal rates used are higher than the company s historical rates but are considered by management to be more indicative of expected withdrawal rates currently 
if all of the company s now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts had been assumed to be subject to repricing within one year  the one year cumulative deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities would have been million or of total assets 
adjustable and floating rate borrowings are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps or options 
however  the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the company
