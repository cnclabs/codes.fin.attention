cash flows fiscal fiscal fiscal percent percent amount change amount change amount dollars in millions cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash provided by financing net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash at beginning of year cash at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash has been provided from operating activities 
the increases in cash from operations during fiscal and are primarily due to higher earnings  non cash charges depreciation and amortization and lower income tax payments  partially offset by increased working capital requirements

at april   million was available for borrowing under this program  down from million at march  in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
on february   the board of directors redeemed the stock purchase rights issued under the stockholder rights plan and established march  as the record date for payment of the redemption price of one sixth of one cent per right  which was paid on april  year throughout its history  csc has dealt with ongoing significant changes in the information technology industry 
as a result  resources are constantly being employed to modify  upgrade and enhance systems and infrastructure on behalf of clients and internal needs 
the year issue represents another one of these changes 
it is the result of computer programs which represent years as a two digit field rather than a four digit field 
any of such programs that utilize date sensitive data may not properly recognize a date field of as the year  but as some other date  typically the year this could result in possible system failure or miscalculations which affect normal business activity 
the company has established a comprehensive two phase program to ensure that its proprietary software and internal computer systems are year ready 
the initial phase  which included planning  inventory and assessment  has been completed 
the final phase  which consists of correction  testing  deployment and acceptance  is in process and is expected to be completed by mid the company expects that the cost of making its proprietary software and internal systems compliant will not have a material effect on its overall financial position or overall trends in results of operations 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its crucial suppliers to determine that they are or will be year capable 
the company has been working with its clients and has completed an assessment of its obligations to make their systems year ready 
as a result of this assessment  the company does not believe that these obligations will have a material effect on the company 
the company has experienced significant growth in year engagements and expects that trend to continue for the next few years 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board recently issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company will adopt these standards for fiscal which will expand or modify disclosures and will have no impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which supersedes sop  software revenue recognition 
sop provides further guidance on recognizing revenue from sales of proprietary software and is effective for transactions csc enters into beginning in fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of sop to have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
market risk the company has fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper  and other borrowings which are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
during the ordinary course of business  the company also enters into certain transactions contracted in foreign currency which are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical ten percent movement in interest rates or a ten percent fluctuation in the us dollar against all currencies would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings  fair value  or cash flows
