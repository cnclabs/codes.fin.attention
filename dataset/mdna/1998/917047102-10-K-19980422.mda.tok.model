general the company is composed of two retail subsidiaries  urban retail and anthropologie  and a wholesale subsidiary 
urban retail is the largest of the three  has the highest gross profit margins and generates most of the company s revenues and profits 
urban retail had stores opened at january  and at january  the company s first anthropologie store opened in october anthropologie had nine stores opened at january  and eight at january  the company has plans to open seven urban retail stores and five anthropologie stores in fiscal the recent growth in the wholesale company is from both the domestic and international markets 
fiscal and continued as very profitable years for urban outfitters with earnings to net sales of and  respectively  as well as return on shareholders equity of and  respectively 
the slight contraction of earnings as a percent of net sales in fiscal and the direction of return on shareholders equity in that year resulted primarily from a slowdown in retail sales growth in fiscal the wholesale company recorded sales growth of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the wholesale company is not expected to grow at those rates in fiscal and could experience a reduction in sales during fiscal the company has established a european subsidiary urban outfitters uk ltd 
and expects to open its first urban retail store in london in may the european subsidiary incurred expenses without the benefit of sales during fiscal while fiscal is expected to have sales from the london store  the subsidiary will still operate at a loss during fiscal in late fiscal and in early fiscal  the company invested in two direct marketing concepts 
the first is a owned catalog under the anthropologie retail subsidiary and carries the anthropologie name 
the second is a minority investment in a teenage catalog magazine combination called moxiegirl tm 
both are expected to incur losses during their start up phases 
the period of start up could encompass two years for either or both 
the company s fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to fiscal years of the company refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  the company s fiscal year ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain income statement data from period to period 
fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net interest and other expenses income 
income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period dollar growth net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales decreases of million  net sales increases of million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal and fiscal and net sales increases of million from the wholesale company 
the decrease in comparable store sales of or million results primarily from one merchandise division that did not perform to prior year levels 
average selling prices were not a significant determinate of fiscal sales levels 
new and enlarged stores included seven stores opened in fiscal and three opened in fiscal the company believes increased net sales from the wholesale subsidiary during fiscal and were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers 
the company s gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies and a higher sales mix in the lower gross profit margin companies anthropologie and wholesale 
markdowns were triggered by lower than planned comparable store sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  an increase 
as a percentage of net sales  the expenses increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in percentage was attributable to the retail companies lower comparable store sales and investments in people and systems to accommodate the sales growth in the wholesale company over the last two years of and 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of million  net sales of million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal and fiscal and net sales increases of million from the wholesale company 
the comparable store sales increase of or million in fiscal over results from the inverse relationship of higher average selling prices and fewer pieces sold 
the higher average selling prices representing approximately million and the fewer pieces sold approximately million leaves million in comparable store sales 
new and enlarged stores included four stores opened in fiscal and seven opened in fiscal the company believes increased net sales from the wholesale subsidiary during fiscal were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers 
the company s gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies  high growth of a new  lower margin product line in the wholesale company  and a mix swing to higher sales in the lower gross profit margin companies anthropologie and wholesale 
markdowns were triggered by lower than plan comparable store sales and by late openings of two urban retail stores 
the new wholesale product line did not have production economies of scale enjoyed by its larger and more established product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
as a percentage of net sales  the expenses increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in percentage was attributable to urban retail due to lower comparable store sales 
conversely  both anthropologie and wholesale experienced selling  general and administrative expense leveraging on significant sales growth 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three years the company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations 
the company s primary uses of cash have been to open new stores  build a new distribution center and purchase inventories 
most recently  the company invested in two direct response catalogs and in a new european subsidiary 
in addition to cash generated from operations  sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of fiscal  and over the next few years  the company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash  including investments in the catalog companies 
although the company has not borrowed short term or long term funds during the last five fiscal years  it maintains a line of credit of million  of which all is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit 
the line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest at an as offered basis not to exceed libor plus of percent 
the company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers 
outstanding balances of letters of credit at january  and were million and million  respectively 
there were no short term or long term debts outstanding at january  or at january  the company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for at least the next three years 
other matters year the company has examined each area of its business systems from ibm operating systems  to business application systems  to store register systems that it believes could be affected by the date change issue of the year it has also reviewed the implemented changes or planned changes of its major suppliers that it believes would be effected by the year date changes 
many of the needed changes are complete  some are still taking place and all are expected to be completed and in place before the critical times in calendar the expenses associated with the changes are not expected to be of a material nature to the company 
future accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income and no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company will adopt these new accounting standards in fiscal while management has not yet completed its assessment of how and if sfas will impact the company s existing segment disclosures  both standards are for disclosure purposes only and will have no adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
seasonality and quarterly results while urban outfitters has been profitable in each of its last operating quarters  its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the company s highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material  adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with  and sales contributed by  new stores  store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the company 
fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of the wholesale products between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters
