overview the company is a leading multinational supplier of information management software 
it derives license revenues principally from licensing its rdbms software and derives service revenues from providing technical product support and product updates and consulting and training services to customers 
the company s products are sold directly to end users and indirectly through application resellers  oem s and distributors 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a substantial shortfall in license revenues compared to forecasts  resulting in a substantial loss for that quarter 
the shortfall in revenue was due to slow growth in demand for rdbms products as well as the company s inability to close a number of sales transactions that management anticipated would close by quarter s end  particularly in europe 
as a result of the shortfall in license revenues for the first quarter of fiscal  the company  in the second quarter and again in the third quarter of fiscal  initiated an internal restructuring of its operations intended to reduce operating expenses and improve the company s financial condition 
these restructurings included selective reductions in headcount and leased facilities and the downsizing  elimination or conversion into solution labs of the company s planned information superstores 
costs associated with the restructurings totaled approximately million and had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for fiscal in addition  the company issued newly designated series of preferred stock in two financing transactions which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of million to the company excluding a million fee paid to a financial advisor of the company in connection with the sale of the series b preferred and entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement with available proceeds of up to million  of which the company was eligible to borrow million at december   based on certain eligibility criteria 
see recent sales of unregistered securities and liquidity and capital resources 
in august  the company announced that it had become aware of errors and irregularities that affected the timing and the dollar amount of reported earned revenues from license transactions for all annual periods in the three years ended december  these errors and irregularities included unauthorized and undisclosed arrangements or agreements between company personnel and resellers  recognition of revenue on certain transactions in reporting periods prior to contract acceptance  the recording of certain transactions that lacked economic substance and the recording of maintenance revenue as license revenue 
the unauthorized and undisclosed agreements with resellers introduced acceptance contingencies  permitted resellers to return unsold licenses for refunds  extended payment terms or committed the company to assist resellers in selling the licenses to end users 
accordingly  license revenues from these transactions that were recorded at the time product was delivered to resellers should have instead been recorded at the time all conditions to the sale lapsed 
because of the pervasiveness of the unauthorized arrangements with resellers in the  and accounting periods  the company concluded that all revenue from license agreements with resellers  except for those licenses sold and billed on a per copy basis  should be recognized only when the licenses were resold or utilized by resellers and all related obligations had been satisfied 
in addition  amounts received from resellers or financial institutions as prepayments of software license fees in advance of revenue recognition should be recorded as advances on unearned license revenue 
the financial review undertaken by the company resulted in the restatement of the company s financial results for fiscal  and and for the first quarter of fiscal the company publicly disclosed the results of the restatement in november in connection with the errors and irregularities discussed above  a number of conditions which collectively represented a material weakness in the company s internal accounting controls were identified 
these conditions included a deterioration in the company s accounting controls at corporate and regional management levels  and a related failure to stress the importance of these controls  an inappropriate level of influence  principally by the company s sales organization  over the revenue recognition process and an apparent lack of clarity and consistent understanding within the company concerning the application of the company s revenue recognition policies to large  complex reseller license transactions 
to address the material weakness represented by these conditions  the company is implementing a plan to strengthen the company s internal accounting controls 
this plan includes updating the company s revenue recognition policies regarding accounting and reporting for large  complex reseller license transactions  developing and conducting educational programs to help implement such policies  changing the company s corporate and regional accounting and reporting structure and re establishing the internal audit function reporting to the company s board of directors 
as a result of the restatement  total revenues were reduced from amounts previously reported by million from million as originally reported to million  by million from million as originally reported to million  and by million from million as originally reported to million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the restatement also resulted in an increase in revenues of million from million as originally reported to million for the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the restatement resulted in a reduction in net income of million from million as originally reported to a loss of million for fiscal  a reduction in net income of million from million as originally reported to million for fiscal  and a reduction in net income of million from million as originally reported to million for fiscal the restatement had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  most notably evidenced by substantial reductions in retained earnings and working capital 
at december   after giving effect to the restatement  the company s working capital decreased million from million as originally reported to million 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million 
the substantial reductions in working capital at december  and reflect substantial operating losses and the addition of advances on unearned license revenue as a current liability on the company s balance sheet 
such advances totaled million at december  and million at december  the company s public announcement of the pending restatement  delays in reporting operating results for the second and third quarters of fiscal while the restatement was being compiled  threatened de listing of the company s common stock from the nasdaq national market as a result of the company s failure to satisfy its public reporting obligations  corporate actions to restructure operations and reduce operating expenses  and customer uncertainty regarding the company s financial condition adversely affected the company s ability to sell its products in fiscal the financial restatement has now been completed  its results have been publicly disclosed and the company is current with respect to its public reporting obligations 
in addition  the company believes that it has effectively controlled its operating expenses and significantly improved its financial condition 
nevertheless  adverse market conditions  including significant competitive pressures in the company s markets and ongoing customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and business prospects  may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and results of operations

revenue declined for fiscal in comparison to fiscal revenue declined   and in north america  asia pacific  europe and latin america  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses reflects continued expansion of product and customer support organizations through the early months of fiscal as well as incremental legal and audit expenses related to the stockholder lawsuits and the restatement process  charges of million related to the company s japanese operations  million for restructuring charges  million for write down to net realizable value of previously capitalized software costs and million for a write off of acquired research and development during the period 
the lower revenues combined with increased operating costs resulted in an operating loss of million for the year 
see legal proceedings  cost of software distribution  write off of acquired research and development  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges 
informix s operating results were affected negatively in fiscal as a result of operating expenses growing more rapidly than revenues 
informix continued to invest heavily in personnel in the areas of sales  marketing and customer service and research and development and incurred integration expenses and fees associated with the acquisition in february of illustra 
in december  informix began shipping its universal server product 
informix incurred significant marketing expenses in connection with the initial announcement and launch of the universal server in fiscal these development  integration and marketing expenses adversely affected informix s operating margins in fiscal revenues the company derives revenues from licensing its software and providing post license technical product support and updates to customers and from consulting and training services 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by the company or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
service revenues consist of customer telephone or direct support  product update rights  consulting and training fees 
total net revenues were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
between december  and  total net revenues decreased by or million  primarily as a result of a substantial decrease in license revenues  partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
between december  and  total net revenues increased by or million 
license revenues the company sells its products directly to end users as well as through resellers  including oem s  distributors and var s 
during fiscal  the company increased the focus on its reseller channels to establish partnerships with hardware and application vendors in order to utilize their sales force  obtain access to their installed base of customers and benefit from their consulting and systems integration organizations 
the company recognizes license revenue from resellers  except for those sold and billed on a per copy basis  when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all related obligations have been satisfied 
license revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year to year declines in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflect the fact that service revenues have grown at a faster pace than license revenues  and that license revenues declined substantially in fiscal license revenue declined by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  license revenues decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal this decrease was primarily due to slow growth in demand for rdbms products as well as the company s inability to close a number of sales transactions that management anticipated would close by quarter s end  particularly in europe 
in the second quarter of fiscal  license revenue increased compared to the first quarter  principally as a result of stronger product license sales in north america 
in the third quarter of fiscal  license revenues decreased compared to the second quarter 
the decrease in the third quarter was attributable to a significant extent to decreased product license sales in europe and latin america and customer uncertainties resulting from the company s announcement of the restatement of its financial statements in august and restructuring activities in september during the fourth quarter of fiscal  license revenues increased as compared to the third quarter of fiscal the increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal was principally due to increased license sales in europe and latin america  which the company believes was due to improved customer confidence about the company and its financial condition following the announcement of its restated financial statements 
the company does not believe that the decrease in license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a reduced acceptance of the company s products or a reduced competitive advantage of its products 
the company believes that this decrease was primarily attributable to the slowing growth in the market for rdbms products and customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and viability  due to the company s operating losses in the first three quarters of fiscal  the announcement of the restatement  the delays in reporting operating results for the second and third quarters of fiscal  the threatened de listing of the company s common stock from the nasdaq national market as a result of the company s failure to satisfy its public reporting obligations  and the company s actions to restructure operations and reduce operating expenses 
in addition  the company experienced a significant turnover in senior management sales positions during  which adversely affected sales 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company filled certain key sales positions through new hires  internal promotion and reorganization of its sales force 
license revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the license revenue growth during fiscal reflects an increase in sales of the company s server products  particularly the company s flagship database server  online dynamic server  partially offset by a decrease in license revenues from its database tool products 
the increase in server product revenues during fiscal reflected continued acceptance of the company s server products 
the company believes that the rdbms industry has benefited from market acceptance of unix  windows  windows nt and other open operating environments and trends to downsize from large proprietary computer systems 
the company believes that the decline in license revenues derived from its database tool products is primarily the result of competitive product offerings from other companies 
at december   and licenses not resold by resellers representing approximately million  million and million  respectively  were recorded as advances on unearned license revenues and had not been recognized as earned revenue 
licenses originally recorded as advances on unearned license revenue representing approximately million  million and million were sold through reseller channels to end users during fiscal  and  respectively  and recognized as earned revenue 
the company estimates that approximately to million of the advances on unearned license revenues of million at december  will be sold through to end users during fiscal nevertheless  there can be no assurances that such licenses will be resold 
if the underlying license agreements expire and are not renewed prior to resellers selling all licenses to end users and the company has no remaining obligations  the remaining revenue relating to customers advances will be recognized in the quarter following the expiration of the reseller license agreements 
the company s license transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  these transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the industry  a disproportional amount of the company s license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
the company expects that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations will continue 
the company is currently unable to forecast whether the decreases in license revenue experienced in fiscal will continue in fiscal during  substantial uncertainty existed about the company s business and financial condition 
the company believes that various actions taken by the company during have substantially improved its financial condition 
see restructuring charges and liquidity and capital resources 
nevertheless  adverse market conditions  including significant competive pressures and ongoing customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and business prospects  could continue to have an adverse effect on license revenues and results of operations 
service revenues service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal service revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
as the company s products become more complex  more support services are expected to be required 
the company intends to satisfy this requirement through internal support  third party services and oem support 
service revenues are comprised of maintenance  consulting and training revenues 
the company continues to emphasize support services as a source of revenue and the growth achieved in absolute dollars reflects the growth in the company s installed base and strategic focus on providing consulting services for its customers 
the year to year increases in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflect the fact that service revenues have continued to grow while license revenues declined substantially in fiscal revenue derived from post contract technical support and fees for software updates increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is attributable principally to maintenance contracts for new license sales in each year as well as the renewal of existing maintenance contracts 
in the event the company continues to experience substantial declines in license revenue  such declines would be expected to have an adverse effect on growth in service revenues 
consulting and training revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and in fiscal from million in fiscal the growth in the consulting and training practice was driven by increased demand for consulting services primarily in north america and in europe 
some significant one time large consulting contracts were also executed in fiscal and contributed to the significant increase of consulting revenues year over year 
there can be no assurances that similar one time large consulting contracts will be entered into in future periods 
failure to secure such contracts may have an adverse impact on the growth of service revenues 
geographic distribution the company s distribution markets are organized into four general markets north america  europe  the middle east and africa  latin america  and the asia pacific region  including japan 
the north america  europe  latin america and asia pacific organizations contributed   and of the company s net revenues  respectively  in fiscal  compared to   and  respectively  in fiscal and   and  respectively  in fiscal approximately  and of informix s net revenues were derived from sales to foreign customers in fiscal  and  respectively 
informix expects that foreign revenues will continue to provide a significant portion of total revenues 
however  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the condition of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of foreign revenues in the future 
in europe and asia pacific most revenues and expenses are now denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar strengthened in fiscal against the major european and asia pacific currencies  which resulted in lower revenue and expenses recorded when translated into us dollars  compared with the prior year periods 
although the company has also increased its direct presence in latin america  a significant percentage of this region s revenue is still denominated in us dollars 
although the effect was not significant in fiscal  the company has in the past experienced significant currency fluctuations in mexico  and to a lesser extent  other latin american countries  and expects such fluctuations may occur in the future 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the current continued weakness observed in asian currencies may result in reduced revenues from the countries affected by this condition  thus having a negative impact on the overall performance of the company 
concurrent transactions principally during fiscal  the company entered into software license agreements with certain computer and service vendors where the company concurrently committed to acquire goods and services 
these concurrent transactions in fiscal included license agreements of approximately million and a commitment by the company to acquire goods and services in the aggregate of approximately million 
concurrent transactions in included license agreements of approximately million and a commitment by the company to acquire goods and services in the aggregate of approximately million

software distribution costs consist primarily of i manufacturing and related costs such as media  documentation  product assembly and purchasing costs  freight  customs  and third party royalties and ii amortization of previously capitalized software development costs including adjustments to the carrying value of such capitalized costs based on changes to the company s estimates of the net realizable value of related products 
excluding amortization and the write down to net realizable value of previously capitalized software development costs  cost of software distribution as a percentage of license revenue was for fiscal and for both fiscal and in the future  the cost of software distribution as a percentage of revenue may vary depending upon the extent to which the product is reproduced by the company or by its customers 
amortization of capitalized software costs commences the quarter following product introduction 
capitalized software amortization increased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
the increase in amortization of capitalized software in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the release of the company s universal server products in the fourth quarter of fiscal the absolute value of amortization of capitalized software will vary period to period as new products are released and other products become fully amortized 
amortization of capitalized software increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the release of several products in the latter half of fiscal and the absolute value of amortization of capitalized software will vary from quarter to quarter as new products are released and other product development costs become fully amortized 
the write down to net realizable value of million during the first quarter of fiscal was due to the company s acquisition of centerview software  inc centerview and the related announcements of its revised tool strategy 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  a net realizable value test was performed on certain of the company s database tool products and resulted in a write down of million of previously capitalized software costs 
in addition to this write down  the company recorded separately a million charge for write off of acquired research and development in connection with the company s acquisition of centerview

cost of services cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the overall growth in cost of services of between fiscal and is consistent with the growth in service revenues over the same period 
the cost of services increased significantly in fiscal as the company substantially expanded its consulting practice in the united states and europe as well as its technical support organization in order to provide customer assistance for the online dynamic server product line 
cost of services decreased as a percentage of service revenues to for fiscal compared to for the same period in during fiscal  gross margins increased relative to both support revenue and consulting training revenue  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of that year 
the company believes that the increased margins during fiscal were principally attributable to more efficient delivery of services 
the increase in cost of services in fiscal in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues compared to the prior year is primarily due to the company s expansion of consulting and support service capabilities as products have become more complex 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased less than to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to a reduction in net revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to significant increases in sales and marketing personnel and marketing programs starting in late during the late months of fiscal and in the early months of fiscal  there were significant increases in personnel and expenses as the company continued to expand its sales force for anticipated license revenue growth and continued to implement various marketing programs  including its information superstore program 
the information superstore program  which was launched in fiscal and through the early months of  resulted in increased depreciation expense due to the fixed asset purchases related to the program 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal in absolute dollars compared to fiscal was a result of continued increased expenses in the early months of fiscal  offset by a significant reduction in overall sales and marketing expenses in the second half of fiscal in connection with the restructuring plan executed by the company 
due to the significant revenue shortfall in the first quarter of fiscal  the company executed internal restructuring plans in the second quarter and again in the third quarter  which included reducing headcount  consolidating facilities and operations  and downsizing  eliminating or converting information superstores into solution labs managed by the company s consulting practice 
the company had significantly lower sales and marketing costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of these measures 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were reduced to million 
costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal were lower than the prior year quarter and lower than the third quarter of fiscal the significant increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal in absolute dollars compared to fiscal was a result of the addition of new sales offices and sales personnel worldwide as the company expanded its worldwide sales organization  the opening of new foreign offices  higher commission expense associated with the increase of revenues prior to the restatement and increased marketing programs associated with new product launches 
research and development expenses change change dollars in millions incurred product development expenditures expenditures capitalized research and development expenses expenditures capitalized as a percentage of incurred research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the year to year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars for fiscal  is attributable principally to an increase in staff which occurred during the early part of fiscal  working on new products and product extensions 
the year to year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars for fiscal is attributable principally to an increase in staff  working on the development of new products and product extensions  including universal server 
informix accounts for its software development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement requires that  once technological feasibility of a developing product has been established  all subsequent costs incurred in developing that product to a commercially acceptable level be capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue life of the product 
prior to fiscal  the higher capitalization in absolute dollars of product development expenditures from year to year resulted from an increase in the work involved in projects having already reached technological feasibility as they neared their release dates  including universal data options formerly informix universal server 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position in its primary markets and expects the expenditure levels to continue to constitute a significant percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in fiscal in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of the continued expansion of the company s international operations  higher bad debt expense of million  incremental legal and auditing expenses of million resulting from the stockholders litigation and the restatement of the company s financial statements  and the write off of certain assets of million 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of the continued expansion of the company s international operations 
write off of goodwill and other long term assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in its operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company s japanese subsidiary experienced a significant shortfall in business activity compared to historical levels 
this fact  coupled with continuing competitive pressures in the japanese market  resulted in the company adjusting its forecasts of the subsidiary s future cash flows and further led the company to evaluate the recoverability of the subsidiary s long lived assets  including computer and other equipment  acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
as a result of this evaluation  the company determined that the carrying value of these long lived assets had been impaired and  accordingly  recorded a charge in the first quarter of million to write down the assets carrying value to their estimated fair value 
fair value was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows of the subsidiary and or resale values as appropriate 
write off of acquired research and development in february  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of centerview  a privately owned corporation that provides software tools for application development 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which included cash plus direct costs of acquisition 
for financial statement purposes  the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  based on an independent appraisal of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the purchase price was allocated to the specifically identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including approximately million of purchased research and development which has been charged to operations in the period the acquisition was consummated  the first quarter of fiscal based on a review of centerview s current suite of products  the company s management identified and classified future versions of the company s data director product as in process technology  specifically versions and  as of the date of its acquisition 
data director is an integrated development extension for microsoft visual basic that enables companies to build corporate intranet and client server applications in a single environment 
data director enhances visual basic with a model driven data access engine that manages all database interactions between client and server  eliminating the complexity traditionally associated with client server development and enabling companies to build client server applications faster and more efficiently than with visual basic alone 
based on discussions with centerview management  including project development project managers regarding the stage of development of versions and  it was determined that these projects had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the centerview acquisition  nor did these projects have any alternative future use 
this determination was based primarily on an assessment of the history of the research and development schedules for the projects  their current stage of development  the risks inherent in completing the incremental research and development efforts necessary to reach technological feasibility  and the planned general release dates 
version was scheduled for first customer release in july while version was anticipated to reach first customer release in april based on the discussions with centerview management regarding historical product releases  it was determined that commercial release occurs approximately two to three months after first customer introduction of the product 
the projects are expected to produce positive levels of cash flow during the year ended december  moreover  the company estimated that the costs to complete these projects would be approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal these figures were estimated by considering i the development schedules of the in process projects  ii complexity of the identified development projects  and iii number of engineer hours per project  per year 
the market for the company s data director product is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and evolving market and customer demands 
although centerview successfully developed and marketed data director version and previous versions  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing the enhanced versions of the data director product 
as such  the in process technology embedded in data director versions and was valued utilizing risk adjusted cash flows to incorporate these and other uncertainties associated with the company s product development efforts 
failure to successfully complete these efforts in a timely manner could adversely affect the market potential for the acquired centerview products 
restructuring charges in june and again in september  the company approved plans to restructure its operations in order to bring expenses in line with forecasted revenues 
in connection with these restructurings  the company substantially reduced its worldwide headcount and consolidated facilities and operations to improve efficiency 
the following analysis sets forth the significant components of the restructuring reserve at december  restructuring non cash cash accrual balance at expense costs payments december  in millions severance and benefits write off of assets facility charges other 
severance and benefits represent the reduction of approximately employees  primarily sales and marketing personnel  on a worldwide basis 
temporary employees and contractors were also reduced 
write off of assets include the write off or write down in carrying value of equipment as a result of the company s decision to reduce the number of information superstores throughout the world  as well as the write off of equipment associated with headcount reductions 
the equipment subject to the write offs and write downs consists primarily of computer servers  workstations  and personal computers that will no longer be utilized in the company s operations 
these assets were written down to their fair value less cost to sell 
facility charges include early termination costs associated with the closing of certain domestic and international sales offices 
the total restructuring expense decreased by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to adjusting the original estimate of the loss to be incurred on the sale of land to the actual loss 
the company expects to complete most of the actions associated with restructuring by the end of the second quarter of fiscal merger expenses in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded expenses of approximately million as a result of the acquisition of illustra  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
these costs consisted primarily of investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
interest income interest income was million as compared to million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal in comparison to fiscal resulted from a reduction in the average interest bearing cash and short term investments balances in fiscal the reduction in cash is due to lower sales and higher expenses 
the increase in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by slightly lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased to million from million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense principally relates to interest charges incurred in connection with financing of customer accounts receivable and has increased due to an increase in the average balance of receivables financed 
these financing costs are expensed ratably over the term of the financing arrangement 
other income  net other income  net  increased to million for fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal was due primarily to million of net gains on the sale of marketable securities and million of foreign currency transaction gains  offset partially by adjustments of million to the carrying value of strategic investments and million of other expenses 
other income  net  in fiscal consisted of million of gain on sale of marketable securities offset by other net expenses of million 
the restatement of the  and financial statements resulted in a change in the company s foreign currency denominated intercompany accounts payable and accounts receivable balances 
as a result  certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses realized due to fluctuation in the related asset and liability currency exchange rates were not offset by underlying gains and losses on forward foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge those foreign currency exposures 
the company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million  
million and 
million in fiscal  and  respectively  the restatement of the company s financial statements affected the recorded net foreign currency transaction gains and losses as follows million  million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
income taxes in fiscal  income tax expense resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the expected tax benefit computed by applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before income taxes was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets in excess of amounts recoverable through carryback of net operating losses 
accordingly  realization of the net deferred tax asset at december  of million is not dependent on future taxable income 
in fiscal  income tax expense resulted from an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions

the total restructuring expenses decreased by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to adjusting the original estimate of the loss to be incurred on the sale of land to the actual loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying values of certain of its japanese subsidiary s long lived assets to their fair values 
during the same quarter  the company also recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying value of capitalized software development costs for certain products to their net realizable values

factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including the following uncertain impact of restatement of financial statements subsequent to the filing with the commission of its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   the company became aware of errors and irregularities that affected the timing and dollar amount of reported earned revenues from license transactions for all annual periods in the three years ended december   in particular transactions involving unauthorized or undisclosed arrangements or agreements with resellers 
as a result of its investigation into these errors and irregularities  in august  the company announced that it would restate its financial results for fiscal and the financial review undertaken by the company to determine the extent of the restatement ultimately resulted in the restatement of the company s financial results for fiscal  and and for the first quarter of fiscal the company publicly disclosed the results of the restatement in november the restatement had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  most notably evidenced by substantial reductions in retained earnings and working capital 
for a description of the errors and irregularities identified and the impact of the restatement on the company s reported revenues and net income for fiscal  and and the first quarter of fiscal  see working capital deficit and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations 
in connection with the errors and irregularities discussed above  a number of conditions which collectively represented a material weakness in the company s internal accounting controls were identified 
these conditions included a deterioration in the company s accounting controls at corporate and regional management levels  and a related failure to stress the importance of these controls  an inappropriate level of influence  principally by the company s sales organization  over the revenue recognition process and an apparent lack of clarity and consistent understanding within the company concerning the application of the company s revenue recognition policies to large  complex reseller license transactions 
to address the material weakness represented by these conditions  the company is adopting a plan to strengthen the company s internal accounting controls 
this plan includes updating the company s revenue recognition policies regarding accounting and reporting for large  complex reseller license transactions  developing and conducting educational programs to help implement such policies  changing the company s corporate and regional accounting and reporting structure  and re establishing the internal audit function reporting to the company s board of directors 
such implementation is expected to require substantial management attention

the company s public announcement in august of the pending restatement  delays in reporting operating results for the second and third quarters of fiscal while the restatement was being compiled  threatened de listing of the company s common stock from the nasdaq national market as a result of the company s failure to satisfy its public reporting obligations  corporate actions to restructure operations and reduce operating expenses  and customer uncertainty regarding the company s financial condition adversely affected the company s ability to sell its products in fiscal in addition  since the beginning of  the company and its competitors in the rdbms industry have experienced substantially slower growth in the market for rdbms products 
the financial restatement has now been completed  its results have been publicly disclosed  and the company is current with respect to its public reporting obligations 
in addition  the company believes that it has effectively controlled its operating expenses and significantly improved its financial condition 
nevertheless  adverse market conditions  including significant competitive pressures in the company s markets and ongoing customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and business prospects  may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality 
need for additional financing  customer financing during fiscal  the company experienced substantial short term liquidity problems as its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined to a quarter end low of million at june  from million at december  the company raised net proceeds of million in august and million excluding a million fee paid to a financial advisor of the company in november in separate financing transactions in which the company issued newly authorized series of convertible preferred stock 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised aggregate net proceeds of million through the sale of real property it had purchased earlier in the year 
as a result of such financing activities during the second half of  the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december  in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company raised aggregate net proceeds of million in connection with the exercise of a warrant to acquire additional shares of the company s convertible preferred stock 
the company believes that these actions have substantially improved its financial condition since early nevertheless  adverse market conditions  including continued slower growth rates in the markets for rdbms products or on going customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and business prospects  could continue to have an adverse effect on license revenues and results of operations 
in addition  recent instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets  which accounted for approximately and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  has created further uncertainty concerning the company s revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
in december  informix software entered into the credit facility providing for a revolving credit line of up to million 
the actual amount available under the credit facility  for either direct borrowings or issuances of letters of credit  is based on percent of the eligible domestic accounts receivable and percent of the eligible foreign accounts receivable 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility  the company s accounts receivable totaled million and its borrowing base under the credit facility was million 
the purpose of the credit facility is to provide the company working capital and finance general corporate purposes

amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a premium over one of two alternative variable rates selected by the company 
the credit facility is secured by all of the assets of informix software and the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries that are domiciled in the united states  including informix software

there can be no assurance that amounts raised in connection with the preferred stock financing and real property sales transactions described above and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to cover the company s working capital needs or that the company will not require additional debt or equity financing in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available  if and when needed or that  if available  such financing could be completed on commercially favorable terms 
failure to obtain additional financing  if and when needed  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

in the normal course of its business  the company arranges for non recourse financing through the sale of customer accounts receivable to third party financial institutions

see working capital deficit and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
working capital deficit the restatement of the company s financial statements has had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  most notably evidenced by substantial reductions in retained earnings and working capital 
at december   after giving effect to the restatement  the company s working capital totaled million  compared to million as originally reported 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million 
the substantial reduction in working capital  as restated  at december  reflects net losses in fiscal of million and the addition of million of advances on unearned license revenue as a current liability on the company s balance sheet 
the working capital deficit at december  reflects net losses of million for the year ended december   million in advances on unearned license revenue as of such date  and substantial uses of cash as a result of the company s internal restructuring  which commenced in the second quarter of fiscal advances on unearned license revenues reflects amounts previously received from customers or in connection with accounts receivable financing transactions with third party financial institutions in advance of revenue being recognized 
prior to the restatement  these amounts were improperly recognized as earned but have now been designated as advances 
a substantial majority of such revenues arose in connection with license agreements between the company and oems  distributors and other resellers 
in connection with the review of its historical financial results  the company determined that sufficient post contractual contingencies existed in connection with certain reseller license arrangements so as to preclude recognizing revenue 
in addition  the company concluded that informal or otherwise undisclosed arrangements with a number of resellers have resulted or could result in significant concessions or allowances that were not accounted for when revenue was originally reported as earned 
although the company s license agreements provide for a non refundable fee payable by the customer in single or multiple installments at the beginning or over the term of the license arrangements  amounts received by the company under its license agreements could be subject to refund in the event the company fails to satisfy certain post signing obligations 
the company is presently unable to estimate what portion  if any  of such advances may be subject to potential refund 
at december  approximately million of such amounts received from customers were subject to commercial disputes  several of which have proceeded to litigation 
of the million subject to commercial disputes  million has been reflected on the balance sheet as accrued expenses  and the company believes that the remainder is properly booked as advances on unearned license revenues as the company believes the likelihood of refund is remote 
any such refunds  were they to occur  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations as revenue has not been recognized on such transactions 
the company has abandoned its plans to construct a new headquarters facility and in december sold the real property it had purchased earlier in the year  raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in august and november  the company sold and issued newly designated series of preferred stock in two separate financing transactions  raising net proceeds of approximately million excluding of a million fee paid to a financial advisor of the company in connection with the sale of the series b preferred 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into the credit facility in the amount of million with a syndicate of commercial banks with bankboston na  as administrative agent and canadian imperial bank of commerce  as syndication agent 
the term of the credit facility is two years 
although these financing transactions have improved the company s working capital position  in the event the company continues to maintain a substantial working capital deficit  such a deficit could materially impair the company s ability to sell its products as a result of customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition 
see uncertain impact of restatement of financial statements  need for additional financing  customer financing and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  among others  i customer uncertainty about the company s financial condition and business prospects  ii market demand for the company s software  including changes in industry growth rates for the company s products  iii changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  including aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchase by customers  iv the size  timing and contractual terms of significant orders  the effect of which may be exacerbated by aggressive price discounting  v the timing of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  vi budgeting cycles of customers and potential customers  vii changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and viii seasonal trends in technology purchases and other general economic conditions 
in particular  the company s quarterly results may be adversely affected by the industry s historical practice of aggressively discounting the price of its products to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
in the event the company experiences substantial pricing pressure with respect to one or more large transactions in any given quarter  such pressure could result in a substantial shortfall in revenues 
the company has operated historically with little or no backlog and has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last weeks or days of that quarter 
in addition  the sales cycle for the company s products is relatively long and may vary depending on a number of factors  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition the company encounters in its selling activities 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in the event of any downturn in potential customers businesses  the domestic economy in general  or in international economies where the company derives substantial revenues  planned purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  delays in the recognition of revenues from even a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could cause net income to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
in the quarters ended september  and june   costs associated with the company s internal restructuring  aggregating million  had a material adverse effect on results of operations 
the total restructuring charges decreased by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to adjusting the original estimate of the loss to be incurred on the sale of land to the actual loss 
management continues to evaluate the company s cost structure in light of projected revenues and cash flows  both of which are variable and uncertain 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to undertake additional restructuring activities in the future  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
international revenues comprise a significant percentage of the company s total revenues  and the company may experience additional variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in foreign markets 
in particular  the company s third quarter tends to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity  particularly in europe 
in addition  variability and seasonality in the company s business may result from customer capital spending cycles  which tend to peak in the company s fourth quarter  and the company s sales incentive plans for sales personnel  which are measured on a calendar year basis

pursuant to delaware law  the company s certificate of incorporation  its bylaws and the indemnification agreements between the company and each of its current and former officers and directors  the company is obligated to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain liabilities arising from their employment with or service to the company 
these indemnification obligations require the company to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for any suit or other proceeding  threatened or actual  whether civil  criminal  administrative  investigative  appellate or any other type of proceeding  that arises as a result of any act or omission in the indemnitee s capacity as an officer or director of the company to the fullest extent permitted under delaware or any other applicable law 
the indemnification extends to any and all expenses including but not limited to attorneys fees and costs  and any other out of pocket expense and or liabilities of any type including but not limited to judgments  fines  excise taxes or penalties under erisa  and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of such proceedings 
the obligation to provide indemnification does not apply if the indemnitee is adjudicated to be liable for fraudulent or criminal conduct 
the company has purchased directors and officers liability insurance to reimburse it for the costs incurred in connection with its indemnification obligations described above 
for the period from august to august  the period in which most of the claims against the company and certain of its directors and officers were asserted  the company had in place three directors and officers liability insurance policies the and d o policies  each providing million in coverage for an aggregate of million 
the primary policy and first excess policy were issued by lloyds of london 
the second excess policy was issued by admiral insurance company 
the insurance carriers have taken the position that litigation filed after the policy periods of the and d o policies but arising from the same facts and circumstances as claims filed during the period from august to august  relates back to the and d o policies 
thus  the issuance carriers assert that actions filed after august do not implicate coverage under the company s d o insurance policies for the period august to august the current d o policies 
the current d o policies provide aggregate coverage of million  subject to various exclusions  including claims relating to the restatement of the company s financial reports 
the and d o policies provide that percent of the costs incurred in defending claims asserted jointly against the company and its current and former officers and directors are allocable to the individuals defense and  thus  are covered by the policy 
however  the and d o policies do not provide any separate coverage for the company 
moreover  the company does not have separate insurance to cover the costs of its own defense or to cover any liability for any claims asserted against it 
the company has not currently set aside any financial reserves relating to any of the above referenced actions 
in addition  in july  the securities and exchange commission issued a formal order of investigation of the company and certain unidentified individuals associated with the company with respect to non specified accounting matters  public disclosures and trading activity in the company s securities 
the company is cooperating with the investigation and is providing all information subpoenaed by the commission 
the pending federal and state securities actions are in the early stages of discovery 
consequently  at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate the damages  or the range of damages  that the company might incur in connection with such actions 
however  the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation can be expected to have an adverse impact on the company s business 
in particular  such litigation could impair the company s relationships with existing customers and its ability to obtain new customers 
defending such litigation will likely result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirors from bidding for the company or reducing the consideration such acquirors would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
dependence on key personnel  personnel changes  ability to recruit personnel the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting  marketing and management personnel 
in particular  the company is dependent upon a number of key management and technical personnel  including robert j 
finocchio  jr  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  jean yves f 
dexmier  the company s executive vice president and chief financial officer  and myron mike saranga  the company s senior vice president  product management and development 
mr 
finocchio and mr 
dexmier have only recently joined the company  and of the officers and key employees  only mr 
finocchio is bound by an employment agreement  the terms of which are nonetheless at will 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
since the beginning of  a number of senior management personnel and other key employees have departed the company  and to date  the company has been able to replace only some of the positions that have been vacated 
since the first quarter of  the company has experienced a significant number of voluntary resignations and has taken selective actions to reduce the number of employees in certain functional areas 
the company had approximately  regular employees at december   compared to approximately  at december  voluntary attrition has remained high across all functional areas 
in fiscal  the company experienced high attrition rates in its product development and sales groups and has had trouble attracting qualified replacement personnel 
the competition for employees in the software industry is intense  and the company expects that such competition will continue for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced difficulty in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications and believes that recent financial and business developments at the company have made recruitment more difficult 
in november  the company implemented an option repricing program in an effort to retain existing employees and  following further declines in the price of its common stock  announced a second repricing in december  which was effective in january there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in retaining existing employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  training and retaining qualified personnel  and the failure to do so  particularly in key functional areas such as product development and sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  new employees hired by the company generally require substantial training in the use and implementation of the company s products and in the company s procedures 
as a result  substantial employee turnover could have an adverse effect on results of operations in future quarters 
risks associated with preferred stock financings in august  the company raised net proceeds of million through the issuance of newly designated series a preferred 
in november  the company raised an additional million in net proceeds excluding of a million fee paid to a financial advisor of the company through the issuance of the series b preferred 
simultaneously with the closing of the series b preferred  the holders of the series a preferred exchanged all their outstanding shares of series a preferred for newly designated series a preferred  having substantially similar rights  preferences and privileges as the series a preferred with the exception of certain amendments  including revisions to the terms under which such shares become mandatorily redeemable 
while the issuance of the preferred stock in these transactions provided the company with additional working capital required to fund the company s continuing operations  the company s agreements with the purchasers of the series a preferred and the series b preferred contain covenants that could impair the company s ability to engage in various corporate transactions in the future  including financing transactions and certain transactions involving a change in control or acquisition of the company  or that could otherwise disadvantage the company and the holders of its common stock 
in particular  acquisitions of the company may not be affected without the consent of the holders of the outstanding preferred stock or without requiring the acquiring entity to assume the preferred stock or cause such preferred stock to be redeemed 
these provisions are likely to make an acquisition of the company more difficult and expensive and could discourage potential acquirors 
certain covenants of the company  made in connection with the issuance of the preferred stock  may also have the effect of limiting the company s ability to obtain additional financing by  for example  providing the holders of preferred stock certain rights of first offer and prohibiting the company from issuing additional preferred stock without the consent of such holders 
the terms of the financing agreements pursuant to which the preferred stock was issued also include certain penalty provisions that are triggered in the event the company fails to satisfy certain obligations 
in particular  the holders of the series a preferred will become entitled to an annual dividend of million  payable quarterly in cash  in the event the company fails to satisfy certain covenants  including the failure to have a registration statement covering the common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred declared effective by the commission within days of a registration request from the holders of series a preferred  the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the issuance of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred in the event that such approval becomes required by the rules of the nasdaq national market  and the failure to redeem any shares of series a preferred held by a holder of series a preferred who objects to a change in control transaction  if the transaction does not satisfy certain financial thresholds relating to the market capitalization and trading volume of any acquiring entity 
in the event the company becomes obligated to pay such dividends  the holders of the series a preferred will become immediately entitled to designate a number of members of the company s board of directors corresponding  as a percentage of the total number of members  to the percentage of the company s outstanding common stock held by such holders assuming the conversion into common stock of the outstanding series a preferred 
the holders of the series b preferred are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend at an annual rate of of the face value of each share of series b preferred  resulting in an aggregate annual dividend of million 
the dividend is generally payable upon the conversion of the series b preferred or redemption of the series b preferred and may be paid in cash or  at the company s election and subject to certain conditions  in shares of common stock 
in the event the holders of preferred stock become entitled to receive cash dividends or to have their preferred stock redeemed  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to fund such a payment or redemption  and even if funding is available  substantial dividend payments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see need for additional financing  customer financing and antitakeover protection 
both the series a preferred and the series b preferred are convertible into shares of the company s common stock based on the trading prices of the common stock during future periods that are described in the respective financing agreements 
the number of shares of common stock that may ultimately be issued upon conversion is therefore presently indeterminate 
if  in accordance with the terms of the financing agreements  the conversion price of the preferred stock is determined during a period when the trading price of the common stock is low  the resulting number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock could result in substantial dilution to the holders of common stock 
in addition  the company issued the series a warrant to the holders of the series a preferred to acquire up to an additional  shares of series a preferred for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series a warrant was exercised in part in february for  shares of series a preferred  resulting in million in net proceeds to the company 
in february  all  shares of series a preferred which were outstanding were converted into  shares of common stock 
the company is also obligated to issue the series b warrants upon conversion of the series b preferred 
the series a warrant and the series b warrants  to the extent exercised  will have a further dilutive effect 
competition  pricing risks the company faces intense competition in the market for rdbms software products 
the market for the company s products is subject to rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions and enhancements  and the company s competitors in the market include several large vendors that develop and market databases  applications  development tools or decision support products 
the company s principal competitors include computers associates  ibm  microsoft  ncr teradata  oracle and sybase 
several of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company 
any failure by the company to compete successfully with its existing competitors or future competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
several of the company s competitors have announced the development of enhanced versions of their principal database products that are intended to improve the performance or expand the capabilities of their existing products 
new or enhanced products by existing competitors or new competitors could result in greater price pressure on the company s products 
in addition  the industry movement to new operating systems  like windows nt  access through low end desktop computers  and access to data through the internet may cause downward pressure on prices of database software and related products 
the bundling of software products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy by certain of the company s competitors could also result in reductions in the price the company may charge for its products 
in addition  the company s own practices of bundling its software products for enterprise licenses or for promotional purposes with the company s partners could also result in reduction in the price the company may charge for its products 
in particular  the pricing strategies of competitors in the industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
if such downward pressure on prices were to occur  the company s operating margins would be adversely affected 
existing and future competition or changes in the company s product or service pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of the company s products or services 
if significant price reductions in the company s products or services were to occur and not be offset by increases in sales volume  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its existing competitors or will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
uncertain growth rates  technological change and new products over the last several years  the rdbms industry has expanded at significant growth rates  due in part to the continuing development of new technologies and products responsive to customer requirements 
recently  however  both industry analysts and competitors have predicted that such high growth rates will not be maintained in future periods 
recent instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets  which had previously been cited as a potentially strong source of revenue growth for relational database software companies  has introduced additional uncertainty concerning industry growth rates 
in the event industry growth rates should decline for any reason  the markets for the company s products would likely be adversely affected  which would have a negative impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality and international operations  currency fluctuations 
in addition  the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s growth and future financial performance will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet dynamic customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products or that such new or enhanced products will receive market acceptance or be delivered timely to the market 
the company s product development efforts are expected to continue to require substantial investments by the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the company has experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
delays in the scheduled availability or a lack of market acceptance of its products or failure to accurately anticipate customer demand and meet customer performance requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing  new products or new versions of existing products will not contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or commercial acceptance of such products 
a key determinative factor in the company s success will continue to be the ability of the company s products to operate and perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard application software products intended to be used in connection with rdbms 
failure to meet in a timely manner existing or future interoperability requirements of certain independent vendors could adversely affect the market for the company s products 
commercial acceptance of the company s products and services could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals concerning the company  its products  business or competitors or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or other factors that could affect consumer perception

in recent years  the types and quantities of data required to be stored and managed has grown increasingly complex and includes  in addition to conventional character data  audio  video  text  and three dimensional graphics in a high performance scalable environment 
during fiscal  the company invested substantial resources in developing its ordbms product line 
the market for products offering object relational database functionality is new and evolving  and its growth depends upon a growing need to store and manage complex data and on broader market acceptance of the company s products as a solution for this need 
as a result  there can be no assurance that organizations will choose to make the transition from conventional rdbms to ordbms 
delays in market acceptance of object relational database management products offered by the company could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition

international operations  currency fluctuations international sales represented approximately of total revenues for both fiscal and the company s international operations and financial results could be significantly affected by factors associated with international operations such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  as well as by other factors associated with international activities 
in particular  recent instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets  which accounted for approximately and of the company s total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results in future quarters 
most of the company s international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
although the company takes into account changes in exchange rates over time in its pricing strategy  it does so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  the sales cycles for the company s products is relatively long  depending on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
see fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality 
the company has implemented a foreign exchange hedging program consisting principally of the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts  which is intended to hedge the value of accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
this program involves the use of forward contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
the company has limited unhedged transaction exposures in certain secondary currencies in latin america  eastern europe and asia because there are limited forward currency exchange markets in these currencies 
the company does not attempt to hedge the translation to united states dollars of foreign denominated revenues and expenses not yet earned or incurred 
notwithstanding the company s efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that the company s hedging activities will adequately protect the company against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations

year impact on information technology budgets many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company has recently commenced a program  to be substantially completed by the fall of  to review the year compliance status of the software and systems used in its internal business processes  to obtain appropriate assurances of compliance from the manufacturers of these products and agreement to modify or replace all non compliant products 
in addition  the company is considering converting certain of its software and systems to commercial products that are known to be year compliant 
implementation of software products of third parties  however  will require the dedication of substantial administrative and management information resources  the assistance of consulting personnel from third party software vendors and the training of the company s personnel using such systems 
based on the information available to date  the company believes it will be able to complete its year compliance review and make necessary modifications prior to the end of software or systems which are deemed critical to the company s business are scheduled to be year compliant by the end of nevertheless  particularly to the extent the company is relying on the products of other vendors to resolve year issues  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience delays in implementing such products 
if key systems  or a significant number of systems were to fail as a result of year problems or the company were to experience delays implementing year compliant software products  the company could incur substantial costs and disruption of its business  which would potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company in its ordinary course of business tests and evaluates its own software products 
the company believes that its software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not materially affect the performance of the company s software products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability of such products to correctly create  store  process and output information related to such date data 
to the extent the company s software products are not fully year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all necessary software routines and codes necessary for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of data involving dates 
in addition  in certain circumstances  the company has warranted that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of the company s products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability to create  store  process and output information related to such data 
if any of the company s licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages against the company 
the company s license agreements in most cases limit liability to prevent unlimited exposure from such claims 
to date the company has not identified a separate budget for investigating and remedying issues related to year compliance whether involving the company s own software products or the software or systems used in its internal operations 
there can be no assurances that company resources spent on investigating and remedying year compliance issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement the company s success depends on proprietary technology 
to protect its proprietary rights  the company relies primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions contained in its license agreements and technical measures 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which provide only limited protection 
the company holds one united states patent and several pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering the company s inventions will issue or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
the company s products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
the company also relies on shrink wrap licenses  which include a notice informing the end user that  by opening the product packaging  the end user agrees to be bound by the company s license agreement printed on the package 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of its current or future products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in particular  the company has licensed the source code of its products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
the company has also entered source code escrow agreements with a number of its customers that generally require release of source code to the customer in the event of the company s bankruptcy  liquidation or otherwise ceasing to conduct business 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of the company s software is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and shrink wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is not aware that any of its software product offerings infringes the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to its current or future products 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business intellectual property 
product liability the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
antitakeover protections the company is authorized to issue  shares of undesignated preferred stock  of which  shares have been designated series a preferred  none of which is outstanding  of which  shares have been designated series a preferred  of which  shares were previously outstanding including  shares of series a preferred which were issued upon partial exercise of the series a warrant and converted into  shares of common stock in february and of which  shares remain issuable upon exercise of the series a warrant  and of which  shares have been designated series b preferred  of which  shares are outstanding 
subject to the prior consent of the holders of the series a preferred and the series b preferred  the board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof  including dividend rights  dividend rates  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting a series or the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by the company s stockholders 
to date  the company has used its ability to designate and issue new series of preferred stock in transactions intended to raise additional capital for the company 
the ability to issue additional shares of preferred stock  however  also provides desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes but could also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
in particular  certain rights  preferences and privileges of the series a preferred and series b preferred could have the effect of preventing or discouraging potential bids to acquire the company unless the terms of such acquisition are approved by such stockholders 
see risks associated with convertible preferred stock financings 
certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and specify certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
the board of directors of the company is divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
such provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of control of the company 
such provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability of the company to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the company s shares and  consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in the management of the company 
in addition  the company has adopted a rights agreement the rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which could also discourage potential acquirors 
the company is subject to section of the delaware general corporation law the antitakeover law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
the antitakeover law prevents certain delaware corporations  including those whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of the antitakeover law  a business combination includes  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving the company and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than of the company s assets 
in general  the antitakeover law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover law with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from amendments approved by the holders of at least a majority of the company s outstanding voting shares 
the company has not opted out of the provisions of the antitakeover law 
stock price volatility the market price of the company s common stock has in the past been highly volatile and is expected to continue to be subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in the future based on a number of factors  including market uncertainty about the company s financial condition or business prospects or the prospects for the rdbms market in general  shortfalls in the revenues or results of operations of the company or its principal competitors from revenues or results of operations expected by securities analysts  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of direct competitors of the company  changes in analysts estimates of the company s financial performance  the financial performance of competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the software industry  changes in prices for the company s products or competitors products  changes in revenue growth rates for the company  its competitors or the rdbms market in general  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal trends in technology purchases and other general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  which particularly affect the market for the securities of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future
