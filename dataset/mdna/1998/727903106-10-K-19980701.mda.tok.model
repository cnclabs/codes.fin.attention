contingencies the company is involved in certain litigation regarding the constitutionality of gaming facilities such as the maryland heights facility located upon artificial basins fed by the missouri river 
see part i  item  w 
todd akin  et al 
v 
missouri gaming commission 
based on the outcome of the november referendum and subsequent court proceedings  the possibility exists that the company could be forced either to remediate or close the maryland heights facility 
if either of these events occur  the company could incur substantial remediation costs or a substantial write down in asset values 
the amounts involved cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
each cruising riverboat is regulated by the us coast guard 
us coast guard regulations require that hulls of vessels of the type being operated by the company in lake charles and metropolis be inspected every five years at a us coast guard approved dry docking facility which will cause a temporary loss of service that could last one month or longer  unless the us coast guard determines that an alternative to dry docking is acceptable 
the next inspection is scheduled to occur in the fall of calendar for the lake charles star riverboat  the fall of calendar for the players iii lake charles riverboat  and the fall of calendar for the metropolis riverboat 
subject to us coast guard approval  the company is pursuing an underwater onsite inspection of the hull of the lake charles star riverboat as an alternative to dry docking 
an underwater hull inspection would likely involve a minimal disruption in operations  however  no assurance can be given that dry docking and the related loss of service will not be required 
year the year problem refers to the inability of computers and software programs to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year 
a system which is not year compliant would not be able to correctly process date based information  and in extreme situations  could cause entire systems to be disabled 
during fiscal  the company began evaluating its various systems and applications to determine whether or not those systems and applications were year compliant 
the process involves system reviews  testing  and modification or replacement of date sensitive hardware and software 
to date  an inventory of systems has been completed 
based upon this review  the company has identified the major systems which are not compliant and has implemented a plan of action to replace or update those systems 
the plan calls for completion of any identified systems or application changes or upgrades connected with year compliance before december  the total cost to the company for its year compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results from operations
