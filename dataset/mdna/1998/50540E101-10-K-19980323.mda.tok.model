the insurance segment increased due to an increase in the total number of insurance applicants tested and an increase in kit revenue  partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per applicant

trends the following is management s analysis of certain existing trends that have been identified as potentially affecting the future financial results of the company 
due to the potential for a rapid rate of change in any number of factors associated with the insurance and healthcare laboratory testing industries  it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty labone s future volumes  sales or net earnings 
the insurance laboratory testing industry continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing 
labone continues to maintain its market leadership by providing quality products and services at competitive prices 
management expects that prices may continue to decline during due to competitive pressures 
this trend may have a material impact on earnings from operations 
currently  there are approximately million individual life insurance policies sold in the united states annually 
however  laboratory services are provided on only approximately million of these policy applicants 
during  the fda approved an oral fluid western blot test as a confirmation for the oral fluid hiv antibody test 
the noninvasive nature of oral specimen collection allows for lower cost collection  making testing much more affordable on smaller face value insurance policies 
due to the lower collection expense associated with oral fluid collection devices  the potential exists for an expansion of the testing market 
the total number of insurance applicants tested by labone increased in from the prior year 
approximately one half of the increase represented oral fluid hiv tested applicants 
oral fluid tested applicants are expected to further increase in effective january   labone acquired certain assets  including customer lists  of gib laboratories  inc  a subsidiary of prudential insurance company of america 
concurrently  prudential s individual insurance group agreed to use labone as its exclusive provider of risk assessment testing services 
at the time of the purchase  gib served approximately of the insurance laboratory testing market

approximately  bluecare members are covered by the program 
labone originally announced that the bluecare program covered approximately  lives 
to date  our laboratory benefit management programs  including bluecare and the lab card program  have more than million lives enrolled with more than  additional lives awaiting implementation 
labone is actively addressing year computer concerns 
the company has established an oversight committee which includes management from all parts of the company and meets periodically to review progress 
the company expects to complete all internal year objectives by the end of and is assessing the year preparation and contingency plans of its clients and vendors 
total expenses related to this project are not expected to be material to the company 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
both are effective for the company s fiscal year ending december   and retroactive application will be required 
the company does not expect these statements to have a significant effect on reported earning or segment disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources labone s working capital position declined from million at december   to million at december  this decrease is the result of dividends paid  capital additions and the purchase of gib assets exceeding net cash provided by operations 
net cash provided by operations during increased from million in to million in during  labone paid quarterly dividends of per common share 
the board of directors reviews this policy on a periodic basis 
the total amount of dividends paid during was per share  or million 
although cash dividends paid currently exceed net cash provided by operations  there are no immediate restrictions that would limit the company s ability to make future dividend payments 
during  the company invested million in additional property  plant and equipment and the purchase of certain assets and customer lists of gib laboratories  inc  as compared to million in and million in of the amount spent in  approximately million was for the gib purchase  and approximately million was for land acquisition and initial development costs to construct the company s new facility 
the new facility project is expected to cost approximately million and is expected to be primarily financed with an industrial revenue bond approved by the city of lenexa kansas in august the irb is expected to be in place during the second quarter other capital asset purchases are expected to be consistent with prior years 
the company had no short term borrowings during management expects to be able to fund operations and future dividend payments from a combination of cash flow from operations and cash reserves 
proceeds from the industrial revenue bond will be used to finance the construction of the company s new facility 
interest on the bond will be based on a taxable seven day variable rate which would have been less than seven percent as of march  the company expects to repay the bond over years at million per year plus interest 
total cash and investments at december   were million  as compared to million at december
