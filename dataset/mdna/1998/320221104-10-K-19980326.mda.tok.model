item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the results of operations of first financial corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  first bank and trust company company  depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest earning assets and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the senior debenture 
the company s net income is also affected by its level of noninterest income  including fees and service charges  as well as by its noninterest expenses  such as salary and employee benefits  provisions to the allowance for possible loan losses  occupancy costs and  when necessary  expenses related to other real estate owned oreo and to the administration of non performing and other classified assets 
the company reported net income for of  as compared to  for  or an increase of 
diluted earnings per share amounted to per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to 
per share for  based on  weighted average shares outstanding 
also  in  the company s return on average assets roa improved to from 
in the company s return on average equity roe was in  compared with in the improvement in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a reduction in the provision for possible loan losses  which were offset somewhat by a decrease in noninterest income  and an increase in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes 
in general  the company s improvement in earnings is attributable to its ability to i increase average interest earning assets funded from the net proceeds of the public offering  along with deposits and other borrowings  ii increase loan originations  and iii improved asset quality 
results of operations net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the single largest contributor to the company s results of operations 
in  net interest income rose  or  to  from  in the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in interest earning assets of million  or  offset somewhat by a basis point decrease in average net interest spread to in  as compared to in the increase in average interest earning assets was funded largely from the net proceeds of the public offering  deposit growth and other borrowings 
increases in average stockholders equity and an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits  accounted for a decrease in average net interest margin of only basis points to in as compared to the basis point decrease in net interest spread 
interest income totaled  in  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the million increase in average interest earning assets was primarily responsible for the improvement in interest income 
during  loan demand was solid 
nonetheless  the composition of loans to average interest earning assets decreased to during  from during this decrease was primarily the result of the purchase of nearly million in mortgage backed securities in the latter part of these securities which were placed in the company s available for sale investment portfolio  produced yields which were lower than the blended yield on average interest earning assets 
consequently  despite a relatively stable interest rate environment  the slight change in the mix of average interest earning assets accounted for a basis point reduction in average earning asset yield to in from in interest expense amounted to  in  an increase of  or over the  reported in this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  and a basis point increase in cost of funds to during  from during of the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  average time deposits increased million and average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million 
lower cost now  savings and money market deposits decreased million 
the increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase was used to fund the purchase of the mortgage backed securities 
despite the gathering of new deposits and the shifting of existing deposits into higher cost time deposits  the company s cost of funds would have remained flat at in both and were it not for the increase in volume and rate of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated

miscellaneous total noninterest expense in  was  as compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the largest expense items accounting for this increase were the  increase in salaries and employee benefits  the  increase in occupancy and equipment expense  the  increase in computer service fees and  the  increase in legal and professional fees 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in oreo carrying and disposition costs and a  decrease in advertising 
salaries and benefits increased  or in this increase reflected an increase in staffing levels associated with the june opening of the in store branch in wal mart in north kingstown  rhode island 
during the number of full time equivalent employees reached a high of from at the beginning of the year 
also  effective january   the company adopted a matching savings incentive plan  also known as a k plan  which increased benefit costs by  during the company undertook two major projects  namely  the opening of the north kingstown branch  and an upgrade of its voice and data communications systems 
these projects account for the  increase in occupancy expense through the incurrence of rental expense and the amortization of leasehold improvements 
the upgrade in communication systems involved the purchase of state of the art computer hardware and licensing of software applications 
depreciation charges associated with these capital expenditures accounted for the increase of  in equipment expense 
the state of the art processing capabilities and overall enhancement of information systems was primarily responsible for the  increase in computer service fees 
represented the first full year in which the company operated in a publicly held and publicly traded environment 
in connection therewith  the company incurred typical legal and professional fees related to this public environment 
these fees included costs associated with preparation and production of public filings and shareholder reports  listing fees  annual meeting costs  transfer agent costs  and other similar costs 
for this reason  legal and professional fees increased  in oreo carrying and disposition costs decreased  primarily due to the elimination of the need to write down the property s carrying value in  compared to a  write down in  along with a decrease in the foreclosed property portfolio from an average of  during to an average of  during other increases or decreases in general and administrative expenses  including advertising  were largely due to the company s increased item processing  greater efficiency and productivity  and decisions to increase or curtail discretionary programs  projects and spending 
income taxes income tax expense amounted to  in  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate in was 
the company s combined federal and state net of federal benefit statutory income tax rate was in and the company s effective combined federal and state tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the exclusion from state taxable income interest income on us treasury obligations and certain government agency debt securities in and and  the utilization of a capital loss carryforward in deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
financial condition total assets the company s total assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in total assets primarily occurred within the company s loan portfolio which increased million 
the remainder of the increase took place within premises and equipment which increased 
million 
the primary funding sources for the rise in total assets were i million increase in total deposits  ii nearly million in net income  less dividends paid  offset by iii 
million decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
investment securities the company s total investment securities portfolio decreased million to million at december   from million at december  at december   securities which were classified as held to maturity were carried at amortized cost of  with a market value of  securities classified as available for sale were carried at a market value of  with an amortized cost of  at december   government agency debt securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were classified as held to maturity which is consistent with the company s intent and ability 
the available for sale segment of investment securities was comprised of us treasury securities  government agency discount notes and mortgage backed securities 
the securities in which the company may invest are subject to regulation and  for the most part  are limited to securities which are considered investment grade securities 
in addition  the company has an internal investment policy which restricts investments to i united states treasury securities  ii obligations of united states government agencies and corporations  iii collateralized mortgage obligations  including securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the government national mortgage association gnma  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  iv securities of states and political subdivisions  v corporate debt  all of which must be considered investment grade by a recognized rating service  and vi corporate stock 
in addition to achieving a rate of return which is consistent with the overall risk profile of the investment portfolio  the company views the immediate purpose of its investment securities as a ready source of liquidity and as a management tool against interest rate risk embedded within the company s balance sheet 
generally  the company invests in fixed rate government and agency obligations with a maturity not to exceed two years 
single index floating rate or step up securities generally have final maturities which do not exceed five years at time of purchase 
consequently  the company s exposure to significant market swings is somewhat controlled 
at december   the company s investment securities had net unrealized gains of  as compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  during  the company sold an investment security which was classified as available for sale at a gain of  in order to utilize a capital loss tax carryforward which was scheduled to expire at the end of nonetheless  despite this sales transaction and the segmentation of its securities portfolio  the company anticipates that it will hold all securities for their intended purpose 
loans total loans  net of unearned discount  amounted to million at december   up million  or  from million at the end of the increase in total loans was predominately in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio  which grew million  while residential real estate  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans declined million 
at december   total loans represented of total assets and of total deposits compared to and  respectively  at the end of at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial    commercial real estate    residential real estate    home equity lines of credit 
   consumer    unearned discount allowance for possible loan losses    net loans    in  the company encountered solid loan demand from small businesses 
the company believes a primary reason for this demand was the desire of small business borrowers to seek banking relationships with banks which were responsive to their needs  and the success of the company in meeting those needs 
the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans reflected the company s renewed emphasis on i small business lending  ii obtaining loan guarantees from the sba  and iii cash flow analysis and an overall assessment of the borrower s financial strength and ability to repay with a secondary view towards collateral values 
the bank offers a full range of consumer lending products including residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  new and used automobile loans  passbook and certificate of deposit loans  and other personal secured and unsecured loans 
although the bank makes an effort to price these loans competitively  it faces substantial competition from mortgage and consumer finance companies 
non performing assets non performing assets include non performing loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the non performing loans category includes loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when the collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  or when payments of principal or interest have become days past due and have arrearages that have not been eliminated 
in certain instances  non performing loans may also include loans that have become days past due but remain on accrual status because the value of the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
in addition to the preceding two categories  the company may  under appropriate circumstances  restructure loans as a concession to a borrower 
at december    and no troubled debt restructurings were included in the company s loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth information regarding non performing assets and delinquent loans days past due as to interest or principal  and held by the company at the dates indicated 
the amounts and ratios shown are exclusive of the loans and allowance for possible loan losses acquired in the chariho exeter credit union acquisition

assessing the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors are i the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  ii the quality of specific loans  iii the level of non accruing loans  iv current economic conditions  v trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and vi the value of the underlying collateral 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates 
the company reviews non performing and performing loans to ascertain whether any impairment exists within the loan portfolio 
the company evaluates these problem loans and estimates the potential loss exposure when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
because the allowance for possible loan losses is based on various estimates and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in general economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the following table is an analysis of the allowance for possible loan losses over the last three years 
this table excludes the acquired loans and related allowance

commercial real estate deposits and borrowings the company devotes considerable time and resources to gathering deposits through its retail branch network system 
total deposits increased million  or  to million at december   from million at the end of total demand deposits increased million  while savings and money market accounts increased 
million 
the preponderance of deposit growth occurred within time deposits which increased million 
of this increase  one year time deposits grew million while the company s and month variable rate certificate of deposit decreased million 
the company s depositors  concerned that interest rates would decline in the near term  shifted their deposits from the longer term variable deposit product to the shorter term fixed rate deposit product 
the opening of the bank s new in store branch in the north kingstown wal mart store in june did not significantly contribute to the growth in the bank s deposits in management believes that this was the case because the new de novo branch was not opened until half way through the year and the fact that the area of north kingstown where the wal mart store is located is still largely under development 
along with its deposit gathering efforts  the company relied on borrowing from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to leverage its capital 
at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to million  compared to million at december  asset liability management the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management is to minimize interest rate risk on net interest income and stockholders equity 
this objective is accomplished by managing the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee which includes members of the company s senior management and two members of the company s board of directors 
the asset liability management committee is actively involved in formulating the economic assumptions that the company uses in its financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor the company s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities is analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the company has historically sought to maintain a relatively narrow gap position and has  in some instances  foregone investment in higher yielding assets where such investment  in management s opinion  exposed the company to undue interest rate risk 
however  the company does not attempt to perfectly match interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and will selectively mismatch its assets and liabilities to a controlled degree where it considers it both appropriate and prudent to do so 
in managing its interest rate risk exposure  the company does not engage in derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
other than fixed rate loan commitments  the company is prohibited  by internal policy  from engaging in the use of off balance sheet financial instruments 
there are a number of relevant time periods in which to measure the company s gap position  such as at the   and month points and beyond in the maturity schedule 
management tends to focus most closely on the gap up to the one year point in making its principal funding and investing decisions 
the following table presents the repricing schedule for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  within over three over one over five three to twelve year to years to over ten months months five years ten years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities purchased under agreements to resell  and other 
  investment securities

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
by using simulation modeling techniques  the company is able to measure its interest rate risk exposure as determined by the impact of sudden movements in interest rates on net interest income and equity 
this exposure is termed earnings at risk and equity at risk 
at december   the company s earnings at risk under a plus minus basis point interest rate shock test measured a negative in a worst case scenario 
under a similar test  the company s equity at risk measured a negative of market value of equity at december  at december   the company s earnings at risk and equity at risk fell well within tolerance levels established by internal policy 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to earning enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace 
primary sources of liquidity consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  maturity of investment securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
these sources fund the bank s lending and investment activities 
at december   cash and due from banks  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and short term investments unpledged and maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets 
through membership in the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb  the company has access to both short and long term borrowings of nearly million  which could assist the company in meeting its liquidity needs and funding its asset mix 
at december   the company held state and municipal demand deposits of million which it considered highly volatile 
nonetheless  the company believes that there are no adverse trends in the company s liquidity or capital reserves  and the company believes that it maintains adequate liquidity to meet its commitments 
capital resources total stockholders equity of the company at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the increase of million primarily resulted from million in net income  less dividends declared 
the bank is subject to the leverage and risk based capital ratio requirements of the fdic 
the bank is deemed to be well capitalized by the fdic and is classified as such for fdic insurance assessment purposes 
at december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the fdic s minimum leverage capital ratio for adequately capitalized financial institutions is  although this minimum leverage ratio applies only to certain of the most highly rated banks 
other institutions are subject to higher requirements 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
according to these standards  the bank had a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december   as compared to a tier i risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  the minimum risk based tier i and total capital ratios at each of these dates were and  respectively 
the capital structure of the company is subject to the capital ratio requirements of the federal reserve bank  which happens to be the same requirements which fdic imposes on the bank 
at december   the company s leverage capital ratio was  as compared to at december  the company s tier i risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was at december   and and  respectively  at december  year compliance the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its computer software programs and operating systems 
virtually all of these programs and systems are furnished  supported and maintained by correspondent institutions  computer service and system providers  and software vendors 
as the year approaches  a critical business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate this date value 
as a result  the year could be the maximum date value these systems will be able to accurately process 
operating in a highly regulated environment  the company and the bank are well aware of the importance placed on this issue by the federal deposit insurance corporation  federal reserve bank  rhode island department of business regulation and the securities and exchange commission 
the company has adopted a year plan which calls for completion of a risk assessment  identification  reprogramming and testing of all programs and systems no later than december  further  the plan also requires all programs and systems to be fully tested and year compliant by june  the company is in constant communication with its outside vendors  with whom it is reliant  to ensure that their timetable and progress is consistent with that of the company 
the company does not anticipate that the costs to be incurred in connection with year compliance will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
comparison of with the company reported net income for of  as compared to  for  or an increase of 
the improvement in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income  a reduction in the provision for possible loan losses  and an increase in noninterest income  all of which were offset somewhat by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes 
in general  the company s improvement in earnings is attributable to its ability to i increase interest earning assets funded from the net proceeds of the public offering  along with deposits and other borrowings  ii increase loan originations  iii improve net interest margins  and iv improve asset quality 
during  the company completed a public offering of its common stock and issued  shares while increasing stockholders equity by million 
the increased capital allowed the company to grow its balance sheet without impairing its capital position 
total assets increased million or to million at the end of this growth occurred through a million  or increase in deposits  to million  a million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the million in net proceeds from the public offering  and nearly 
million in net income  less common stock dividends 
net interest income in  net interest income rose  or  to  from  in the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in average interest earing assets of million  or and a slight increase in average net interest spread to in  as compared to in the increase in average earning assets was funded largely from the net proceeds of the public offering  deposit growth and other borrowings 
increases in average stockholders equity  offset somewhat by a decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits  coupled with a relatively flat average net interest spread accounted for the basis point increase in average net interest margin to in interest income totaled  in  an increase of  or over the prior year 
the million increase in average interest earning assets was primarily responsible for the improvement in interest income 
during  loan demand was solid and the composition of average interest earning assets between loans and investments remained relatively constant from to the interest rate environment also remained relatively flat  resulting in an basis point increase in average earnings asset yield to in from in interest expense amounted to  in  an increase of  or over the  reported in the increase was attributable to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a basis point increase in average cost of funds 
during  average interest bearing demand and now  savings  and money market deposits decreased million while higher cost average time deposits increased million 
also  higher cost securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased on average by million 
despite the impact of a declining short term interest rate environment  the shifting of existing core savings deposits into higher cost time deposits along with gathering new deposits into higher cost time deposits accounted for the increase in average cost of funds to in from in in the latter part of  the company entered into a series of contracts to sell securities under agreements to repurchase 
the proceeds from these agreements were used to purchase  of mortgage backed securities with a yield of  at an average borrowing cost of 
the purpose of this transaction was to leverage the company s capital position with the intent to ultimately increase the company s return on stockholders equity 
although the transaction added nearly  to net interest income in  the spreads from this sole transaction were narrower than from the company s other investing and financing activities 
consequently  the net interest spread and net interest margin would have been and  respectively  without this single transaction 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses was  in  compared to  in the reduction in the provision was primarily the result of fewer net charge offs during  thus eliminating the necessity to replenish the reserve for net charge offs  which was the case in due to the overall improvement in asset quality  net charge offs amounted to  in  compared to  in the provision for possible loan losses was used primarily to allow for the overall growth of the company s portfolio 
noninterest income noninterest income increased  in  to  from  in this increase primarily was due to a  gain on sale of securities 
generally  the company s intention is not to sell securities prior to maturity 
however  in order to utilize a capital loss tax carryforward  which was scheduled to expire at the end of  a security was sold and the tax carryforward was utilized 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased  or  to  primarily as a result of more stringent imposition of fees  revisions to the fee schedule of various deposit products and  growth in the company s total deposits 
the gain on sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans decreased  in largely due to the increased competition in this business market 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense in was  as compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the largest expense items accounting for this increase were the  increase in salaries and employee benefits  the  increase in legal and professional fees and  the  increase in advertising costs 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in oreo carrying and disposition costs and a  decrease in fdic insurance premiums 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or in this increase reflected a general pay adjustment for nearly all employees  and higher payroll taxes  health insurance and retirement benefit costs 
the increase was offset somewhat by an increase in deferred loan origination costs and a decrease in full time equivalent staffing from at the beginning of the year to at the end of oreo carrying and disposition costs declined  or solely as a result of a decrease in the oreo portfolio which declined nearly  or 
in  the company s fdic insurance assessment decreased  effective january  the bank s annual fdic insurance assessment was reduced to the minimum statutory requirement 
the bank qualified for this rate on the basis of its strong capital position and supervisory evaluation 
legal and professional fees rose  or in this increase was attributable to fees typically incurred in connection with reporting requirements applicable to public companies  along with professional fees associated with an assessment and evaluation of the company s voice and data processing and communications systems 
other increases or decreases in general and administrative expenses  including advertising  were largely due to the company s increased item processing  greater efficiency and productivity  and decisions to increase or curtail discretionary programs  projects and spending 
income taxes income tax expense amounted to  in  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate in was 
the company s combined federal and state net of federal benefit statutory income tax rate was in and in the company s effective combined federal and state tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward in and  the exclusion from state taxable income interest income on us treasury obligations and certain government agency debt securities in and item a
