item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
recent events on march   the company announced several changes in its executive management structure which will be effective march  robert e 
rose resigned as president and chief executive officer and a director of the company to pursue another opportunity

results of operations general revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of mobilization  however  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig which was previously stacked  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
the company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
operating income 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses are not affected by changes in dayrates  nor are they necessarily significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  the company realizes few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income associated with loss of revenues 
the company recognizes as an operating expense activities such as painting  inspections and routine overhauls that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
from time to time  the company sells assets in the ordinary course of its business and gains or losses associated with such sales are included in operating income 
merger with arethusa 
effective april   the arethusa merger was completed 
arethusa owned a fleet of mobile offshore drilling rigs  operated two additional mobile offshore drilling rigs pursuant to bareboat charters  and provided drilling services worldwide to international and government controlled oil and gas companies 
because the arethusa merger was accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting purposes  results of operations include those of arethusa from the effective date of the arethusa merger 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its integrated services and intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings 
during november  july  march  and september  the company completed its major upgrades of the ocean victory  the ocean clipper i  the ocean star  and the ocean quest  respectively  expanding these rigs to have fourth generation capabilities 
upon completion  these rigs are included in fourth generation semisubmersibles for discussion purposes prior period information will continue to include these rigs in other semisubmersibles 
year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenues fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services    land   other   eliminations    total revenues    contract drilling expense fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services    land   other   eliminations    total contract drilling expense    operating income fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services   land   other   eliminations    depreciation and amortization expense    general and administrative expense    gain on sale of assets    total operating income    revenues 
the million increase in revenues from fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted  in part  from a million increase in revenues generated by the ocean victory  the ocean clipper i  the ocean star  and the ocean quest upon completion of their upgrade projects in november  july  march  and september  respectively 
however  utilization of the ocean clipper i was less than expected due to subsea system equipment difficulties 
also  improvements in dayrates in the gulf of mexico and the north sea contributed million of additional revenue and increased utilization in the north sea contributed million of additional revenue during the year ended december  the million increase in revenues from other semisubmersibles resulted primarily from million of additional revenue for improvements in dayrates in the average operating dayrate for other semisubmersibles was  per day in  as compared to  per day in also  million of additional revenue was generated primarily by the inclusion of operating results for the eight semisubmersibles acquired in the arethusa merger for twelve months in as compared to the inclusion of only eight months in in addition  an increase of million in revenue resulted primarily from improved utilization in for several rigs that were either relocating or undergoing repairs necessary for new contracts or locations in early the million increase in revenues from jack ups resulted primarily from improvements in dayrates  which contributed million of additional revenue 
the average operating dayrate for jack ups was  per day in as compared to  per day in in addition  the inclusion of operating results for the jack up rigs acquired in the arethusa merger for twelve months in as compared to the inclusion of only eight months in resulted in million of additional revenue 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million due to downtime incurred in late for a regulatory inspection and leg reinforcement upgrade on the ocean tower and leg reinforcements and other modifications on the ocean titan 
the million increase in revenues from integrated services resulted from an increase in project management service revenue during as compared to the prior year 
the million decrease in land revenues resulted from the sale of the company s land drilling assets in december other revenues of million were generated by the polyconfidence  a semisubmersible accommodation vessel purchased in may see capital resources 
contract drilling expense 
the million increase in contract drilling expense for fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted primarily from additional operating expense of million from the ocean victory  the ocean clipper i  the ocean star  and the ocean quest  which was generated upon completion of their major upgrades 
also  the ocean valiant recognized increased expenses in late in preparation for its relocation from the gulf of mexico to west africa 
the million increase for other semisubmersibles resulted primarily from million of additional costs generated by the semisubmersibles acquired in the arethusa merger 
these additional costs were primarily due to the inclusion of operating results for these rigs for twelve months in as compared to the inclusion of only eight months in also  higher operating costs incurred in connection with the reactivation of the ocean century to work in the gulf of mexico and regulatory inspections and associated repairs on the ocean saratoga in early and the ocean general in late resulted in increased contract drilling expense as compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately million due to the reclassification of operations for the ocean clipper i to fourth generation semisubmersibles upon completion of its upgrade in july the sale of the ocean zephyr  a semisubmersible located offshore brazil  in also reduced expenses by million as compared to the million increase in jack up expense resulted primarily from the rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  regulatory inspections and associated repairs on the ocean scotian  the ocean crusader  and the ocean king  and leg reinforcement and other modifications on the ocean titan 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million resulting from the termination of the bareboat charter agreement in for the bonito ii  a jack up rig previously operated by the company 
the million increase in expenses for integrated services resulted primarily from increased intercompany rates charged for rigs utilized in project management services offset in eliminations during as compared to the million decrease in land expense resulted from the sale of the company s land drilling assets in december other contract drilling expense increased million primarily due to expenses associated with crew training programs for new employees and certain non recurring charges in and non recurring credits recognized in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  increased primarily due to additional expense for i the eight semisubmersibles and three jack up drilling rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  ii goodwill amortization expense associated with the arethusa merger  iii rig upgrades completed in and  iv capital expenditures associated with the company s continuing rig enhancement program  and v the polyconfidence  which was acquired in may see capital resources 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  primarily due to i additional overhead resulting from the arethusa merger  ii increased accruals for the company s employee bonus and retention plan  and iii increased legal fees associated with various legal matters 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the increased accruals for the employee bonus and retention plan resulted from a higher bonus pool for the performance year and from additional participants in the plan 
gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the gain associated with the sale of the ocean zephyr  a semisubmersible drilling rig located offshore brazil 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of all of the operational assets of diamond m onshore  inc  the company s wholly owned land drilling subsidiary  resulting in a gain of million 
also during  the company sold two shallow water jack up drilling rigs  the ocean magallanes and the ocean conquest  and one semisubmersible  the ocean zephyr ii  resulting in gains totaling million 
interest income 
interest income of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the accretion of discounts and interest earned on investments of excess cash primarily generated by the issuance of the notes 
see liquidity 
interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million interest on the notes  partially offset by million interest capitalized to major upgrades 
interest expense for the year ended december  included million of origination costs  including costs previously capitalized  which were expensed in connection with the restructuring of a revolving credit facility during december see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year 
this change resulted primarily from the increase of million in the company s income before income tax expense and a reduction in income tax expense during the prior year 
in  benefits for utilization of previously unrecorded net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction were recognized  which contributed to the reduction in income tax expense 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its integrated services and intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings 
during september  the company completed its major upgrade of the ocean quest  expanding the rig to have fourth generation capabilities 
upon completion  the ocean quest is included in fourth generation semisubmersibles for discussion purposes prior period information will continue to include the rig in other semisubmersibles 
the company s drillship  ocean clipper i  is included in other semisubmersibles for discussion purposes 
year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenues fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services    land    other eliminations    total revenues    contract drilling expense fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services   land    other   eliminations    total contract drilling expense    operating income fourth generation semisubmersibles    other semisubmersibles    jack ups    integrated services    land    other   eliminations   depreciation and amortization expense    general and administrative expense    gain on sale of assets    total operating income    revenues 
the million increase in revenues from fourth generation semisubmersibles resulted from improvements in dayrates million and increases in utilization million 
the improvement in utilization for was partially attributable to the relocation of two fourth generation rigs during the prior year  reducing the days worked for these rigs during that period 
the million increase in revenues from other semisubmersibles was primarily attributable to million of revenues from the eight semisubmersibles acquired in the arethusa merger and increases in dayrates in both the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
the million increase in revenues from jack ups resulted primarily from revenues associated with rigs acquired in the arethusa merger and improvements in dayrates in the gulf of mexico 
the million increase in revenues from integrated services resulted from an increase in project management service revenue during as compared to the prior year 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for fourth generation semisubmersibles increased million primarily due to the completion of the major upgrade of the ocean quest which  beginning in september  was included as a fourth generation semisubmersible as compared to the prior year 
the million increase for other semisubmersibles resulted from the additional rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  increased expenses for shipyard repairs on three rigs  and increased expenses attributable to improved utilization during these increases were partially offset by a reduction in local payroll expenses resulting from the relocation of a rig and decreased expenses for a rig undergoing a major upgrade during the million increase in jack up expense resulted primarily from the rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  partially offset by decreased operating expenses for two rigs which were cold stacked during one of which was sold in july 
integrated services expense was relatively unchanged from the prior year 
other contract drilling expense decreased million primarily due to collections from a settlement in connection with a lawsuit and collections on accounts receivable written off in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  increased primarily due to additional expense for i the eight semisubmersibles and three jack up drilling rigs acquired in the arethusa merger  ii goodwill amortization expense associated with the arethusa merger  iii three rig upgrades completed in  and iv capital expenditures associated with the company s continuing rig enhancement program 
partially offsetting these increases was a change in accounting estimate to increase the estimated useful lives for certain classes of rigs 
this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately million  as compared to the year ended december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased due to the arethusa merger  however  these increases were partially offset by cost savings in rent due to the february purchase of the building in which the company has its corporate headquarters 
in addition  approximately million of general and administrative expense associated with the major upgrades of the ocean quest  the ocean star  the ocean victory and the ocean clipper i was capitalized to these projects during gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the sale of all of the operational assets of diamond m onshore  inc  the company s wholly owned land drilling subsidiary  resulting in a gain of million 
in addition  the company sold two shallow water jack up drilling rigs  the ocean magallanes and the ocean conquest  and one semisubmersible  the ocean zephyr ii  resulting in gains totaling million 
interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million to expense origination costs  including costs previously capitalized  in connection with the restructuring of a revolving credit facility during december the decrease from million for the prior year was attributable to a reduction in outstanding indebtedness resulting from the repayment of the company s loan from loews in connection with the company s initial public offering 
in addition  interest costs associated with the company s financing arrangements were capitalized with respect to qualified construction projects during income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year 
this change resulted primarily from the increase of million in the company s income before income tax expense  partially offset by the recognition of benefits for utilization of previously unrecorded net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in in addition  during the year ended december   the company s tax benefit reflected the effects of profits in foreign jurisdictions where the company s tax liability was minimal 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
outlook the company continues to benefit from increased demand and from the recent tight supply of major offshore drilling rigs worldwide 
these conditions are due  in part  to the increasing impact of technological advances  including d seismic  horizontal drilling  and subsea completion procedures  on oil and gas exploration and development economics 
to address the current tight supply situation  customers seek to contract rigs for term commitments as opposed to contracts for the drilling of a single well or a group of wells in many cases  and often will pay for upgrades and modifications necessary for more challenging drilling locations in order to assure rig availability 
the company seeks to have a foundation of long term contracts with a reasonable balance of short term or well to well contracts to minimize risk while participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market 
the company continues to enhance its fleet to meet customer demand for diverse drilling capabilities  including those required for deep water and harsh environment operations 
in march  the company completed the major upgrade of the ocean star to fourth generation capabilities and the rig began a three year commitment in the deep water market of the gulf of mexico 
in july  the ocean clipper i began a four year contract in the deep water market of the gulf of mexico following its upgrade project 
the ocean victory  previously stacked in the north sea  completed modifications in connection with its three year deep water drilling program in the gulf of mexico which began in november in addition  the company began the conversion of the polyconfidence  a semisubmersible accommodation vessel  in connection with a five year commitment in the gulf of mexico anticipated to begin in late in february  a fire was detected in the engine room of the ocean victory  which was operating in the gulf of mexico 
although the fire was contained and extinguished  damage was done to the power and electrical systems aboard the rig 
in march  the rig was dockside in mobile  alabama for further damage evaluation 
until that process is completed  the company is unable to determine how long the rig will be under repair 
it is possible that the repair period could remove the rig from service for a significant portion of the company expects that its insurance will cover the repairs  but the loss of revenue during the repair period is not covered by insurance 
as a result  the loss of such revenues will reduce the company s results of operations for the ability to minimize costs and downtime is critical to the company s results of operations 
the improved opportunities for the offshore contract drilling industry worldwide have resulted in increased demand for and a shortage of experienced personnel and equipment  including drill pipe and riser  necessary on offshore drilling rigs 
the company does not consider the shortage of such personnel and equipment currently to be a material factor in its business 
however  because of the increased demand for oil field services  a significant increase in costs  including compensation and training  is likely to occur if present trends continue for an extended period 
in addition  because of periodic inspections required by certain regulatory agencies  of the company s rigs will be in the shipyard for a portion of the company intends to focus on returning these rigs to operations as soon as reasonably possible  in order to minimize the downtime and associated loss of revenues 
in addition  the recent improvement in the current results of operations and prospects for the offshore contract drilling industry as a whole has led to increased rig construction and enhancement programs by the company s competitors 
a significant increase in the supply of technologically advanced rigs capable of drilling in deep water may have an adverse effect on the average operating dayrates for the company s rigs  particularly its more advanced semisubmersible units  and on the overall utilization level of the company s fleet 
in such case  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected 
the offshore contract drilling industry historically has been highly competitive and cyclical and  although not currently a material factor in the company s markets  weak commodity prices  economic problems in countries outside the united states  or a number of other influencing factors could curtail spending by oil and gas companies and possibly depress the offshore drilling industry 
therefore  the company cannot predict whether and  if so  to what extent current market conditions will continue 
liquidity at december   cash and short term investments totaled million  up from million at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by million to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from the arethusa merger and completion of upgrade projects 
investing activities used million in cash during the year ended december   as compared to million during the prior year 
in may  the company purchased the polyconfidence  a semisubmersible accommodation vessel  for approximately million in cash 
see capital resources 
in addition  the company purchased us treasury securities  equity securities  and also invested excess cash under repurchase agreements with third parties  primarily major brokerage firms  for a set rate of return 
capital expenditures also increased substantially during as the company continued to invest in major upgrades of its existing fleet 
cash provided by financing activities for increased million to million  as compared to million of cash provided by financing activities for sources of financing during the year ended december  consisted primarily of the company s issuance of the notes  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
also  in april  the company completed a public offering of million shares of common stock generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of the offering were used to finance the acquisition of the polyconfidence 
see capital resources 
financing applications of cash during included repayment of amounts outstanding under the company s short and long term credit arrangements and the payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
the notes  issued in february  have a stated and effective interest rate of percent and percent  respectively  and are due february  the notes are convertible  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share equivalent to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semi annually on each february and august the notes are redeemable  in whole or from time to time in part  at the option of the company  at any time on or after february  at specified redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal and premium  if any  and interest on all indebtedness of the company for borrowed money  other than the notes  with certain exceptions  and effectively subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all indebtedness of the company s subsidiaries 
the notes do not restrict the company s ability to incur other indebtedness or additional indebtedness of the company s subsidiaries 
in august  the company terminated its revolving credit facility which had provided a maximum credit commitment of million until december however  the company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately million in debt  equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement 
in addition  the company may issue  from time to time  up to eight million shares of common stock  which shares are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in july  in connection with one or more acquisitions by the company of securities or assets of other businesses 
the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures for major upgrades and continuing rig enhancements  and working capital requirements 
capital resources cash requirements for capital commitments result from rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and from the company s continuing rig enhancement program  including top drive drilling system installations and water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
it is management s opinion that operating cash flow resulting from current conditions of improved dayrates and high utilization  in conjunction with proceeds from the notes  will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses  or for general corporate purposes 
the company s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the company s results of operations  its current financial condition and other factors beyond its control 
during the year ended december   the company expended million  including capitalized interest expense  for significant rig upgrades in connection with contract requirements 
such upgrades included completion of modifications to the ocean star  the ocean clipper i  and the ocean victory 
in addition  a cantilever conversion project on the ocean warwick  a jack up drilling rig located in the gulf of mexico  began in early also  leg strengthening and other modifications began in late on the ocean tower  a jack up drilling rig operating in the gulf of mexico 
both upgrades are anticipated to be completed in the first half of the company has budgeted million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during included in this amount is approximately million for expenditures associated with the conversion of the polyconfidence soon to be renamed ocean confidence from an accommodation vessel to a semisubmersible drilling unit capable of operating in harsh environments and ultra deep waters 
the conversion includes enhancements which will provide capabilities greater than existing fourth generation equipment capability for operation in  foot water depths  approximately  tons variable deck load  a  psi blow out prevention system and four mud pumps to complement the existing class iii dynamic positioning system 
upon completion of the conversion  the rig will begin a five year drilling program in the gulf of mexico  which is anticipated to commence in late the company generally seeks to mitigate financial risk associated with its upgrade projects by deferring commencement of an upgrade until a term drilling contract is secured with major integrated or large independent oil companies with projected contract revenues substantially covering the upgrade costs 
the company expects to evaluate other projects as opportunities arise 
during the year ended december   the company expended million associated with its continuing rig enhancement program and other corporate requirements  including million to reactivate the ocean century to work in the gulf of mexico 
in addition to rig upgrade capital expenditures  the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures associated with its continuing rig enhancement program  spare equipment and other corporate requirements 
the increase in budgeted expenditures for is primarily attributable to anticipated purchases of anchor chain  drill pipe  riser  and other drilling equipment 
the company is continually considering potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of existing rigs  the purchase of existing rigs  construction of new rigs and the acquisition of other companies engaged in contract drilling 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business  although  in general  these opportunities have been related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
for example  the company has explored the possibility of acquiring certain floating production systems  crew accommodation units similar to the polyconfidence  oil service companies providing subsea products  technology and services  oil and gas exploration companies  and shipping assets such as oil tankers  through the acquisition of existing businesses or assets or new construction 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future and such acquisition could result in a material expansion of its existing operations or result in its entering a new line of business 
some of the potential acquisitions considered by the company could  if completed  result in the expenditure of a material amount of funds or the issuance of a material amount of debt or equity securities

other year issues 
the company has addressed the impact of the upcoming change in the century on the company s business  operations  and financial condition 
however  the impact is dependent upon many factors  including the company s software and hardware  as well as that of the company s suppliers  customers  creditors  and financial service organizations 
while the cost of addressing year issues is not anticipated to be material  the company is continuing to monitor  on an ongoing basis  the problems and uncertainties associated with these issues and their consequences 
currency risk 
certain of the company s subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency 
currency environments in which the company has material business operations include the uk  australia  brazil  indonesia and africa 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
because of this strategy  the company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
however  at present  contracts covering three of the company s four rigs operating in the uk sector of the north sea are payable in us dollars 
the company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and pounds sterling for operating costs payable in pounds sterling  although it may seek to do so in the future 
currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity 
when the company ceases its operations in a currency environment  the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations 
additionally  translation gains and losses for the company s operations in areas which have experienced cumulative inflation of approximately percent or more over a three year period are recognized currently 
the effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and is not expected to have a significant effect in the future

interest rate and equity price sensitivity the company s financial instruments that are potentially sensitive to changes in interest rates include the notes and investments through repurchase agreements 
in addition  the company s investment in equity securities is sensitive to equity price risk 
the notes  which are due february   have a stated interest rate of percent and an effective interest rate of percent 
at december   the fair value of the notes  based on quoted market prices  was approximately million  as compared to a carrying amount of million 
the company s investments through repurchase agreements bear interest at rates ranging from to percent 
however  these instruments are callable by the company at any time or have original maturities generally less than three months 
at december   the contracted amounts of such investments totaled million  which approximates fair value because of the nature and short maturity of these instruments 
at december   the fair value of the company s investment in equity securities was approximately million  which includes an unrealized holding loss of million 
based on consideration of past market movements and reasonably possible  near term market movements  the company does not believe that potential  near term losses in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows are likely to be material 
exchange rate sensitivity other than trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable  the company does not currently have financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates
