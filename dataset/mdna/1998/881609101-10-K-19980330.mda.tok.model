item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in the management s discussion and analysis that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page for discussion of the factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
general the company is focused on its long term strategy to maximize returns and develop full value of its assets through strategic expansions  acquisitions and diversifications in all of its operating segments 
in the refining and marketing segment  the company has been engaged in studies to improve profitability and continues to explore and evaluate opportunities for possible expansion through acquisitions  as well as joint ventures and strategic alliances 
operating strategies have been implemented to optimize the refinery product slate  improve efficiencies and reliability  and expand marketing to increase placement of products in alaska 
in  the company plans to further improve profitability in the refining and marketing segment by enhancing processing capabilities  strengthening marketing channels and improving supply and transportation functions 
in the exploration and production segment  the strategy includes evaluating ways in which the company can continue to diversify its oil and gas reserve base through both acquisitions and activities at the drill bit and enhance its technical capabilities 
the company has made significant progress in diversifying its us operations to areas other than the mature bob west field and has taken steps to begin serving emerging markets in south america 
in the marine services segment  improved profitability has positioned this segment to participate in the consolidation of the industry by pursuing opportunities for expansion  as well as optimizing existing operations 
in march  the company entered into an agreement to acquire the hawaiian refining and marketing assets of bhp petroleum americas refining inc bhp refining and bhp petroleum south pacific inc bhp south pacific 
the acquisition  if consummated  will nearly double tesoro s annual revenues and significantly increase the scope of tesoro s refining and marketing operations 
the company expects that the results of the acquisition will be accretive to earnings and cash flows  although it may be neutral in primarily due to a scheduled maintenance turnaround at the hawaii refinery to begin in june 
the company is currently in discussions with its investment bankers to arrange for financing of the acquisition and associated working capital and letter of credit requirements  and in connection with such discussions  the company has been advised that sufficient funds will be made available 
the company will continue to pursue other opportunities that are operationally and geographically complementary with its asset base 
for further information regarding the proposed acquisition  see capital resources and liquidity herein and note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item as part of the company s long term strategy  growth initiatives are planned in with a capital budget of million  excluding the acquisition discussed above 
the capital budget represents an increase of over capital expenditures 
approximately of the capital budget is directed toward increased drilling  both in bolivia and the us another is planned for downstream operations  primarily improvements in the alaska marketing operations 
external growth initiatives are primarily aimed at acquisitions which would add value from the combination with the company s existing assets  such as strengthening marketing opportunities  reducing logistic expenses or  in the downstream operations  offering increased processing opportunities 
initiatives to improve the profitability of each of the business segments  together with a debt to capitalization ratio of  have positioned the company to fund possible acquisitions and the capital budget with low cost capital 
the company operates in an environment where its results and cash flows are sensitive to volatile changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil used for refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products can result in a change in margin from the refining and marketing operations  as prices received for refined products may or may not keep pace with changes in crude oil costs 
these energy prices  together with volume levels  also determine the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventory 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories of crude oil and us wholesale refined products in its refining and marketing segment 
this method results in inventory carrying amounts that are less likely to represent current values and in costs of sales which more closely represent current costs 
likewise  changes in natural gas  condensate and oil prices impact revenues and the present value of estimated future net revenues and cash flows from the company s exploration and production operations 
the company may increase or decrease its natural gas production in response to market conditions 
the carrying value of oil and gas assets may be subject to noncash write downs based on changes in natural gas prices and other determining factors 
changes in natural gas prices also influence the level of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
the company s marine services operation  whose customers include offshore drilling contractors and related industries  could be impacted by significant fluctuations in natural gas prices 
the company s marine services segment uses the first in  first out fifo method of accounting for inventories of fuels 
changes in fuel prices can significantly impact inventory valuations and costs of sales in this segment 
results of operations summary tesoro s net earnings for were million per basic share  per diluted share compared to million per basic share  per diluted share in and million per basic share  per diluted share in in and  the company incurred noncash aftertax extraordinary losses of million and million  respectively  for early extinguishments of debt 
earnings before extraordinary losses amounted to million per basic share  per diluted share and million per basic share  per diluted share in and  respectively 
results for and included revenues from sales of natural gas at above market prices under a contract with tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee gas which was terminated effective october  results of operations in and future years no longer benefit from above market revenues under this contract 
significant items  including the impact of the tennessee gas contract  which affect the comparability between results for the years ended december   and are highlighted in the table below in millions except per share amounts net earnings as reported extraordinary loss on debt extinguishments  net of income tax benefit earnings before extraordinary item significant items affecting comparability  pretax income from retroactive severance tax refunds income from collection of bolivian receivable income from settlement of a natural gas contract operating profit from excess of contract prices over spot market prices interest and reimbursement of fees and costs from resolution of litigation gain loss on sale of assets costs to resolve shareholder consent solicitation employee termination costs and other total significant items  pretax income tax effect total significant items  aftertax net earnings loss excluding significant items and extraordinary item earnings per share basic as reported extraordinary loss impact of contract prices over spot market prices and settlement income effect of other significant items excluding significant items and extraordinary item earnings per share diluted as reported extraordinary loss impact of contract prices over spot market prices and settlement income effect of other significant items excluding significant items and extraordinary item as shown above  excluding the significant items  the company s net earnings would have been million per basic share  per diluted share in  as compared to net earnings of million per basic and diluted share in and a net loss of million per basic and diluted share in the resulting million increase in net earnings in was primarily attributable to better refined product margins  higher spot market natural gas prices and lower corporate interest expense 
when comparing to  after excluding significant items  the improvement in net earnings of approximately million was primarily attributable to improvements within the company s refining and marketing and marine services segments together with reduced general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the company s total effective tax rate in as earnings subject to us taxes exceeded available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to these results are presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  together with the following information  are intended to provide shareholders and other investors with a reasonable basis for assessing the company s operations  but should not serve as the sole criterion for predicting the future performance of the company

c amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current presentation 
d sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the kenai refinery  products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties 
the company s purchases of refined products for resale averaged approximately   and  barrels per day in  and  respectively 
e gross margins on total product sales include margins on sales of purchased products  together with the effect of changes in inventories 
compared to the refining and marketing segment s operating profit of million in increased million from operating profit of million in the improvement in results from refining and marketing has been due in part to the company s initiatives to enhance its product slate  improve efficiencies and sell a larger portion of the kenai refinery s production within the core alaska market 
in these regards  in early october  the company completed an expansion of the kenai refinery s hydrocracker unit  which increased the unit s capacity by approximately and enables the company to produce more jet fuel  a product in short supply in alaska 
the expansion  together with the addition of a new  high yield jet fuel hydrocracker catalyst  began to favorably impact this segment s results in the fourth quarter of the company estimates that its yield of middle distillates will average of total products manufactured at the kenai refinery during with respect to crude oil supply  during  the company negotiated contracts to purchase the remaining cook inlet crude oil production available for sale and  in october  began purchasing approximately  barrels per day of cook inlet crude oil in addition to the approximate  barrels per day under previously existing contracts 
substantially all of the contracts for purchases of cook inlet crude oil are for various periods extending through december as part of a three year  million retail marketing expansion program initiated in  the company built two new retail facilities  remodeled three stations  bought two stations and closed two uneconomic outlets 
at year end  the total number of retail stations selling the company s gasoline totaled as compared to in of these stations  are located in the pacific northwest  compared to at year end during  the company s production of refined products increased in total by due to higher throughput levels at the kenai refinery 
the operational changes  previously discussed  resulted in an increase in the production of middle distillates  primarily jet fuel  while gasoline production remained flat 
production of heavy oils and residual products increased by in the improved product slate  which better matches the company s product supply with demand in alaska  reflected the change of a hydrocracker catalyst in late and the hydrocracker expansion and catalyst change in late the company s sales of refined products within alaska increased by in contributing to higher product margins 
the improved product slate and marketing efforts  together with generally favorable industry conditions  resulted in an increase in the company s refinery spread to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in  reflecting a decrease in the company s per barrel feedstock cost with only a decline in per barrel yield value 
both years included scheduled day maintenance turnarounds 
revenues from sales of refined products in the company s refining and marketing segment increased during due primarily to a increase in sales volumes  partially offset by slightly lower average sales prices 
total refined product sales averaged  barrels per day in as compared to  barrels per day in other revenues  which included crude oil resales of million in and million in  declined due to lower sales volumes and prices 
the company had less crude oil available for resale in as throughput at the kenai refinery increased by  barrels per day  or  from and fewer spot purchases of crude oil were made 
export sales of refined products  including sales to the russian far east  amounted to million in compared to million in costs of sales decreased in due to lower spot purchases of crude oil and lower prices 
margins from non refinery activities increased to million in due primarily to higher retail sales and improved margins on products sold outside of alaska 
operating expenses increased in due primarily to higher employee costs  professional fees and marketing expenses 
the company s initiatives to enhance its product slate and sell more product within alaska  as discussed above  have improved the fundamental earnings potential of this segment 
certain of these initiatives  such as the hydrocracker expansion and additional crude oil supply contracts  were completed in the fourth quarter of future years will benefit from the impact of these initiatives for a full period 
future profitability of this segment  however  will continue to be influenced by market conditions  particularly as these conditions influence costs of crude oil relative to prices received for sales of refined products  and other additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
compared to results from the company s refining and marketing segment improved during with operating profit of million  compared to operating profit of million in this improvement was achieved during a year when the industry was facing rapidly rising prices in the crude oil market 
in addition  the company s production level at the kenai refinery was reduced in september for a scheduled day maintenance turnaround 
despite these factors  the company was able to achieve a refinery product spread of per barrel for  compared to per barrel in the company s results were helped by its initiatives to control costs  improve the kenai refinery s product slate and expand the marketing program for its refined products 
the company s average refined product yield value per barrel increased by in  while the company s feedstock costs per barrel increased by 
during  the company s production of refined products declined in total by  which included the impact of the scheduled maintenance period 
of this decline  gasoline production decreased by and middle distillates decreased by only 
these reductions reflected the change of a hydrocracker catalyst during the maintenance period  which allows for increased production of jet fuel and reduced production of gasoline beginning in the fourth quarter of  which better matches the company s product supply with demand in alaska 
during  the company s marketing efforts added locations in alaska and eight locations in the pacific northwest  bringing the total to branded  unbranded and company operated stations in alaska and branded stations in the pacific northwest at year end two uneconomic outlets in these areas were closed in in addition  the company began producing and marketing liquid asphalt  which is a seasonal product in alaska 
export sales of refined products  including sales to the russian far east  amounted to million in and million in revenues from sales of refined products in the company s refining and marketing segment decreased in due primarily to a decline in sales volumes  partially offset by a increase in average sales prices 
total refined product sales averaged  barrels per day in as compared to  barrels per day in this decline reflected the lower production volumes and the company s withdrawal from certain us west coast markets during  which also reduced the company s purchases from other refiners and suppliers to  barrels per day in as compared to  barrels per day in one of the us west coast facilities was sold in resulting in a loss of million 
sales of previously purchased crude oil increased to million in  compared to million in  due primarily to higher crude oil prices and in part due to sales of excess crude supply volumes during the maintenance period 
costs of sales decreased in due to lower volumes of refined products  partially offset by higher prices for crude oil and refined products 
operating expenses were higher in due primarily to higher environmental and employee costs partially offset by lower insurance costs

b results for and included revenues from above market pricing provisions of a contract with tennessee gas which was terminated effective october  operating profit for and included million and million  respectively  for the excess of these contract prices over spot market prices 
net natural gas production sold under the contract averaged approximately million cubic feet mmcf per day in and mmcf per day in upon termination of the contract  the company recorded other income and operating profit of million during the fourth quarter of see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item c includes effects of the company s natural gas commodity price agreements which amounted to losses of per thousand cubic feet mcf and per mcf in and  respectively  and a gain of per mcf in exploration and production us compared to operating profit from the company s us operations was million in  compared with million in comparability between these years was impacted by several major transactions in  including the favorable resolution in august of litigation regarding the tennessee gas contract and the termination of the remainder of the contract effective october  as provided for in the tennessee gas contract  which was to expire in january  the company was selling a portion of the gas produced in the bob west field pursuant to a contract price  which was above the average spot market price 
in total  during the company received approximately million in cash for the resolution of litigation and termination of the tennessee gas contract  with the company s exploration and production segment recording operating profit of million upon termination of the contract 
in and  the exploration and production segment s operating profit also included million and million  respectively  from the excess of tennessee gas contract prices over spot market prices 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item additionally  during  substantially all of the company s proved producing reserves in the bob west field were certified by the texas railroad commission as high cost gas from a designated tight formation  eligible for state severance tax exemptions from the date of first production through august accordingly  no severance tax is recorded on current production from the exempt wells in the bob west field beginning in in and  the company recognized income of million and million  respectively  for retroactive severance tax refunds for production in prior years 
excluding the impact of the incremental contract value and income from the severance tax refunds  operating profit from the company s us operations would have been million in compared to million in the resulting increase of million was primarily attributable to higher spot market prices for sales of natural gas  partially offset by higher depletion and operating expenses 
prices realized by the company on its natural gas production sold in the spot market increased to per mcf in from per mcf in the company s weighted average sales price  which included the above market pricing of the tennessee gas contract in  decreased in due to the termination of the contract 
the company s net production averaged mmcfe per day in  a decrease of mmcfe per day from this decrease consisted of a mmcf per day decline from the bob west field  partially offset by a mmcfe per day increase from other us fields 
the company s us production outside of the bob west field rose to of its total us production by january  as compared to at year end 
gross operating revenues from the company s us operations  after excluding amounts related to tennessee gas  increased due to the higher spot market prices 
production costs were higher by million per mcfe due mainly to costs at the bob west field  including increased compression costs and a charge for ad valorem taxes in as well as the impact of lower processing fees in administrative support and other operating expenses decreased by million 
depreciation and depletion increased by million  or  due to a higher depletion rate 
from time to time  the company enters into commodity price agreements to reduce the risk caused by fluctuations in the prices of natural gas in the spot market 
during  and  the company used such agreements to set the price of  and  respectively  of the natural gas production that it sold in the spot market 
during and  the company realized losses of million per mcf and million per mcf  respectively  from these price agreements 
in  the effects of natural gas price agreements resulted in a gain of million per mcf 
the company had no remaining price agreements outstanding at december  compared to operating profit of million from the company s us operations in increased million from operating profit of million in comparability between these years was impacted by several major transactions 
as discussed above  the results included the impact of the incremental value of the tennessee gas contract 
operating profit for included a gain of million from the sale of certain interests in the bob west field see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
excluding the impact of the incremental contract value from both years and the gain on sale of assets from  operating profit from the company s us operations for would have been million compared to million for the resulting increase was primarily due to higher spot market prices for sales of natural gas  as industry demand increased due to unusually cold weather combined with below normal storage levels 
prices realized by the company on its natural gas production sold in the spot market increased to per mcf in from per mcf in excluding  mcf per day related to the sold interests from  the company s spot production increased by  mcf per day during the company s exploration and acquisition programs outside of the bob west field contributed  mcf per day of the increase in spot production with the remaining increase attributable to sales to tennessee gas at spot prices effective october  the company s weighted average sales price increased to per mcf in as compared to per mcf in for the bob west field  production declined by  mcf per day after excluding amounts related to sold interests in gross operating revenues from the company s us operations  after excluding million related to the sold interests from  decreased by million due primarily to the decline in volumes sold under the tennessee gas contract  and losses under commodity price agreements discussed above  partially offset by increases in spot market sales prices and production 
the decline in production costs of million  or per mcfe  was mainly attributable to the severance tax exemptions in the bob west field 
total depreciation  depletion and amortization was lower in due to lower production volumes  partially offset by a higher depletion rate 
exploration and production bolivia the company s bolivian natural gas production is sold to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos ypfb  a bolivian governmental agency  which in turn sells the natural gas to yacimientos petroliferos fiscales  sa ypf  a publicly held company based in argentina 
currently  the company s sales of natural gas production are based on the volume and pricing terms in a contract between ypfb and ypf  which was extended in april for an additional two years to march   with an option to extend the contract a maximum of one additional year if a pipeline being constructed from bolivia to brazil is not complete 
in the contract extension  ypf negotiated an reduction in the minimum contract volume that it is required to import from bolivia  which in turn resulted in a corresponding reduction of the company s minimum contract volume to mmcf per day gross net 
the contract gas prices fluctuate since they are linked to a monthly average fuel oil price posted in the new york spot market 
a lack of market access has constrained natural gas production in bolivia 
the company believes that the completion of a  mile pipeline from bolivia to brazil will provide access to larger gas consuming markets 
upon completion of this pipeline  the company will face intense competition from major and independent natural gas companies operating in bolivia for a share of the contractual volumes to be exported to brazil 
it is anticipated that each producer s share of the contractual volumes will be allocated by ypfb according to a number of factors  including each producer s reserve volumes and production capacity 
although the company expects gas deliveries on the pipeline to begin in early  there can be no assurance that the pipeline will be operational by such date 
with the exception of the volumes currently under contract with the bolivian government  the company cannot be assured of the amount of additional volumes that will be exported to brazil upon completion of the pipeline 
compared to operating profit from the company s bolivian operations decreased to million in  from million operating profit in results for benefited from income of million related to the collection of a receivable for prior years production 
without this income  operating profit would have decreased by million in due to declines in natural gas and condensate production and prices 
with the company s purchase of interests held by its former joint venture participant in july  the company s share of production from bolivia increased by approximately beginning in the third quarter see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
however  earlier in the year  the company s bolivian natural gas production was lower due to a reduction in minimum takes under the new contract between ypfb and ypf and also due to constraints arising from repairs to a non company owned pipeline that transports gas from bolivia to argentina 
in addition  during  production was higher due to requests from ypfb for additional production from the company to meet export specifications 
natural gas prices fell to per mcf in  compared to per mcf in condensate prices fell to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in compared to operating profit from the company s bolivian operations increased to million in  from the million operating profit in this improvement was primarily due to a increase in production of natural gas  primarily due to increased demand from ypfb during the second and third quarters of  together with higher prices received for both natural gas and condensate 
operating expenses declined by on a per unit basis reflecting a decrease in costs combined with the increase in volumes 
partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization of million 
marine services dollars in millions gross operating revenues fuels lubricants and other services gross operating revenues costs of sales gross profit operating expenses and other depreciation and amortization operating profit loss sales volumes millions of gallons fuels  primarily diesel lubricants capital expenditures compared to gross operating revenues increased by million  which included a million increase in fuels and lubricant revenues and a million increase in service revenues 
the increase in fuels and lubricant revenues was primarily due to a increase in sales volumes  partially offset by lower prices 
the service revenue increase of was due in part to increased rig activity in the gulf of mexico and the company s focus to serve these customers 
additional terminal locations stemming from an acquisition consummated in february together with internal growth initiatives have enabled the company to increase its sales activity 
costs of sales increased in due to the higher volumes 
the improvement of million in gross profit was offset by higher operating and other expenses associated with the increased activity together with upgrades to facilities and services 
the marine service s segment business is largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the gulf of mexico 
compared to in february  the company acquired coastwide energy services  inc coastwide and combined these operations with the company s marine petroleum products distribution business  forming a marine services segment 
operating results from coastwide have been included in the company s marine services segment since the date of acquisition 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the marine services segment consisted of terminals at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
the increase of million in fuels and lubricants revenues was primarily due to the added locations and associated volumes combined with higher fuel prices 
in addition  revenues from services grew by million 
these increases in revenues together with improved margins during were partially offset by higher operating and other expenses associated with the increased activity 
depreciation and amortization increased during due to capital additions during the year 
in total  operating profit of million in reflected a turnaround from the losses incurred in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to higher employee costs partially offset by lower professional fees and insurance costs 
when comparing to  the decrease was primarily due to lower employee and labor costs resulting from cost reduction measures implemented by the company in late interest expense and interest income interest expense totaled million in  compared with million in and million in the company s redemption of public debt of million in november and million in december contributed to these interest savings 
interest income was million in  compared with million in and million in the fluctuation in included interest of approximately million received from tennessee gas in conjunction with the collection of a receivable which resulted from underpayment for natural gas sold in prior periods see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
other expense  net other expense was million in  compared with million in and million in in  the company incurred costs of million to resolve a shareholder consent solicitation  together with a write off of deferred financing costs and increased expenses related to the company s former operations 
there were no material comparable costs recorded in when comparing to  the increase in other expense was due to the costs recorded in  partially offset by lower employee termination and restructuring costs 
income tax provision the income tax provision was million in  compared with million in and million in effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
the decrease in the income tax provision in was primarily attributable to lower earnings  partially offset by a higher effective rate due to bolivian taxes 
when comparing to  the income tax provision increased due to earnings subject to us taxes exceeding available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
capital resources and liquidity overview the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  internal cash generation and external financing 
during  the company made capital expenditures of million  which were funded through a combination of cash flows from operations of million  external financing and available cash balances 
at december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was which enhances the company s ability to access capital markets 
additional financing will be required for the proposed acquisition of bhp refining and bhp south pacific and associated working capital and letters of credit requirements 
the company is currently in discussions with its investment bankers to arrange for such financing  and in connection with such discussions  the company has been advised that sufficient funds will be made available 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the company operates in an environment where its liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  market uncertainty and a variety of additional risks that are beyond the control of the company 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  the proximity of the company s natural gas reserves to pipelines  the capacities of such pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall market and economic conditions

credit arrangements the company s amended and restated corporate revolving credit agreement credit facility  which expires in april  provides total commitments of million from a consortium of nine banks 
the company  at its option  has currently activated million of these commitments 
the credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit  and for cash borrowings up to million  with the aggregate subject to a borrowing base which amount exceeded total commitments at december  
outstanding obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by first liens on substantially all of the company s trade receivables  product inventories and south texas natural gas reserves and by a third lien on the kenai refinery 
at december   the company had outstanding cash borrowings of million under the credit facility 
cash borrowings under the credit facility are generally used on a short term basis to finance working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
under the credit facility  at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of million  primarily for royalty crude oil purchases from the state of alaska 
unused availability  including unactivated commitments  under the credit facility at december  for additional borrowings and letters of credit totaled million 
the company is also permitted to utilize unsecured letters of credit outside of the credit facility up to million none outstanding at december  
the credit facility  which has been amended from time to time  requires the company to maintain specified levels of consolidated working capital  tangible net worth  cash flow and interest coverage and contains other covenants customary in credit arrangements of this kind 
among other matters  the terms of the credit facility allow for general open market stock repurchases and the payment of cash dividends subject to a cumulative amount available for restricted payments defined as the difference of i the sum since december   of a million and b of consolidated net earnings of the company in any calendar year and ii any restricted payments made since june 
at december   the cumulative amount available for restricted payments was approximately million 
in addition to the cumulative restriction  the credit facility further limits these general open market stock repurchases and cash dividends to a maximum of million annually 
the credit facility also permits the company to repurchase a limited amount of common stock  up to million annually  specifically for oddlot buyback programs and employee benefit or compensation plans 
the board of directors has no present plans to pay dividends 
however  from time to time  the board of directors reevaluates the feasibility of declaring future dividends 
for further information on the company s credit arrangements  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements in item debt and other obligations under an agreement reached in  which settled a contractual dispute with the state of alaska state  the company is obligated to make variable monthly payments to the state through december based on a per barrel charge on the volume of feedstock processed through the kenai refinery s crude unit 
in and  based on a per barrel throughput charge of cents  the company s variable payments to the state totaled million and million  respectively 
in  based on a per barrel throughput charge of cents  the company s variable payments to the state totaled million 
the per barrel charge increases to cents in with one cent annual incremental increases thereafter through in january  the company is obligated to pay the state million  provided  however  that such payment may be deferred indefinitely  at the company s option  by continuing the variable monthly payments to the state beginning at cents per barrel for and increasing one cent per barrel annually thereafter 
variable monthly payments made after january will not reduce the million obligation to the state 
the million obligation is evidenced by a security bond  and the bond and the throughput barrel obligations are collateralized by a fourth lien on the kenai refinery 
the company s obligations under the agreement with the state and the mortgage are subordinated to current and future senior debt of up to million plus any indebtedness incurred subsequent to the date of the agreement to improve the kenai refinery 
loans obtained to finance the expansion of the hydrocracker unit and install the vacuum unit  discussed in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  qualify as indebtedness incurred subsequent to this agreement to improve the kenai refinery 
stock repurchase program on may   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares approximately of outstanding shares of tesoro common stock in a buyback program that will extend through the end of under the program  subject to certain conditions  the company may repurchase from time to time tesoro common stock in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
purchases will depend on price  market conditions and other factors and will be made primarily from cash flows
