impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed as assessment to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
currently  the entire property management system is year compliant and has been thoroughly tested 
since the company s accounting software is maintained and supported by a third party  the total year project cost is estimated to be minimal 
the project is estimated to be completed not later than september   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
additionally  the company has received assurances from its contractors that all of the company s building management and mechanical systems are currently year compliant or will be made compliant prior to any impact on those systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and costs of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
see selected financial data 
in march  nareit issued a white paper analysis to address certain interpretive issues under its definition of ffo 
the white paper provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income to arrive ad ffo 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
the following table presents the company s ffo calculation in thousands pro forma year year june  year ended ended to ended december december december december income before limited partners interest in operating partnership and extraordinary items     less extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in operating partnership of  and  respectively    limited partners minority interest in operating partnership     net income     adjustment for funds from operations add limited partners minority interest in operating partnership     depreciation and amortization     minority interests in consolidated partnership extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in operating partnership of  and  respectively    less gain on sale of property amount distributed to minority partners in consolidated partnership    funds from operations ffo     weighted average shares units outstanding     pro forma amounts have been prepared as if the ipo and the formation transactions occurred on january  assumes conversion of limited partnership units of the operating partnership
