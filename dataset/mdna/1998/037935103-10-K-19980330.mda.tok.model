item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview from its inception in until  the company has focused on designing  manufacturing and marketing tools used in the debugging of embedded software 
the company s product line initially consisted primarily of chassis style in circuit emulators  highly technical tools utilized at that time by hardware engineers 
in the late s  customer demand focused increasingly on tools with greater speed  software sophistication  ease of use and price performance value 
by  the company s sales and profitability began to decline due to various factors  including a poorly targeted product development strategy  slowness in responding to changing customer requirements and increasing competition 
beginning in mid  the company assembled a new management team that devised and began implementing a new business strategy 
as a part of this new strategy  management effected a restructuring of the company  which included significant headcount reductions and a refocusing of its product line by concentrating marketing and engineering activity on new hardware enhanced software tools for use with a broad range of intel and motorola and bit embedded microprocessors  employing advanced hardware designs to reduce size and cost  and emphasizing ease of use by software engineers 
following this restructuring  the company reengineered its pocket sized codetap emulator in late  introduced its compact and more affordable codeice emulator in  and began shipping codetest software testing tools focused on embedded test in late in  the company released supertap  which brings full featured emulation into a codetap form factor  and introduced its hardware software co verification tool  vsp tap  to enhance its distribution agreement with eagle design automation 
in  the company released codetest registered trademark act  an enhanced suite of mcdc software test and analysis tools for c language applications  and codetrace tm  a source level trace analysis tool 
the company s strategy has resulted in lower average selling prices and increased unit volumes 
the company s sales through its foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the company s reported net sales 
the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the company s net sales is dependent in part upon the company s pricing policies 
the company is  however  unable to predict currency exchange rate fluctuations and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue to affect its net sales to varying degrees in the future 
the company expects international sales  especially in japan  to continue to account for a significant percentage of its net sales 
to enhance its competitive position  it will be necessary for the company to continue developing its technology base and broadening its product offerings to address additional needs within the embedded software development process 
these objectives may require expansion of the company s internal product development efforts or acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products or technologies in related market segments 
the company believes that the growth rates reflected in results of operations for prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of growth rates for future periods 
the company also believes that competition is likely to increase  which could result in loss of market share  price reductions or reduced margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income  expressed as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income interest expense and other income income before income taxes income taxes net income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the unit growth and average selling price in sales of low cost debug and codetest tm tools and an increase in support contract revenues 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in unit sales of higher priced debug tools and to a lesser extent currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of international sales 
the company s net sales are presently derived predominantly from sales of software design  debugging and testing tools 
the company s net sales also include product support revenues  which represented and of net sales in and  respectively  as well as patent license royalties 
the company generally recognizes revenues from product sales upon shipment  and recognizes product support revenues ratably over the life of each maintenance contract  typically months 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
international sales outside of north america in us dollars increased by in over the comparable period of  to of net sales as compared to of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in international sales is attributable to increased unit sales  which is due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts 
the company estimates that unfavorable currency rate fluctuations affecting the dollar value of sales by the company s foreign subsidiaries  especially in japan  resulted in a reduction in the company s net sales in based upon the change from the average rate 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the increases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in higher margin support contract revenue  an increase in the percentage of net sales attributable to newer low cost debug and codetest products that have lower material costs as a percentage of sales price  and favorable cost reductions on certain hardware components 
these savings were partially offset by declines in sales revenue due to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increase in factory overhead 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the dollar amount increase between comparable periods was primarily attributable to increased compensation related expenses resulting principally from increased headcount and salaries  and to a lesser extent  increases in travel and entertainment  recruiting  and promotional costs and foreign exchange losses 
the percentage increase between comparable periods was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated revenues for the year as compared to the increase in budgeted costs 
the company expects its sales and marketing expenditures to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as it introduces and markets new products  and continues to expand its sales  general and administrative organization 
foreign exchange gains and losses are included in sales  general and administrative expenses 
in order to mitigate certain intercompany risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  the company  does from time to time  hedge a portion of its foreign exchange risk in japan as it relates to the trade debt the company s japanese subsidiary owes to the company 
although the company generally plans to continue to engage in exchange rate hedging activities with respect to certain exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that it will do so or that any such activities will successfully protect the company against such risks 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expenses between comparable periods was primarily attributable to a decrease in external development funding received from third parties that offsets expenses and to an increase hardware prototype related costs 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in product development  including development of software design  debugging and test tools for additional embedded microprocessors as well as continued advanced development in future directions 
as a result  the company anticipates that net research and development expenses are likely to increase for the foreseeable future 
income taxes 
the company s income tax provision for  and reflects utilization of net operating loss nol and general business credit carryforwards 
as of december  the company had remaining nol carryforwards of million and research and development credit carryforwards of million  both of which will expire in various amounts through the utilization of these amounts in the future is subject to an annual limit of approximately  under the internal revenue code 
as a result of these limitations  the company anticipates that in the future its effective tax rate will approach the statutory rate in future years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of debug products and to sales of codetest which began shipping in november  which were partially offset by a decline in average selling prices due to an increased proportion of sales represented by lower priced codetap and netrom tools and to negative currency exchange rate fluctuation 
the company s net sales also include product support revenues  which represented and of net sales in and  respectively  as well as patent license royalties commencing in the second quarter of international sales outside of north america in us dollars increased by in over the comparable period of  to of net sales as compared to of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in international sales is attributable to increased unit sales  which is due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts 
the company estimates that unfavorable currency rate fluctuations affecting sales by the company s foreign subsidiaries  especially in japan  resulted in a reduction in the company s net sales in based upon the change from the rate 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the increases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the percentage of net sales attributable to newer debug and recently introduced codetest products that have lower material and labor costs  and to a lesser extent  increased leverage of fixed and semi variable manufacturing costs  and favorable cost reductions on certain hardware components 
these savings were partially offset by declines in sales revenue due to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the dollar amount increase between comparable periods was primarily attributable to increased compensation related expenses resulting principally from increased sales force headcount 
sales  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of net sales due to the company s ability to leverage certain fixed selling  general and administrative expenses over an increased sales base 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expenses between comparable periods was primarily attributable to increased compensation related expenses resulting principally from increased engineering headcount relating to new product development 
aggregate amounts devoted to product development  prior to offsetting such amounts with external development funding from semiconductor manufacturers  increased to million in from million in quarterly results of operations the company s results of operations have in the past fluctuated substantially from quarter to quarter  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue as a result of a variety of factors 
product and price competition  research and development requirements  the volume and timing of customer development projects and orders  introductions of new embedded microprocessors  announcements or introductions of new products or technologies by the company or its competitors  foreign currency exchange rates  variations in external product development funding  investments in marketing and distribution  price increases by suppliers  parts shortages  conditions in the embedded systems market and the electronics industry in general  and national and global economic conditions may be expected to cause significant variations in the company s quarterly operating results 
as a result  the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the company s net sales have historically reflected some seasonality in that sales growth typically tends to flatten between the second and third quarters of the year  coincident with the slowing of business activity during the summer months in many industrialized nations 
moreover  a significant portion of the company s net sales in each quarter generally results from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital principally for the financing of inventory  capital equipment and accounts receivable  and for investment in product development activities and new technologies 
to date  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of equity securities 
in november  the company completed its initial public offering pursuant to which it sold  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
during  the company generated million of cash from operations  utilized million of cash for equipment purchases  and utilized  of cash for net debt reduction 
as of december   the company had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company has revolving credit facilities aggregating million from a commercial bank 
there were no outstanding balances under these facilities as of december  the credit facilities bear interest at the bank s floating prime rate and are unsecured 
the loan documents also contain customary negative covenants 
the credit facilities expire in may and the company anticipates renegotiating a new line at comparable terms 
the company currently has no specific commitments with regard to capital expenditures  but expects to spend an aggregate of approximately million in for new capital equipment 
the company anticipates that its annual capital expenditures will increase gradually in the future as a function of replacement cycles and anticipated growth of the company s business 
the company s capital needs may be further affected by its plans to broaden product offerings through a combination of internal development  third party relationships and acquisitions of other business products or technologies 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances at year end together with funds from operations and borrowings  will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
the company s future capital requirements will  however  depend on a number of factors  including costs associated with product development efforts  the success of the commercial introduction of the company s products and the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent additional capital is required  the company may sell additional equity  debt or convertible securities  or obtain additional credit facilities 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment with its software vendors and will have to upgrade portions of its software so that its computer systems will functions properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company systematically upgrades its software to take advantage of bug fixes  feature enhancement and performance improvements as a standard course of business 
the upgrades scheduled for will address all identified year issues and will not involve any extra costs that would not normally occur in the standard course of business 
the company believes that with the upgrades to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such upgrades are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company is also planning to inquire with key suppliers and financial institutions  to verify that they will not be at risk from this problem 
the company believes its products are not subject to this problem and plans to test its products before the year outlook issues and uncertainties the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance or sales volumes  although this annual report contains certain other forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company may  in discussions of its future plans  objectives and expected performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission or documents incorporated by reference therein and in written and oral presentations made by the company  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of or section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions which the company believes are reasonable  but are by their nature inherently uncertain 
in all cases  there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove correct or that projected events will occur 
actual results could differ materially from those projected depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the issues discussed below 
while company management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook and for forward looking statements 
rapidly changing technology and product development uncertainties 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend upon its ability to anticipate market demand for specific embedded microprocessors  develop new products and features that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices 
manufacturing uncertainties 
a number of the company s components are manufactured by a single source or distributed through a limited number of outlets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able in the future to obtain key components in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  or on favorable price terms 
product ship schedules 
delays in new product releases could impact revenue growth rates and cause customer base to become dissatisfied and erode 
prices 
prices the company can obtain for its products may decrease from historical levels  depending on competitive market or cost factors which could have an adverse effect on revenues and gross margin 
cost of sales 
although cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased in and  it varies with channel mix and product mix within channels 
such mix factors may increase cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
semiconductor manufacturers 
a substantial decline in the number of design starts for bit or bit embedded microprocessors produced by intel  amd or motorola or delays by such manufacturers in the release of embedded microprocessors for which the company has developed tools could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues 
industry focus 
the company s sales are concentrated primarily in the internetworking  telecommunications and computer peripherals markets and any negative events affecting the electronics industry or these markets in particular could have an adverse effect on revenues 
competition 
the company expects competition to increase from established and emerging companies 
sales and marketing and research and development costs may increase in dollar amounts and as a percentage of sales in order for the company to successfully compete 
key personnel 
the company believes that its future success will depend largely upon its ability to retain and attract key personnel and skilled employees 
management of growth 
the company has grown rapidly since and plans to continue to invest in product lines and sales and marketing 
the company s growth plans will present management  competitive and other challenges to the company s managers and employees 
intellectual property 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to protect its technology and preserve its trade secrets 
product liability 
the use of the company s tools in the development of embedded systems that are incorporated in products used by or affecting the general public  or that otherwise pose a risk of serious consequences if they do not perform flawlessly under critical conditions  could expose the company to significant product liability claims 
global economic conditions 
almost half of the company s business occurs outside of north america 
economic crisis in any of these regions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
foreign exchange 
a large percentage of the company s sales  costs of sales and marketing is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
litigation 
the company may become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights  patents  and copyrights 
if an adverse judgment were entered against the company  such a proceeding could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operation
