item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing and marketing the company s subsidiary  sddt  has installed plant and machinery for the manufacture and assembly of the components for reliaject tm on a limited production basis and has now either purchased or entered into the necessary capital commitments to provide high volume manufacturing at the new facility at napa  california which is planned to begin during the second half of sddt has responsibility for the supply chain activities of providing reliaject tm components to specialized contract manufacturers who will perform the assembly of reliaject tm and fill the syringe with compounds such as the invicorp tm and epinephrine formulations  perform final assembly and complete pack preparation prior to distribution 
the active materials  vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine mesylate which are formulated in the invicorp tm preparation are currently available in commercial quantities from two suppliers 
these suppliers have developed synthetic methods which are included in the product licensing applications 
there is therefore a degree of reliance on these specialized suppliers for continued supply of materials 
in the case of ccsi  manufacture  filling and labelling of its products are now outsourced 
in south africa and the united kingdom licenses to manufacture have been granted for the mill creek line of products 
ccsi s products are distributed internationally  with the majority of the products being sold within the north american free trade area nafta through its marketing organization covering two main sectors  natural products  and speciality mass markets 
distribution agreements have been signed with in the us and abroad 
there is no significant reliance on main or specialised suppliers  and it is not anticipated that problems will arise over the question of access to raw materials that are generally available and that will be required for ccsi s contract manufacturing processes 
in accordance with an agreement entered into with the research foundation for mental hygiene inc the foundation  the company  which has been granted the exclusive right to certain of the foundation s cell lines capable of producing certain monoclonal antibodies  including those applicable to alzheimer s disease  and continues to effect sales of such antibodies  which are sourced from outside suppliers to the scientific community for research purposes in consideration for a royalty entitlement in favor of the foundation 
the company is reliant on the sourcing of the monoclonal antibodies from a specific biotech organization at the present time 
in the case of any emerging products  the company anticipates that any manufacturing and marketing activities may be arranged through co development and marketing agreements with companies which have already established a majority presence in specialised fields 
in this event  any revenues to be generated will arise primarily through third party distribution or licensing arrangements or co ventures whereby the company will seek to receive a percentage of sales  licence fees and or milestone payments in consideration for its grant of specified marketing rights to its products  or by profit participation through a third party equity investment or joint venture 
competition the biomedical industry is highly competitive and the company s business and research efforts compete with drug discovery programs at biotechnology companies as well as with internal drug discovery efforts of pharmaceutical companies  acting independently or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies  and their public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection  discover competing products  or establish collaborative arrangements in the company s area of research 
the vast majority of the company s existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources and name recognition than the company and are better equipped to develop  manufacture  and market products 
in addition  many of these companies have extensive experience in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials 
these companies may develop and introduce products competitive with or superior to those of the company 
the timing of the market introduction of competitors products will be important competitive factors 
accordingly  the relative speed with which the company can develop products  complete pre clinical testing  clinical trials and the necessary regulatory approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be critical to the company s success 
once products have been approved for sale  the company believes that competition will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  price and patent position 
the company s competitive position also depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to develop proprietary products or processes and the degree of patent protection obtainable 
the company expects competition to intensify in all fields in which it is involved as new products in these areas are developed and become more widely known 
moreover  the patent situation in this field is complex  and the protection afforded by patents in any particular jurisdiction can be limited 
the company cannot predict the extent to which any of the products in the course of development may become commercially viable 
assuming that product license approval is granted for the invicorp tm product within a reasonable time  it is hoped that subsequently this product may be available for marketing in the uk in the third quarter of in the case of msd  certain competing products have been or are being developed for the particular application being undertaken by the company  and in particular  three other us companies pharmacia upjohn  pfizer and vivus inc have developed  and are marketing internationally  products that compete directly with invicorp tm 
there are indications that there should be a substantial potential demand for a product in this field but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in penetrating this potential market 
with regard to reliaject tm  there are already a number of syringes on the market and there are two direct competitors whose products are being used extensively  mainly in the us  but also in other areas 
for regulatory approval purposes  syringes have to be identified with the medical compound which they are designed to deliver 
in the opinion of the company  based upon extensive uk clinical trials for invicorp tm  reliaject tm which utilizes a dental cartridge and a gauge needle is of an extremely high standard and capable of competing successfully with products currently on the market and is one which can  after instruction  be utilized by the patient without medical supervision and is moreover relatively painless 
in the case of ccsi  bearing in mind the vast health and beauty care market is dominated by large multi national organizations  who have far greater resources and market exposure than the company and ccsi  ccsi s products are designed to meet specific niche segments of the market 
ccsi s products include the mill creek line  which features the kinetin compound  sleepy hollow botanticals and biotene h the speciality mass market lines are silver fox a product for gray hair  and the allercreme  hypoallergenic range for sensitive skins  that was developed in conjunction with dermatologists 
the dubarry range  a long established cosmetic line was sold during the mill creek range  including kinetin  has been launched as a next generation of skin care products  and is designed to replace alpha hydroxy acid lines  marketed by other organizations  as a product of choice 
however  major companies may introduce competitive lines of similar or superior quality and may be able to effect a greater marketing impact than the company can achieve 
government regulation the company s research and development activities and future product manufacturing and marketing activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and europe 
in the us  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act governs the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labelling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising  and promotion of the company s products in the us 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
many products ultimately do not reach the market because of toxicity or lack of effectiveness as demonstrated by required testing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that this regulatory framework will not change or that additional regulations will not arise at any stage of the company s product development that may affect approval  delay an application  or require additional expenditures by the company 
after approval is obtained  failure to comply with present or future regulatory requirements  or new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of an approved drug  can lead to fda withdrawal of approval to market the product 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include i preclinical laboratory testing  ii submission to the fda of an ind application which must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced  iii adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  iv submission of an nda to the fda and v fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
to date  the company has submitted and received ind status for its invicorp tm product 
clinical testing of new compounds in humans is designed to establish both safety and efficacy in treating a particular disease or condition 
these studies are usually conducted in three phases of testing 
in phase i  a small number of volunteers are given the new compound in order to identify toxicities and characterize the compound s behaviour in humans 
in phase ii  small numbers of patients with the targeted disease are given the compound to test its efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to establish effective dose levels 
phase iii studies  which have been concluded by the company for invicorp tm  are large scale studies designed to confirm a compound s efficacy for the targeted disease and identify toxicities that might not have been seen in smaller studies 
once adequate data has been obtained in clinical testing to demonstrate that the compound is both safe and effective for the intended use  all available data will need to be submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
review of this application by the fda can cover an extended period 
marketing of products requires regulatory approval from the relevant medicines evaluation agency in a particular country 
no action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country 
the current approval process varies from country to country  and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for fda approval 
the review of clinical studies by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions follows a similar a process to that in the us and the company anticipates a number of approvals in europe during following on from these approvals will be the choice of a rapporteur country for pan european licensing approval 
in certain european countries  the sales price of a product must also be approved 
the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted 
no assurance can be given that  even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority  satisfactory prices will be a approved for such product 
under current regulations  the market introduction of the majority of non medicated cosmetics and skin care products do not require prior formal registration or approval by the fda  although this could change in the future 
the cosmetics division of the fda monitors matters of safety and adulteration 
the situation for non medicated cosmetic and skin care products is the same for europe 
import restrictions and duties because the company may be importing certain of its products or product ingredients into the united states  the company could be subject to quantity limitations  duties and tariffs imposed by a country within which the products are to be sold 
the united states does not have quantity restrictions for goods such as the company s proposed products but does impose tariffs based on the value of the products imported 
other countries may have different restrictions and duties 
patents the company believes that patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of its business and as part of its grant agreements with various researchers  has received exclusive license rights to any commercially valuable products developed by the contracted researchers within the scope of the respective agreements in exchange for royalty entitlements 
the company s policy is to file patent applications to protect inventions and improvements that are considered important to the development of its business 
typically  patents expire years after the grant date 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position 
the company has filed patent applications for its products in most major countries including those that are signatories to the patent conference treaty pct 
thus far  reliaject tm is patented in most pct countries and in major areas in asia and south america  and additionally the company has received patent approvals covering its technology for the treatment of the effects of aging on skin in the us  and for the treatment of psoriasis and other hyper proliferative skin diseases in the us  canada and australia and male sexual dysfunction in the us  australia  czech republic  hungary  israel  latvia  lithuania  mexico and taiwan 
patent positions generally  including those for pharmaceutical and health service organizations such as the company  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are largely unresolved 
in addition  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued 
consequently  the company cannot be sure that any patents that are or may be issued to it will provide significant proprietary protection or will not be circumvented or invalidated 
because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issued  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  the company cannot be certain that it or any licensor was the first creator or that it or such licensor was the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
moreover  the company might have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of inventions  which could result in substantial cost to the company  whether or not the eventual outcome were favorable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s patents  if issued  would be held valid by a court or that a competitor s technology or product would be found to infringe such patents 
a number of pharmaceutical and health services companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications  or received patents in areas that may be related to the company s business 
some of these technologies applications  or patents may conflict with the company s development efforts or patent applications 
ccsi has acquired the numerous trademarks formerly owned by carme inc to the best of ccsi s knowledge  there has been no indication to date that such trademarks are invalid or are subject to challenge 
typically  the company requires its employees  consultants and sponsored researchers to execute confidentiality agreements as part of their employment  consulting or research arrangements with the company 
there can be no assurances however  that these agreements will produce meaningful or adequate protection for the company s trade secrets 
employees as of december  senetek  together with its two subsidiaries sddt and ccsi  employed full time employees 
corporate employees comprise persons in the united kingdom of whom are employed at the company s drug development center at kettering  and in the us  of whom are employed in the research center in st louis and in the executive offices in napa 
sddt corporation employed persons in the us  who concentrate on the scientific  engineering and production aspects of reliaject tm 
ccsi has employees covering the production  marketing  advertising and distribution of ccsi s products  including a team covering the management and financial aspects of ccsi s business

these premises are held under a year lease terminating in march  in april the company surrendered its lease for the ground floor of unit montague court  kettering  uk and entered into a new agreement for the complete unit the term of the lease is years with a break option after years 
at the present time part of the first floor is sub let to a company which is not affiliated with senetek  for a term of years 
the kettering office accommodates invicorp tm development  clinical monitoring and regulatory staff and maintains inventories of invicorp tm prior to delivery to clinical trials or named patient sales

these business entities have been combined into a new  square foot facility in napa  california with effect from the beginning of the napa lease is for a year term  expiring on december  the company has entered into a lease for a small laboratory facility in a medical center in st louis for its scientific research staff  concentrating mainly on the identification and potential development of new product lines 
item legal proceedings a former employee  dr nicholas coppard  filed suit for summary judgement in the uk high court alleging wrongful dismissal and a claim for royalty entitlements relating to the company s msd product and the retention of his former option entitlement 
judgement in favour of the plaintiff was given in january on the wrongful dismissal claim  but no figure representing alleged damages has yet been agreed 
the judgement is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the royalty and options element of the claim  being the most substantial  were deferred for a full high court hearing which is likely to take place during the company strongly contests these claims and has prepared a vigorous defence in the event that matters come to trial 
an unsupported claim arising from the termination of an agreement covering the distribution of the kinetin product in certain countries in the far east has been made by the proposed distributor 
the company maintains that the terms of the agreement have not been complied with  and whilst the proposed distributor has contested the termination  no formal action has been taken such as a request for mediation with the american arbitration association 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable 
part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholders matters a general discussion since november  shares of the company had been traded on the over the counter market in the united kingdom at an extremely restricted level of activity 
the company was subsequently unable to retain the services of a substantial market maker and currently there is no established public trading market for the company s shares in the united kingdom 
american depositary shares of the company each representing one ordinary share and evidenced by one american depositary receipt were traded on the over the counter market in the united states from november and have been traded through the national association of securities dealers automated quotations nasdaq stock market system since the company s public offering in the us in may the following table sets out the range of high and low closing bid prices for the company s american depositary shares during each quarter of the company s two most recent fiscal years based upon the reports of the nasdaq smallcap stock market

the company has not paid  nor does it presently contemplate the payment of  any cash dividends on its ordinary shares 
the decision whether to pay  and the amount of such dividends  will be based upon  among other things  the earnings  capital requirements and financial conditions of the company

c taxation general the following is a summary of the principal us federal and uk tax consequences applicable to the ownership of ordinary shares and american depositary shares  by a beneficial holder that is a citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or partnership created or organized under the laws of the united states or any state thereof or that otherwise is subject to us federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the ordinary shares or american depositary shares a us holder 
this summary is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations  and us holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the overall tax consequences  including specifically the consequences under state and local laws  of the purchase  ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or american depositary shares 
this summary does not address the uk tax consequences to a us holder who is resident or in the case of an individual ordinarily resident in the united kingdom or who carries on business there through a branch or agency 
a disposition of ordinary shares or american depositary shares  by such a person may be subject to uk tax 
this summary also does not address the us tax consequences to a us holder i controlling  directly or indirectly  together with associates  or more of the voting shares of the company  ii who does not hold the ordinary shares or american depositary shares as capital assets  iii who does not use the us dollar as the us holder s functional currency or iv who holds the ordinary shares or american depositary shares as part of a larger integrated financial transaction or straddle 
the statements regarding us federal and uk tax laws set out below are based on those laws as in force on the date of this form k 
for the purposes of the current us uk double taxation conventions the income tax convention and for the purposes of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code  us holders of american depositary shares will be treated as owners of the underlying ordinary shares 
taxation of dividends no tax will be withheld from dividend payments by the company  but the company is generally required  when paying a dividend in respect of its ordinary shares or american depositary shares  to account to the uk inland revenue for advance corporation tax act at the rate of one quarter of the dividend which is equivalent to of the sum of the cash dividend and the act 
this rate is subject to change 
an individual shareholder resident in the united kingdom is treated for uk tax purposes as having taxable income equal to the sum of the dividend plus a tax credit equal to of the sum of the dividend plus the tax credit such aggregate sum being hereinafter referred to as the gross dividend 
the tax credit is available as a tax credit against the individual s tax liability on the relevant dividend and may  in appropriate cases  be refunded to such individual 
the income tax convention provides that  in general  a us resident shareholder will normally be entitled to a repayment the act repayment by the uk inland revenue of an amount equal to the tax credit to which an individual uk resident shareholder is entitled  subject to the deduction of an amount equal to of the gross dividend 
thus  a payment of a dividend of pound sterling to a us resident shareholder would result in the shareholder becoming entitled to a net repayment of pence  ie pound sterling of pound sterling less a deduction of pound sterling of pound sterling  being the sum of pound sterling and pound sterling a corporate us holder which is not also a resident of the uk for the purposes of the income tax convention is generally treated in the same way as an individual us holder unless the corporation controls  directly or indirectly either alone or with one or more associated corporations or more of the voting power of the company  in which case different provisions will apply 
if the us holder is a us partnership  trust or estate  the act repayment will be available only to the extent that the income derived by such partnership  trust or estate is subject to us tax as the income of a us resident either in its hands or in the hands of its partners or beneficiaries  as the case may be 
however  if a us trust or estate is also a resident of the uk for the purposes of the income tax convention the act repayment may not be available 
from april  the above regime will change for us shareholders who are entitled to the act repayment in respect of dividends received from the company 
the act repayment will be reduced to an amount equal to one ninth of the dividend 
while these changes do not take away a us holder s right to claim an act repayment in respect of dividends received from the company  the combined effect of uk withholding tax at the applicable rate and the decrease in the value of the act repayment will generally reduce or eliminate the refund to which a us holder is entitled in respect of dividends received on or after april in the event that the company want to make a dividend payment  it intends to enter into arrangements with the uk inland revenue so that  subject to certain exceptions  any act repayment due in respect of shares in american depositary share form may be paid to a us resident holder of an american depositary share provided that the holder completes the declaration of us residency on the reverse of the dividend check and presents the check for payment within three months from the date of issue of the check 
these arrangements are not available  among other cases  where the beneficial owners of american depositary shares are certain investment or holding companies or where the american depositary shares comprise property subject to certain estates or trusts 
these arrangements can be terminated without notice by the uk inland revenue 
shareholders not holding american depositary shares or not eligible for the special arrangements described in the preceding paragraph wishing to make a claim for act repayment should obtain claim forms from the internal revenue service  assistant commissioner international  l enfant plaza south  sw washington  sw  attention taxpayers services 
the first claim by a shareholder should be sent with the dividend counterfoils to the director of the internal revenue service center to which the shareholder s last us federal income tax return was filed 
the service center will then transmit the claim directly to the uk inland revenue financial intermediaries and claims office 
subsequent claims by the same shareholder should be filed directly with the uk inland revenue financial intermediaries and claims office  fitzroy house  po box  nottingham ng bd  england 
claim for an act repayment must be made within six years of the uk year of assessment months ending on april in each year in which the dividend is paid 
because a claim is not considered made until the uk tax authorities receive the appropriate form from the internal revenue service  the claim forms should be sent to the internal revenue service well before the end of the applicable limitations period 
the amount of any gross dividend paid to a holder who is a us holder ie pound sterling in the above example will be treated as dividend income to such us holder for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the company  as determined under us federal income tax principles 
such amount will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction otherwise allowed to us corporations 
the amount included in income with respect to a dividend on an ordinary share or american depositary shares will be the us dollar value of the payment determined at the spot rate on the date of such payment regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into us dollars 
generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuation between the date of a dividend payment and the date such payment is converted into us dollars will be us source ordinary income or loss 
subject to certain limitations  the uk deduction from the gross dividend as described above will be treated  for us federal income tax purpose  as a foreign income tax eligible for credit against such holder s us federal income tax 
the uk treasury has power to deny the payment of act repayments to certain corporations if they or an associated company have a qualifying presence in a state which operates a unitary system of corporate taxation 
such provisions will only come into force if appropriate uk statutory instruments are introduced 
none have so far been introduced 
however  it has been indicated that such provisions could be introduced retrospectively  thus applying to dividends paid on or before the date of implementation 
uk registration provides that when paying a dividend a company may elect for it to be classified as a foreign income dividend fid and in such a case may obtain a repayment of act to the extent that the dividend can be shown to have been paid out of foreign source profits 
it should be noted that the tax consequences of the payment of a fid are different to those set out in this section  in particular that the recipients of a fid are unable to claim a tax credit 
taxation of capital gains in general  holders of ordinary shares or american depositary shares who are us holders and who are not residents or ordinarily residents in the united kingdom will not normally be liable for uk taxation of capital gains realized or accrued on the disposal of their ordinary shares or american depositary shares 
however  for us federal income tax purposes  gain or loss  if any  on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or american depositary shares by a us holder will generally result in capital gain or loss to such us holder 
generally  a us holder s capital gain or loss will be a long term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares or american depositary shares have been held for more than one year 
capital gains realized or accrued on the disposition of shares will be us source gains for purposes of the us foreign tax credit limitation  while there is a substantial risk that capital losses will be foreign source by reference to the dividends received in respect of the ordinary shares and american depositary shares 
estate and gift taxation the current estate and gift tax convention between the united states and the united kingdom generally relieves from uk inheritance tax generally the equivalent of us federal estate and gift tax the transfer of ordinary shares or adrs provided the shareholder making the transfer is  for the purposes of the convention  domiciled in the united states and is not a national of the united kingdom  and the applicable us tax is paid 
a holder who is a us citizen or is domiciled in the united states will be subject to us federal estate and gift tax on such a transfer 
inheritance tax an adr held by an individual us holder who is domiciled in the united states for the purposes of the convention relating to estate and gift taxes the estate and gift tax convention and is not a national of the united kingdom for such purposes is not subject to uk inheritance tax on the individual s death or on a gift made by the individual during his lifetime except where the adr is part of the business property of a uk permanent establishment of the individual or pertains to a uk fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services 
the estate and gift tax convention generally provides for tax paid in the united kingdom to be credited against tax payable in the united states and for tax paid in the united states to be credited against any tax payable in the united kingdom  based on priority rules set forth in that convention in cases where an adr is subject both to uk inheritance tax and to us federal gift or estate tax 
there are special individual rules applying to trusts 
adrs held in trust created by a us holder will normally fall outside the scope of uk inheritance tax 
uk stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax the statements below relate to what is understood to be the current practice of the uk inland revenue under existing law 
provided that the instrument of transfer of american depositary shares is not executed in the united kingdom and remains at all times outside of the united kingdom  no uk stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of adrs 
neither will an arrangement to transfer american depositary shares in the form of adrs give rise to a liability for stamp duty reserve tax 
purchase of ordinary shares  as opposed to american depositary shares  will normally give rise to a charge to uk stamp duty at the rate of pence per pound sterling or part of the price 
an agreement to transfer ordinary shares gives rise to a charge to uk stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of of the price unless an instrument of transfer is duly stamped under the stamp duty legislation 
stamp duty reserve tax is generally the liability of the purchaser and stamp duty is also usually paid by the purchaser 
where such ordinary shares are later transferred to the depositary s nominee  further stamp duty will normally be payable at the rate of pound sterling per pound sterling or part of the price paid for or the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement  or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of  any tax or duty payable by the depositary or the custodian on deposits of ordinary shares will be charged by the depositary to the party to whom american depositary shares are delivered against such deposits 
a transfer of the underlying ordinary shares to an american depositary share holder upon cancellation of the american depositary shares without transfer of beneficial ownership will give rise to uk stamp duty at the rate of pence per transfer

to date  the company has realized only modest revenues from its operations and has  in the past  had to depend upon raising equity funds from private placements 
the company s most significant revenue commitments are its research grant agreements  consulting agreements  employment agreements and its property leases 
in addition  capital expenditure of approximately million on top of million already spent as at december  is envisaged during in connection with the purchase of additional plant and machinery in order to achieve capacity at a substantial level for the production and sub assembly of the company s reliaject tm components 
in the event of the use of kinetin as a pharmaceutical  as opposed to a cosmetic  product considerable additional expenditure would have to be committed and the speed at which this work can be undertaken will depend upon the company s financial resources 
the company anticipates spending approximately million through on the development of its pharmaceutical products  including reliaject tm applications and on its administrative and marketing structure generally 
although management believes that revenues from ccsi s trading activities  the sale of monoclonal antibodies  and from the sale of the company s invicorp tm product to named patients will be generated  these will not be sufficient to address the company s projected short term financial requirements 
on march   the company therefore entered into an agreement with windsor capital limited to procure additional funds through funding and financing arrangements that will include the issue of  p ordinary shares at a purchase price of per share under the terms and conditions of regulation s 
in addition to such share purchase  year warrants were issued entitling the subscriber to purchase a further  p ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share at any time from march  until march  funding and financing arrangements also include the establishment of a million line of credit on march  from the subscriber for the million equity issue with attached warrants issuable on each draw down of the facility that will entitle the lender to convert to ordinary shares 
additionally  certain of the holders of a substantial number of warrants of the company may exercise their right to convert their warrants into shares upon payment to the company of the conversion price as the conversion dates approach 
moreover  the company is planning the grant of licensing rights to its msd and kinetin products  and  if negotiated  any resulting agreements could represent substantial additional revenues through licensing fees  although no assurance can be given that any such agreements will be concluded in fiscal future prospects the company proposes to expedite the development and subsequent commercialization of the invicorp tm treatment  other potential product lines utilizing the reliaject tm device and the kinetin compound products either through its own resources or in co operation with one or more licensees 
the company is continuing to seek agreements with parties who have expressed interest in acquiring licensing rights for certain major territories and although discussions regarding license rights for certain geographical segments are in progress with several interested potential parties  there can be no assurance that agreements on acceptable terms will ultimately be effected with the parties concerned and at present  the company is not party to any such agreement 
the pre marketing costs of these activities are likely to be of a substantial nature 
the company s immediate objective is to achieve the granting of product licenses for its invicorp tm therapy in several european countries 
this will be followed by a selection of a rapporteur for a pan european licensing submission 
pending these developments  it is anticipated that sales  which at present are restricted to clinicians for use on a named patient basis  will continue to increase although income on this basis may not make a material contribution to the company s revenues in the current fiscal year 
the reliaject tm syringe has been fully developed and is available for commercialization and for testing purposes as a delivery system for the invicorp tm product and it is hoped may be utilized in conjunction with several new projects under review 
with regard to the development and marketing of ccsi s mill creek line and its associated products featuring kinetin  the acquisition of ccsi has provided the necessary marketing facilities for its incorporation into cosmetic products which  it is anticipated  in conjunction with the advertising campaign could make a positive contribution to the company s revenue during  although no assurance can be given as to the successful consummation of this objective 
management believes that existing inventory levels will suffice for the support of the expected increase in sales which could arise as a result of the advertising campaign 
the company is also in discussion with a number of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals companies regarding the out licensing of kinetin as a cosmeceutical product in its application to the area of anti aging 
the development plan for kinetin includes an allocation of funds for further anti aging clinical trials and pending the successful outcome of these trials  it may be feasible to enter into a licensing agreement towards the end of however  there can be no assurances that an agreement containing terms acceptable to both parties will be entered into 
in the case of monoclonal antibodies derived from the company s sponsored past research into alzheimer s disease  and from other sources  sales to scientific institutions were achieved at an increasing volume in  and whilst in future the amounts involved are unlikely to be substantial in relation to the company s over all objectives  it is anticipated that it should be possible to continue to achieve a flow of revenue at an acceptable level in fiscal it is not practicable at the present time to indicate the probable future operating results and equity capital requirements  but it is anticipated that growing revenues may be generated by the company during fiscal  and subsequently  from the trading results of ccsi including sales of cosmetic products which utilize the kinetin compound  from monoclonal antibodies  and from the possible licensing of the invicorp tm treatment and rights to the exploitation of the kinetin compound 
however  no assurances can be given that this course of events will transpire
