item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company entered into its current lines of business in november when it acquired eco environmental  and it has continued to expand its service capabilities  geographic presence and customer base primarily by acquiring other companies 
the company acquired nine businesses between fiscal and fiscal  and its revenues grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of such acquisitions 
in fiscal  the company accelerated its acquisition program by adding chempower and ccg  while disposing of eco environmental and environmental evolutions 
the company is reevaluating its continued interest in dominion bridge 
the company intends to continue to expand its business through the acquisition of companies in the industrial support and specialty fabrication businesses 
the company s acquisition strategy entails the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
the company s acquisition strategy has led to rapid growth in the company s operations over the past five fiscal years 
the company s operations generally are managed at each of its subsidiaries  but core administrative  financing and strategic planning functions are performed at the holding company level 
this rapid growth has increased  and may continue to increase  the operating complexity of the company as well as the level and responsibility for both existing and new management personnel at the holding company level 
the company s ability to manage its expansion effectively will require it to hire and retain new management personnel at the holding company level and to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems  and assuming the acquisition of dominion bridge  to integrate the operations of dominion bridge and to oversee its australian subsidiary 
the company s inability to effectively manage its expansion could have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations and financial results 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s revenues from its industrial  environmental and specialty fabrication segments may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors 
the effects of seasonality may be offset by the timing of large individual contracts  particularly if all or a substantial portion of the contracts fall within a one to two quarter period 
accordingly  the company s quarterly results may fluctuate and the results of one fiscal quarter should not be deemed to be representative of the results of any other quarter or for the full fiscal year 
recognition of revenues the company recognizes revenues and profits on contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  contract revenues are accrued based upon the percentage that accrued costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
as contacts can extend over more than one accounting period  revisions in estimated total costs and profits during the course of work are reflected during the period in which the facts requiring the revisions become know 
losses on contracts are charged to income in the period in which such losses are first determined 
the percentage of completion method of accounting can result in the recognition of either costs and estimated profits in excess of billings or billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts  which are classified as current assets and liabilities  respectively  in the company s balance sheet 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues the company s revenues grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of reporting the results of chempower from february   ccg from september  and a full year of operations for mm industra  srs and industra services which were acquired in fiscal these results are partially offset by a decrease in revenues from lake charles construction that generated million in revenues in fiscal from a single contract 
in addition  eco environmental and environmental evolutions were included only through their disposal date of august  during fiscal  the company generated approximately of its revenues from the provision of industrial support services and of its revenues from the provisions of such services to petroleum and petrochemical refining customers

management believes that the company s continued efforts to expand and diversify its customer base  in addition to the effects of a full year of operations from chempower and the operations of dominion bridge  assuming completion of such acquisition  will further reduce the company s dependence on certain key customers 
the company s industrial support segment generated million or of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal this increase in revenue is primarily the result of reporting chempower s revenues from february and the effect of a full year of revenue from industra and ccg s revenues from september  management anticipates that the revenues generated by its industrial support service segment will represent a larger percentage of revenues in fiscal as the company benefits from a full year of operations from chempower and ccg 
the revenues generated from the company s environmental services segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflects the sale of eco environmental and environmental evolutions on august  as a percentage of total revenues the company s environmental remediation service segment contributed approximately of total revenues of fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal the specialty fabrication business segment generated million or of the company s total revenues in fiscal  compared to million or in fiscal management anticipates that the increase in revenues from the company s specialty fabrication service segment will continue and this segment will contribute a greater percentage of the company s total revenues in fiscal as a result of increased business at mm industra  srs and chempower s controlled power division

management believes that the company will continue to be able to control operating expenses  but there can be no assurance that the company s cost control policies will be as effective in the future as they have been in the past  especially if the company completes the acquisition of dominion bridge  in which case it will be necessary to integrate operations  the cost of which cannot presently be estimated

information regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that such expectations will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements made herein include the ability of the company to continue to expand through acquisitions  the availability of capital to fund the company s expansion program  the ability of the company to manage its expansion effectively  any unexpected problems in connection with the proposed acquisition of dominion bridge  economic conditions that could affect demand for the company s services  the ability of the company to complete projects profitably and severe weather conditions that could delay projects 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have data sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other routine business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
based on presently available information  the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of these third parties to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s system rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project within one year  but no later than april the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows of the company 
of the total project cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software  which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
to date  the company has not incurred any expense for its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from such plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
