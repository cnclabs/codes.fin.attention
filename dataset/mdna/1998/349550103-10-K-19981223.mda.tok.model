recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
 which is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year  has not been determined 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires publicly held companies to report financial and other information about key revenue producing segments of the entity for which such information is available and is utilized by the chief operations decision maker 
specific information to be reported for individual segments includes profit or loss  certain revenue and expense items and total assets 
a reconciliation of page segment financial information to amounts reported in the financial statements would be provided 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year and the impact of adoption has not been determined 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for the company in fiscal year and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements  but the company believes there will not be a significant impact 
impact of the year issue the costs of the planned year modifications and the dates by which the company expects to complete its plans are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  changes in consulting fees and costs to remediate or replace hardware and software as well as non incremental costs resulting from redeployment of internal resources  timely responses to and corrections by third parties such as significant customers and suppliers  and similar uncertainties 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the issue arises if date sensitive software recognizes a date using as the year rather than the page year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s information technology systems consist primarily of hardware and software purchased from outside parties 
the vendor for the company s enterprise wide software has informed the company that the version of its software that the company is currently utilizing is year compliant and the company is currently testing to ensure that this is the case 
this testing phase is expected to be complete by early the company is in the process of addressing the year compliance of other software and hardware 
the company is utilizing a seven step process in addressing compliance of these other systems awareness  inventory of all systems and documentation  assessment to identify any areas of noncompliance  remediation renovation of any noncompliant systems  verification of compliance through testing and or vendor certification  implementation of any necessary changes revealed during verifications  and monitoring of the results of implementation 
the company is currently in the process of identifying areas of non compliance 
the company expects to have completed the entire process for its non enterprise software and hardware by the end of second quarter the company has begun the process of identifying and making inquiries of its significant suppliers and large public and private sector customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
the company expects that the process of making inquiries to these significant suppliers and customers will be ongoing through the end of however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies or public agencies with which the company does business will be timely converted  or that failure to convert by another company or public agency would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s most likely worst case year scenario would be an interruption in work or cash flow resulting from unanticipated problems encountered with the information systems of the company  or of any of the significant third parties with whom the company does business 
the company believes that the risk of significant business interruption due to unanticipated problems with its own systems is low based on the progress of the year project to page date 
if unforeseen internal disruptions occur  the company believes that its existing disaster recovery program  which includes the manual processing of certain key transactions  would significantly mitigate the impact 
the company s highest risk relates to significant suppliers or customers failing to remediate their year issues in a timely manner 
relating to its suppliers  the company has identified and will continue to identify alternative suppliers 
the company s suppliers are generally locally or regionally based  which tends to lessen the company s exposure from the lack of readiness of any single supplier 
the risk relating to the company s customers relates primarily to any delay in receipt of payment due to a customer s unresolved year issue 
the company s existing financial resources will help to mitigate such an impact and the company will continue to assess this risk as it receives communications about the year status of its customers 
the company estimates that costs to address the year issue will total approximately  including costs already incurred 
these estimated costs include consulting fees and costs to remediate or replace hardware and software as well as non incremental costs resulting from redeployment of internal resources 
to date  an insignificant amount has been incurred and expensed related to the year issue 
the company s year costs will be funded from its operating cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
 disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at september  a review of the company s other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that the company had exposure to interest rate risk 
at september   the company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flow
