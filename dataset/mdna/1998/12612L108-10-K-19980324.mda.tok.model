results of operations cna surety results from september  date of inception through december  and predecessor results for the nine months ended september  compared to predecessor year ended december  as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  the results of operations of the predecessor did not reflect investment income and investment gains and losses 
additionally  certain general and administrative expenses  which were indirect or overhead in nature  were not allocated to the predecessor by cnaf or its subsidiaries 
as a result of these factors and because the merger with capsure significantly affected the combined organization  it is not useful to compare cna surety operations to predecessor operations 
also  a comparison of the predecessor results of operations for the nine months ended september  to the year ended december  would not be useful due to the different reporting periods of nine and twelve months 
accordingly  the remainder of this discussion and analysis is formatted to compare information for cna surety for various time periods in and as if the merger had been consummated on january  periods presented prior to september  that are shown herein on this basis are therefore marked pro forma 
the following table of unaudited pro forma information has been prepared as if the acquisition of capsure had been consummated on january  this unaudited pro forma financial information gives effect to the following i adjustment to the capsure statement of operations  as reported  to reflect the income effects as if the per share special distribution was made on january   ii consummation of the merger and the related transactions and the contribution of capital to and the incurrence of additional debt by cna surety  iii purchase accounting adjustments to reflect capsure s assets and liabilities at fair value  iv estimated indirect and overhead expenses for the ccc surety operations  and v estimated interest expense related to the additional debt 
the unaudited pro forma financial information does not include the estimated net investment income resulting from investment of merger related cash flows  including i the million debt proceeds  ii the million capital contribution from ccc  and iii collection of the receivable from ccc 
analysis of cna surety s results for the three months ended and years ended december  and a discussion of cna surety s actual results of operations for the period from september  date of inception through december  compared to unaudited pro forma results of operations for the comparative period in and a discussion of unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended december  and follows 
the operating results of cna surety for the period from september  date of inception through december  are hereinafter referred to as the customarily subscribed to terms three months ended or fourth quarter 
the components of income for the company for the three months and years ended december  and are summarized as follows dollars in thousands three months ended years ended december  december  pro forma pro forma total revenues     underwriting income     net investment income     net investment gains  interest expense     non recurring charges and merger costs    amortization of intangible assets     income before income taxes     income taxes     net income     net income per share insurance underwriting underwriting results for the company for the three months and years ended december  and are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands three months ended december  years ended december  pro forma pro forma gross written premiums     net written premiums     net earned premiums     net losses and loss adjustment expenses     net commissions  brokerage and other     underwriting income     loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio premiums written cna surety primarily markets contract and commercial surety bonds 
contract bonds guarantee obligations covered by a written agreement between two parties 
the most common types include bid  performance and payment bonds 
the commercial surety market includes numerous types of bonds categorized as court judicial  court fiduciary  public official  license and permit and many miscellaneous bonds that include guarantees of financial performance 
the company also writes fidelity bonds which cover losses arising from employee dishonesty  and e o liability insurance 
gross written premiums are shown in the table below dollars in thousands three months ended december  years ended december  pro forma pro forma contract     commercial     fidelity     e o and other     gross written premiums increased  or million  in the fourth quarter ended december  compared to the fourth quarter of and gross written premiums increased  or million  for the year ended december  compared to these increases were primarily attributable to million of international surety and credit business assumed in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the company s initiative to more aggressively expand its products and services into the international markets 
in  cna surety expanded into the international surety and credit insurance market through a quota share reinsurance treaty with an affiliate of ccc  cna reinsurance company limited london 
commercial surety  exclusive of international surety and credit business  was up for the fourth quarter and in the fidelity and other book of business  primarily written by western surety  increased and in the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively 
these increases in commercial surety and fidelity and other business were offset by a decrease in contract surety business of in the fourth quarter and for the full year ended december  the decreases in contract surety reflect the competitive pressures primarily in the medium to large contract segment of the market and to a lesser extent  the timing of the contractor accounts being awarded new business by their customers 
net written premiums are shown in the table below dollars in thousands three months ended december  years ended december  pro forma pro forma contract     commercial     fidelity     e o and other     for the three months and year ended december   net written premiums increased  or million  and  or million  respectively  over the comparable period in net written premiums were up primarily due to a increase in commercial surety business for the full year of the increase in commercial net written premiums includes the addition of the aforementioned international surety and credit business as well as relatively strong growth in western surety s core small commercial surety business throughout net written premiums  exclusive of the international business  increased and for the three months and year ended december   respectively 
the rise in commercial net written premiums was offset by a decrease in contract surety net written premiums as a result of the competitive market conditions that exist in the contract surety market 
net written premiums for contract surety decreased  or million  for the quarter and were down slightly for the year ended december  the company also renegotiated its reinsurance agreements with its reinsurers increasing the company s net retention to million per principal eg  the contractor on contract surety bonds on its commercial surety business 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received million in previously ceded reinsurance premium from its reinsurers 
absent this returned premium  domestic commercial surety net written premiums were up for the quarter and for the year 
underwriting income underwriting income increased to million in the fourth quarter of and increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the similar periods in the period to period changes in underwriting income and combined ratios were due to fluctuations in both the loss and expense ratios as more fully described below 
loss ratio the loss ratio for the fourth quarter was compared to for the pro forma fourth quarter of the loss ratio included million and million in favorable reserve development for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the loss ratios for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the favorable reserve development impact of million and million in and  respectively  the loss ratios would have been and  respectively 
approximately million in favorable reserve development in relates to the predecessor as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the loss ratio is due to the ongoing favorable economic trends that continue to benefit the surety business in addition to more disciplined underwriting practices the company has adopted since the acquisition of cic by cnaf in may of expense ratio the expense ratio decreased to in the fourth quarter of compared to in the pro forma fourth quarter of the decline in the company s expense ratio for the quarter was largely due to the larger scale of the combined organization as net earned premiums advanced for the quarter while total underwriting expenses decreased 
the million decline in underwriting expenses on a pro forma basis for the quarter is not necessarily indicative of a trend management expects to continue near term 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for this decline was also primarily due to the increased scale of the company as net earned premiums increased and underwriting expenses increased only 
investment income net investment income was million for the fourth quarter of compared to million for the pro forma fourth quarter of pro forma net investment income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
increases in investment income for the quarter and in pro forma investment income for the year ended december  are the direct result of higher actual invested cash balances in the fourth quarter of which reflects the investment of merger related cash flows 
however  pro forma investment income for periods prior to the merger do not include the pro forma effects of estimated net investment income resulting from investment of merger related cash flows as described below 
the average pretax yield was for the three months ended december  the above unaudited pro forma financial information does not include the estimated net investment income resulting from investment of merger related cash flows  including i the million debt proceeds  ii the million capital contribution from ccc  and iii collection of the receivable from ccc 
investment earnings are an integral part of an insurance entity s operations 
if proceeds from these sources of funds were assumed to be invested in high quality  taxable fixed income securities with an average duration of approximately years  yielding  net investment income would increase approximately million million net of tax  or in pro forma earnings per share for the year ended december   and approximately million million net of tax  or in pro forma earnings per share and approximately million million net of tax  or in pro forma earnings per share for the three months and year ended december   respectively 
net realized investment gains were million in the fourth quarter of and pro forma net realized investment gains were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net realized investment gains on securities held at capsure s parent company were million for the year ended december  analysis of other operations amortization expense was million for the fourth quarter of and and million for the years ended december  and intangible assets represent goodwill and identified intangibles arising from the acquisition of capsure and goodwill arising from the may acquisition of cic by cnaf that was allocated to the surety business of cic 
intangible assets are generally amortized over years 
interest expense for the fourth quarter of increased compared to pro forma fourth quarter while the average outstanding debt was down to million in the fourth quarter of  the weighted average interest rate was compared to in the fourth quarter of pro forma interest expense decreased  or million  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt of million in compared to million in the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  capsure incurred million  after applicable income taxes  or per share  in merger costs in compared to million  after applicable income taxes  or per share in non recurring charges and merger costs in in the fourth quarter of  capsure incurred million  after applicable income taxes  or per share  in non recurring merger costs 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the quarter ended december  the effective income tax rate for the three months ended december  was 
income taxes were million and million and the effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective rate for the full year reflects the effects of limitations placed on the company s ability to utilize capsure s available nols to offset future taxable income 
lookback adjustment the reorganization agreement provides for a mechanism  referred to as the lookback adjustment  which may adjust the number of shares of cna surety common stock owned by cnaf operating companies in the event that either or both of capsure s and the ccc surety operations actual net written premiums for varied from certain targets 
application and interpretation of the provisions of the lookback adjustment are presently under review  the ultimate outcome of which is currently not known 
based on the facts currently available  the total number of shares of cna surety common stock will either not change or be reduced by approximately 
such a change in total outstanding shares would have no effect on net income  however  earnings per share for the period from september  date of inception through december  would have increased from to and the ownership of the company by cnaf operating companies would be reduced from to 
predecessor results of operations compared to premiums written net written premiums for the years ended december  and of ccc surety operations throughout the period and of cic subsequent to may   the date of acquisition  are shown in the table below dollars in thousands net written premiums contract   commercial   changes in net written premiums during this period were primarily due to the acquisition of cic in may of and  in  also due to changes in the reinsurance programs 
cic net written premiums have been included for approximately seven and one half months in the results and have been included for the full year in the results 
the more significant changes in the reinsurance programs were that contract surety retentions increased from million to million per principal effective january  similarly  commercial bond retentions increased from  to million effective january  these changes in the reinsurance arrangements were made as a result of the larger capital base of the combined operations  and allowed the ccc surety operations to lower reinsurance costs and retain additional amounts of surety premiums 
the increase in retentions in accounted for approximately of the total increase in net written premiums 
correspondingly  the increased retention by the ccc surety operations in part contributed to the reduction of ceded loss reserves which decreased from million at december  to million at december  although the ccc surety operations potential exposure increased as a result of the increased retentions  ccc surety operations management believed that  based upon the favorable loss experience with respect to such business  the retention of potentially profitable business offset such increased exposure 
due to the significant effect of the cic acquisition on the foregoing balances and changes in the reinsurance programs  it is more meaningful to review gross written premiums premiums written before ceded premiums during the periods ended december  and  for ccc and cic  as if they had been combined throughout this period dollars in thousands pro forma gross written premiums contract   commercial   combined gross written premiums in declined from the combined level by million 
this decrease was attributable in part to the continued program that commenced in to re underwrite the cic book of business on an account by account basis and remove business with unsatisfactory profit potential and risk 
to a lesser extent  a portion of the decrease is believed to be due to considerable management attention focused on effecting and completing the integration of cic and ccc 
the decrease in gross written premiums in was  this percentage decline was less than half of the percentage decrease 
operating results the following table is a summary of the pretax operating results of the ccc surety operations and certain operating ratios for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
as described in note to the accompanying financial statements  these pretax operating results do not include investment income  realized capital gains and losses  and certain indirect or overhead type expenses 
net earned premiums   net losses and loss adjustment expenses   other direct costs and expenses   excess of net earned premiums over direct operating expenses before income taxes   large losses   loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio effect of large losses on combined ratio does not include the effects of certain general and administrative expenses  which are indirect or overhead in nature  since such costs were not historically allocated to the ccc surety operations by cnaf or its subsidiaries 
accordingly  the comparability of this data to other data that include such costs is affected 
the year over year changes in the combined ratio was due to fluctuations in the loss ratio as more fully discussed in the following paragraph 
loss ratio the loss ratio was in  compared to in prior to the cic acquisition  the average loss ratio was approximately for the past ten years and for the past years 
this decrease in the loss ratio in compared to was attributable in part to the continued program that commenced in to re underwrite the cic book of business on an account by account basis and remove business with unsatisfactory profit potential and risk in addition to more disciplined underwriting practices the company has adopted since the acquisition of cic by cnaf in may of also in  large losses individual claims which are in excess of million  net of reinsurance were million in aggregate compared to million in these large losses had the effect of increasing loss ratios for and by and  respectively 
expense ratio the expense ratio was in  unchanged from liquidity and capital resources it is anticipated that the liquidity requirements of cna surety will be met primarily by funds generated from operations 
the principal operating cash flow sources are premiums  investment income  and sales and maturities of investments 
cna surety also may generate funds from additional borrowings under the credit facility described below 
the primary cash flow uses are payments for claims  operating expenses  debt service on the credit facility  as well as dividends  if any  to cna surety stockholders 
in general  surety operations generate premium collections from customers in advance of cash outlays for claims 
premiums are invested until such time as funds are required to pay claims and claims adjusting expenses 
the company believes that total invested assets  including cash and short term investments  are sufficient in the aggregate and have suitably scheduled maturities to satisfy all policy claims and other operating liabilities  including income tax sharing payments of its insurance subsidiaries 
at december   the carrying value of the company s insurance subsidiaries invested assets was comprised of million of fixed income securities  million of short term investments  million of other investments and million of cash 
cash flow at the parent company level is derived principally from dividend and tax sharing payments from its insurance subsidiaries 
the principal obligations at the parent company level are to service debt and pay operating expenses 
at december   the parent company s invested assets consisted of million of short term investments 
the company s consolidated net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the three months ended december  consolidated operating cash flow pretax income excluding net investment gains and amortization of intangibles assets for the three months ended december  was million 
the company received cash from cnaf on october  this payment from cnaf reflects the effects of the reinsurance agreement whereby ccc and cic ceded all of their net unearned premiums and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for their surety business to western surety as of the merger date 
cna surety s bank borrowings are under a five year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility that provides for borrowings of million 
cna surety borrowed million as of september  and used the proceeds to retire the existing capsure debt of approximately million and to make a million capital contribution to western surety 
on october   cna surety borrowed an additional million to pay the million closing dividend to capsure stockholders and other merger related costs 
the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility may be fixed  at cna surety s option  for a period of one  two  three  or six months and is based on  among other rates  the london interbank offered rate libor  plus the applicable margin 
the margin  including the facility fee  varies based on cna surety s leverage ratio debt to total capitalization and ranges from to 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate was on the million of outstanding borrowings 
the credit facility contains  among other conditions  limitations on cna surety with respect to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all restrictions and covenants contained in the credit facility agreement 
the credit facility provides for the payment of all outstanding principal balances after five years with no required principal payments prior to such time 
principal prepayments  if any  and interest payments are expected to be funded primarily through dividends from cna surety s insurance subsidiaries 
as an insurance holding company  cna surety is dependent upon dividends and other permitted payments from its insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends  if any  as well as to pay operating expenses and meet debt service requirements 
the payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of supervision by the insurance regulatory authorities in south dakota and texas 
in south dakota  where western surety and sbca are domiciled  insurance companies may only pay dividends from earned surplus excluding surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in texas  where usa is domiciled  an insurance company may only declare or pay dividends to stockholders from the insurer s earned surplus 
the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval only if such dividend or distribution together with dividends or distributions made within the preceding month period is less than  as of the end of the immediately preceding year  the greater of i of the insurer s surplus to policyholders and ii statutory net income 
in south dakota  net income includes net realized capital gains in an amount not to exceed of net unrealized capital gains 
all dividends must be reported to and approved by the appropriate insurance department prior to payment 
the dividends that may be paid without prior regulatory approval are determined by formulas established by the applicable insurance regulations  as described above 
the formulas that determine dividend capacity in the current year are dependent on  among other items  the prior year s ending statutory surplus and statutory net income 
accordingly  dividend capacity for does not fully reflect the effects of the merger 
dividend capacity for is based on statutory surplus and income at and for the year ended december  which will only include the results of the ccc surety operations for the period from september  date of inception through december  dividend capacity for will be based on statutory surplus and income at and for the year ended december  which will include the effects of the ccc surety operations for all of without prior regulatory approval in  cna surety s insurance subsidiaries may pay stockholder dividends of million in the aggregate 
in the fourth quarter of  cna surety received million in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
in accordance with the provisions of intercompany tax sharing agreements between cna surety and its subsidiaries  the tax of each subsidiary shall be determined based upon each subsidiary s separate return liability  as calculated in accordance with the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
intercompany tax payments are made at such times as estimated tax payments would be required by the internal revenue service irs 
cna surety received tax sharing payments from its subsidiaries of million in the period from september  through december  cna surety management believes that it will have sufficient available resources to meet its present capital needs 
financial condition investment portfolio the company s policy is to primarily invest in fixed income securities with high quality credit ratings 
as of december   approximately of the investment portfolio was held in high quality  short duration mortgage pass through instruments  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and other asset backed securities 
cmos differ from traditional fixed income securities in that they may expose the investor to yield variability and even principal risk due to such factors as high mortgage prepayment rates and defaults and delinquencies in the underlying asset pool 
management believes it has reduced prepayment variability by investing only in short tranches and by owning a substantial amount of planned amortization class pac tranches which have been structured largely to insulate the investor from prepayment risk 
a pac tranche is structured to amortize in a predictable manner and  therefore  the risk of prepayment of the underlying collateral is shifted to other tranches  whose owners are willing to accept such risk 
further  management believes it has minimized credit risk primarily by generally purchasing securities rated a or better on the date of acquisition and which are collateralized or guaranteed by us government agencies or have substantial credit enhancement in the form of financial guarantees  mortgage insurance  letters of credit  over collateralization  subordinated structures and excess servicing spreads 
management monitors the investment portfolio of the insurance subsidiaries and the current rating of each security owned on a monthly basis 
the following table sets forth the ratings assigned by the standard poors corporation s p or moody s investor services  inc moody s of the fixed income securities portfolio of the company as of december  dollars in thousands credit rating fair value percent aaa aaa  aa aa a a  bbb  total  as of december   of the company s fixed income securities were considered investment grade by the standard poors corporation or moody s investor services  inc  and were rated at least aa by those agencies 
in addition  the company s investments in fixed income securities did not contain any significant geographic or industry concentration of credit risk 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cna surety s insurance subsidiaries employs accepted reserving approaches in establishing the estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses that give consideration to the inherent difficulty and variability in the estimation process 
in addition  cna surety utilizes independent actuarial firms of national standing to conduct periodic reviews of claim procedures and loss reserving practices  and annually obtains actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the year in which such changes are determined to be needed 
the following table presents selected loss and loss adjustment expense information and highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years dollars in thousands september  date of predecessor inception nine years ended through months ended december  december  september  reserves at beginning of period gross     ceded reinsurance     net reserves at beginning of period     net reserves of cic at may   date of acquisition  total net reserves     net incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current period     decrease in provision for insured events of prior periods    total net incurred     net payments attributable to current period events     prior periods events    total net payments     net reserves of capsure at september   date of merger  net reserves at end of period     ceded reinsurance at end of period     gross reserves at end of period     amounts are for predecessor except for the net reserves of capsure and both ceded reinsurance and gross reserves at the end of the period which are for cna surety 
based on the ccc surety operations study of reserves  the ccc surety operations management determined that it had been overly cautious in interpreting claim data and had discounted favorable trends 
consistent with the ccc surety operations regular study of reserve levels  the ccc surety operations released million of prior year reserves in approximately million of this reserve development related to cic and principally to accident years prior to risked based capital rbc and other regulatory ratios the national association of insurance commissioners naic has promulgated rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc information is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning mechanism to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
generally  a ratio in excess of of authorized control level rbc requires no corrective actions on behalf of the company or regulators 
as of december   each of cna surety s insurance subsidiaries had a ratio that was in excess of the minimum rbc requirements 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries require capital to support premium writings 
in accordance with industry and regulatory guidelines  the net written premiums to surplus ratio of a property and casualty insurer should not exceed to the terms of the credit facility also limit this ratio to to for western surety and usa 
on december   the company had a combined statutory surplus of million 
western surety s statutory surplus was million and its net written premiums to surplus ratio was to usa s statutory surplus was million and its net written premiums to surplus ratio was to the company believes that each insurance company s statutory surplus is sufficient to support its current and anticipated premium levels 
the naic has also developed a rating system  the insurance regulatory information system iris  primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of all insurance companies operating within their respective states 
iris consists of eleven key financial ratios that address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability 
in  usa s iris ratios fell within all of the usual ranges 
due to the merger and related reinsurance transactions that occurred on september   western surety s net writings  surplus and agents balances increased significantly causing the applicable iris ratios to be outside the usual ranges 
all of the remaining iris ratios for western surety were normal 
impact of year on the company the widespread use of computer programs  both in the united states and internationally  that rely on two digit fields to perform computations and decision making functions may cause computer systems to malfunction when processing information involving dates after such malfunction could lead to business delays and disruptions 
the company is in the process of replacing or upgrading its systems to accommodate business for the year  and anticipates that by december  it will have substantially completed its program of replacements and the necessary upgrades to accommodate year processing of its business 
however  due to the interdependent nature of computer systems  the company may be adversely impacted depending upon whether it or other entities not affiliated with the company vendors and business partners address this issue successfully 
the cost of achieving year compliance is estimated to be less than million in excess of the cost of normal software upgrades and replacements and will primarily be incurred in although the company has not received any claims for coverage from its customers based on losses resulting from year issues  there can be no assurance that customers will not suffer losses of this type and seek compensation under the company s bonds or policies 
if any claims are made  coverage  if any will depend on the facts and circumstances of the claim and the provisions of the bond or policy 
at this time  the company is unable to determine whether the adverse impact  if any  in connection with the foregoing circumstances would be material to the company 
impact of adopting statements of financial accounting standards sfas in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
is effective for both interim and annual periods ending after december  sfas no 
replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 earnings per share 
apb opinion no 
required that entities with simple capital structures present a single earnings per common share eps on the face of the income statement  whereas those with complex capital structures had to present both primary and fully diluted eps 
sfas no 
simplifies the computation of eps by replacing the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps and requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps by entities with complex capital structures 
basic eps includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period  whereas primary eps includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents  such as stock options 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity  similar to fully diluted eps
