item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended november  and october  and overview in fiscal  photronics established its first operations outside of the united states by acquiring operations in oldham  uk  and in neuchatel  switzerland  opening a new manufacturing facility in singapore and acquiring a minority interest in an independent photomask manufacturer in korea 
in addition  during the company acquired an independent photomask manufacturer in dresden  germany 
these facilities  together with the company s five existing us facilities  comprised a global manufacturing network of ten facilities supporting semiconductor fabricators in the asian  european and north american markets 
as a result of the company s globalization  revenues from foreign operations increased to in  compared with in  and that trend is expected to continue 
individually  none of these acquisitions had a material effect on the result of operations in fiscal or see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the company s consolidated asian sales are denominated in us dollars resulting in minimal foreign currency exchange risk on transactions due to recent weaknesses in asian currencies 
revenues and costs also have been affected by the increased demand for higher technology photomasks which require more advanced manufacturing capabilities and generally command higher average selling prices 
to meet this demand and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing technology and capacity both at existing and new facilities 
since  the company has constructed four new manufacturing facilities 
in addition to the singapore facility  the company completed construction of its new state of the art facility in allen  texas  to which it relocated its dallas  texas operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of  the company completed construction of its new state of the art facility in manchester  uk  to which the former oldham  uk operation was relocated 
during  the company completed construction of a new manufacturing facility near austin  texas  which will be operational in early the company has also announced its plans to construct a new facility in hillsboro  oregon  which it expects to be operational in in addition  on december   the company acquired the internal photomask manufacturing operation of motorola  inc in mesa  arizona  and plans to relocate that operation to an independent facility in the mesa area by early see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended november  increased to million  compared with million in the prior year 
sales from photronics new international manufacturing operations accounted for approximately of the increase

net sales in fiscal represented an increase of over fiscal net sales of million 
the majority of the growth was from increased shipments to customers from existing facilities due to greater manufacturing capacity resulting from the company s capital expansion program  and from increased average selling prices due to a larger proportion of higher technology photomask shipments in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to the european acquisitions

sfas  earnings per share  which establishes new standards for the computation and disclosure of earnings per share eps 
the new statement requires dual presentation of basic eps and diluted eps

diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted 
the company cannot adopt sfas until the first quarter of fiscal the effect of sfas  had it been adopted beginning in fiscal  would have been to present basic eps that would have been greater than eps actually reported by for  by for and for the presentation of diluted eps would have been the same as eps actually reported for the respective periods 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no
