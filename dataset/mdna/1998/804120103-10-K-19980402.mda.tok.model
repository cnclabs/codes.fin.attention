borrowings under this facility generally will be made at the primary bank s prime rate of interest or a euro dollar based rate

the company had open commitments at such date related to letters of credit in the amount of  as of march    was available for borrowing under the short term demand line and  was available for borrowing under the revolving term line 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including restrictions on additional indebtedness  restrictions on the payment or declaration of dividends  a minimum tangible net worth  as defined  a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities  as defined  a minimum annual cash flow coverage ratio  that there be no demand loans outstanding under the demand line of credit for a period of at least consecutive days in each calendar year  and  fiscal quarter and annual net income requirements

on april   hyde issued to a life insurance company  of senior notes due april  the notes provide for semi annual payments of interest  payable in april and october of each year  continuing to april  and annual payments of principal of  each from april to and including april the note purchase agreement relating to the notes contains restrictive covenants commonly found in such agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company acquired an information technology hardware system at a cost of  pursuant to a long term capital lease 
the lease provides for a bargain purchase option at the conclusion of the lease term 
at january   the company had various commitments for capital expenditures  including information technology systems 
the company believes that these commitments are not significant 
the liquidity of the company is contingent upon a number of factors  principally the company s future operating results 
management believes that the company s current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet its working capital requirements and to fund its capital investment needs and debt service payments 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on the company s results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on the purchase of inventory by the company from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
the company  however  is subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of the company s foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign currency denominated payables 
the company has entered into certain forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize the transaction currency risk 
year the company has evaluated and documented the effect of the turn of the century on its computer hardware  operating systems and software applications 
a plan is in place to correct year problems in the company s long term  technical assets 
this plan is substantially funded by existing maintenance contracts and by normal  recurring upgrades to the computer systems 
correcting year problems in the company s long term technical assets will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the company has also considered the impact of the year issue on its customers and suppliers 
the footwear and apparel industry is less advanced  in terms of automation  than many other industries 
customers have shared their awareness of the year issue with the company  but have not provided management with formal year compliance reports 
the company s suppliers of raw materials and components are less technically sophisticated than the company s customers  often relying on personal computers and manual systems for their own business needs 
however  the apparel and footwear industry is characterized by numerous companies competing in an open market 
no customer makes up of sales volume 
purchase contracts and sources of supply can be negotiated and geographically moved within a six month period 
for these reasons  management does not expect a major disruption in supply of inventory or a major decline in customer purchases as the year approaches

the company expects to incorporate the added disclosure requirements of sfas into its form k filing for the fiscal year ending january  certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
competition 
competition is intense in the markets in which the company sells its products 
the company competes with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which have diversified products lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than those of the company 
the principal competitors for the company s saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors for the company s hind products are nike  pearl izumi and speedo 
the principal competitors for the company s quintana roo and merlin products are cannondale and trek 
dependence on foreign suppliers 
a number of manufacturers located in the far east  primarily in china  taiwan and thailand  supply products and product components to the company 
during fiscal  one of such suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of the company s total purchases by dollar volume 
the company is subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
in particular  there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  the company has no long term manufacturing agreements with its foreign suppliers and competes with other athletic shoe and recreational product companies  including companies that are much larger than the company  for access to production facilities 
foreign currency exchange 
from time to time  the company s financial results have been adversely affected by the fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to reduce currency exchange losses will be successful or that currency exchange rates will not have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing and shipment of individual orders  market acceptance of new athletic footwear and other products offered by the company  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  mix of products sold  changes in product pricing and general economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter  therefore  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact the results of operations for that quarter 
the company s current expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors  if that were to occur  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
management of growth 
one element of the company s business strategy is to seek acquisitions of businesses and products that are complementary to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any acquisitions  operate any such acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
in addition  identifying and effecting acquisitions and integrating the acquired businesses with the operations of the company may place significant demands upon the current management team and operational systems of the company 
in order to effect acquisitions of a certain size  the company may require additional capital  which the company may obtain through additional borrowings under its credit facility or otherwise 
dependence on consumer preferences 
the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business based upon fashion trends and frequently changing consumer style preferences and product demands  including levels of enthusiasm for athletic activities 
the company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
moreover  the company could be materially adversely affected by conditions in the retail industry in general  including consolidation and the resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
discretionary consumer spending 
purchases of bicycles  particularly high performance models such as those offered by the company  and the company s other products are discretionary for consumers 
the success of the company is influenced by a number of economic factors affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the company s growth and profitability 
advertising and marketing programs 
the company s success in the markets in which it competes depends in part upon the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs of the company 
in particular  the company must periodically design and successfully execute new and effective advertising and marketing programs 
dependence on major customers 
although the company had no customer that accounted for ten percent or more of the company s consolidated revenue during  the company s business is susceptible to the loss of certain key customers of the company s product lines  such as foot locker for the company s saucony products
