additionally  as stated above  the results for uslic and nslic were not included for the entire year 
in january   cica introduced a new line of international products known as the millennia series 
based on the early reception of these products by the company s marketing consultants  management believes the production of new premium from this market  which has been flat for the past few years  should experience significant growth  although this result cannot be assured 
additionally  the products previously sold by allic in the united states were not available following the merger of allic into cica until late in because of delays in obtaining requisite approval from state insurance regulatory authorities

it is management s belief that cica  utilizing the marketing representatives who previously represented allic  is better served to continue to exploit its niche selling specialty accident and health life products through existing distribution channels 
the acquisition of uslic and nslic also bring capable sales forces that have historically sold similar products  therefore management believes that the ability to cross sell products between companies is high 
net investment income increased during to  from  in in  such income was  the results reflect the continuing expansion of the company s asset base as well as the actions taken in previous years to change the mix and duration of the company s invested assets

allic represented  of s investment income  however  this amount represented only slightly more than three months of earnings on that asset base 
in  the contribution was million 
the low yields available in the bond market during the company s growth period have made it difficult to increase the return on the company s invested assets without exposing the portfolio to undue risk  however  management believes that as yields change  the company is positioned to take advantage of the investment opportunities that will present themselves and  thus  enhance future returns 
management hired the investment advisory firm of asset allocation and management  inc of chicago aam  illinois in late to manage the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
it is the belief of management that an overall increase in returns can be achieved by implementing the plans of aam to provide more diversity in the portfolio without significantly increasing risk

future policy benefit reserves increased  in  compared to  in and  in increased surrender activity was the primary reason for the lower reserve increases in and additionally  in the early years of a policy  the net reserves benefit reserve less deferred acquisition costs are small due to the large capitalized costs in the first and second policy years 
as the policy matures  the reserve increases 
the company s reserves are certified annually by an independent actuary 
such certification noted no deficiencies for the years presented 
overall policyholder dividends increased in amounting to  compared to  in and  in the growth is primarily due to the acquisition of uslic  which increased the current year results by approximately  in late  management reduced the dividends paid on various plans to reflect the lower levels of return that were available in the bond market 
as a result  the dividends paid in recent years have not been growing as rapidly 
virtually all cica s policies that have been sold since are participating 
participating policies represent a large majority of the company s business in force 
as a result  management expects continued growth in this item subject to factors such as persistency and future sales  however  dividends are factored into the policies premiums and thus management does not believe continued increases in dividend expense should impair or dilute future profitability 
claims and surrenders increased in  reaching  from  in in  such expenses were  death benefits increased to  in  compared to  in in  such benefits were  the increase in such claims in does not appear to be due to any trend 
rather  it is the result of the growing block of business written by the company

the company has historically adhered to a strict underwriting policy which requires complete medical examinations on all applicants who are foreign residents  except children  regardless of age or face amount of the policy applied for 
for and future years  management initiated a change to more selective medical examinations in conjunction with dry spot blood tests and extensive medical questions on the application in order to lower the cost of new business without sacrificing necessary information for the underwriter 
additionally  x rays and electrocardiograms are required depending on age and face amount of the policy 
on all policies of  or more  inspection reports are required which detail the background resources and lifestyle of the applicant 
the company has developed numerous contacts throughout latin america with which its underwriters can validate information contained in the application  medical or inspection report 
accident and health benefits grew to  in  compared to  in  and  in the increase reflects the growing block of accident and health premium on the company s books 
additionally  in  the addition of uslic contributed approximately  to the benefit amounts 
in  the acquisition of allic caused such benefits to increase sharply because of the volume of a h premium on allic s books compared to the amount on cica s books 
in  only three months of activity for allic are included 
endowment expense grew to  in from  in in  such expenses were  beginning in late  citizens introduced a new series of plans called ultra expansion plus which carried an immediate endowment benefit of an amount elected by the policyowner 
this endowment is factored into the premium of the policy and is paid annually 
the relatively small increase from to reflects the decreased production of new business over the last three years 
management does not expect this benefit to adversely impact profitability since it is factored into the cost of the policy 
policy surrenders were  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in surrenders in and is  in the opinion of management  due to acquisitions and the growing block of business in force  as well as representative of the economic problems seen in argentina during and early the decrease in is  in the opinion of management  the result of a campaign begun in mid to inform policyowners about the benefits of their policy 
other claim expenses amounted to  in   in and  in these expenses are comprised of supplemental contract benefits  interest on policy funds and assorted other miscellaneous policy benefits 
during  commissions decreased to  from  in in commissions were  the majority of such amounts paid relates to first year commissions which were   and  respectively  in   and the increases relate to improved sales activity in cica and approximately million associated with allic 
the decline in first year commissions during relates to the slowdown in new sales discussed earlier 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses decreased to  in from  in and  in the expenses include approximately million associated with allic 
due to the consolidation of allic s operations with cica  management believes significant reductions have been achieved through economies of scale which are reflected in the results 
it should be noted that only six months of expense associated with uslic and one month from nslic are included 
management believes that through economies of scale which can be achieved in the future after conversion of systems of these companies  additional expense reductions can be made 
in order to convert a majority of cica s marketing overhead from fixed to variable  management began discussions in early with an independent international marketing company to serve as managing agent for the company s international marketing activities 
this firm will receive an overriding commission on all new business sold internationally in exchange for the absorption of all marketing management and promotion activities 
by taking such actions  management believes a significant amount of fixed overhead can be converted to a variable expense in and thereafter 
management has utilized firms such as this in previous periods with great success at obtaining increases in sales and expense reductions 
additionally  management undertook the expense reductions associated with allic s marketing operations discussed previously 
these actions should result in additional annual overhead reduction in future periods based upon the level of expenditures 
capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs were  in  compared to  in and  in the decline in amounts in reflects the lower level of new sales experienced during the year  as well as the lower interest rate environment 
there was an adjustment of capitalization for and after issued policies to reflect the lower interest rates available to be earned on the company s investment portfolio compared to earlier years 
amortization of these costs was   and  respectively in   and the increased surrender activity discussed above contributed to the increased amortization in amortization of cost of insurance acquired and excess of cost over net assets acquired increased to  in from  in and  in the increase is attributable to the goodwill and cost of insurance recorded on the acquisitions of uslic  nslic  allic and iih 
because of the slowdown in sales activity on the part of the agency operations previously associated with allic  management is monitoring the goodwill associated with the acquisition of allic in should actual production levels be less than anticipated production  the potential exists that the company would have to charge off the goodwill associated with such decline 
management  in conjunction with its independent actuaries is monitoring this recoverability on a quarterly basis 
at december   all goodwill on the company s balance sheet was recoverable within the period of amortization 
because of the production by former allic agents discussed above  management believes that there should not be future issues associated with such goodwill recovery  however  in the event any such amount proved unrecoverable  a charge in the appropriate period will be booked 
liquidity and capital resources stockholders equity increased to  at december  from  in the acquisition of uslic and nslic and the income earned during the period were the primary reasons for the growth in equity during the increase in equity during the year was enhanced by the improvement in the market value approximately million  net of tax on the company s available for sale bond portfolio

information systems and the year the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year is generally referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based or date sensitive information 
the company is in the process of identifying all significant applications that will require modification to ensure year compliance 
internal resources will be used as necessary to make the required modifications and to test and verify year compliance 
due to the nature of the programming of the company s core processing systems  such date oriented issues are not a problem since the dates are stored as the number of days since the year  rather than as a two digit field 
accordingly a significant part of the company s efforts to ensure year compliance will be to obtain assurances from vendors that timely upgrades will be made available to make third party software year compliant 
additionally  the company will contact companies with whom it does business and upon whose systems the company may indirectly rely  to obtain assurances that such systems will be timely modified
