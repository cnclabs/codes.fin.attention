item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in this report which express belief  anticipation or expectation as well as other statements which are not historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those set forth under risk factors in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
compared to the components of the company s statements of income  expressed as percentage of total revenue  are as follows years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling  general and administrative special charge income loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes 
net income loss net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million in while sales showed a modest increase on a year to year basis  the company experienced volatility on a quarterly basis during both years 
sales for the nine month period ended september  increased over the same period for as the industry and the company recovered from the slowdown in the dram market experienced during the latter half of however  in the fourth quarter of  the company s sales fell from the prior quarter due partially to the financial crisis in asia that caused some customers to push out their required delivery dates 
international sales accounted for of the company s net sales in  compared to in non system sales remained relatively flat year to year  accounting for of revenue in  compared to in during  in response to the industry slowdown  the company incurred million in special charges during the third and fourth quarters as it restructured its operations to attain profitability at a decreased sales level 
these charges reflected capacity cost reductions  including reductions in headcount  write off of some manufacturing equipment and increased inventory reserves 
during  these measures resulted in lower expenses in cost of goods sold and r d 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  a two percentage point improvement compared to in improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of the restructuring were mitigated by pricing pressures  especially from asian customers 
the company s gross margins have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sales  unit page shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
the company anticipates that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in light of current market conditions 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to in on a dollar basis  r d expenses during decreased million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the restructuring 
the company serves markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing  and the company believes that it must continue to maintain its investment in r d to develop competitive products 
accordingly  the company anticipates that r d expenses may increase in the future 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales for the year ended december   compared to of net sales for included in sg a for was a write off of an outstanding receivable from a malaysian customer 
absent this bad debt expense  sg a expense would have increased only approximately  or from in  the company had million in other expense  compared to  in other income for the comparable period in as a result of the asian financial crisis and the devaluation of the korean won  the company incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of million during the fourth quarter of net interest expense for the year was  as compared to net interest income of  for as a result of higher outstanding short term borrowings and lower levels of invested cash and cash equivalents during the year 
during  the company provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets which were recorded in and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  resulting in a tax provision of million 
accordingly  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate of for the same period in due to the current market conditions  the fluctuation in the company s order rates in the last months  the company s continued reliance on one customer for a significant portion of its orders and that customer s recent announcements to reduce or delay semiconductor equipment purchases  the slowdown in the korean semiconductor market  the continued competitive market environment for the company s products  and the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment market  the company remains cautious about the prospects for its business over the next twelve months 
the company continues to make strategic investments in new product development and manufacturing improvements with a view of augmenting future performance by enhancing product offerings  however  such investment may adversely affect short term operating performance 
the company is also continuing its efforts to implement productivity improvements for future operating performance 
the company believes that the future economic environment could continue to lengthen the order and sales cycles for its products  causing it to continue to simultaneously book and ship some orders during the same quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategic efforts will be successful 
compared to net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million in the decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower tungsten cvd systems sales as a result of the overall slowdown of the dram market during the last months particularly in korea  offset by greater ion implantation mev system and non system sales 
foreign sales accounted for of the company s net sales in  compared to in in  non system sales increased when compared to non system sales during same period in gross margin for the year ended december  was  compared to in the decline in gross margin was primarily due to the shift in product sales mix from cvd system sales  which have higher gross margins  to mev system sales  which have lower gross margins  lower absorption of manufacturing costs as a result of lower sales volumes and higher service costs associated primarily with the opening of genus page korea  ltd 
the company s gross margins have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sales  unit shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to in on a dollar basis  r d expenses during increased million when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to investments in personnel  product development material costs and engineering tools for new product development 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to lower net sales in addition to the increased r d spending 
the company s r d expenses in and are net of software capitalization costs of  and  respectively 
sg a expenses were of net sales for the year ended december   compared to of net sales for the increase was primarily due to lower net sales 
on an absolute dollar basis  sg a expenses for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the decrease was due to lower payroll related costs associated with the reduction in force during the third and fourth quarters of and lower commission and incentive expenses 
during the year ended december   the company incurred special charges of million  relating primarily to capacity cost reductions in association with the company s reduction in personnel in the third and fourth quarters of  increased inventory reserves and the write off of property and equipment 
in  the company had  in other income  compared to  in other income for the comparable period in this decrease was principally due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and higher interest expense associated with lease financing 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a benefit compared to a benefit for the same period in the significant change in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the recognition of lower amounts of deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
a total of million was used in operating activities  primarily due to a growth in accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by increased accounts payable 
fourth quarter sales grew over the similar period in  resulting in increased accounts receivable 
inventory levels increased as several customer delivery dates were rescheduled from the fourth quarter of to early capital expenditures during  either by cash or capital lease obligations  were million and related primarily to acquisition of machinery and equipment for the company s r d and applications laboratories and leasehold improvements and equipment for the ion technology facility in newburyport  massachusetts 
the company financed these expenditures through new or existing lease lines 
furthermore  the company anticipates that additional capital expenditures  if any  during will be funded through existing working capital or lease financing 
proceeds from sale of common stock was million and net short term borrowings increased million from the company s primary source of funds at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
the company has a million revolving line of credit which is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and expires in june at december   the company had million in unused letters of credit and borrowings of million outstanding under the line of credit 
availability of borrowings is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory at december   the company s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was in excess of million 
a monthly borrowing base certificate is required by the bank 
page the company incurred operating losses during each of the two years in the period ended december  and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
additionally  the company s bank line of credit is scheduled to expire in june the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
in february  the company issued equity securities through a private placement of convertible preferred stock series a stock for gross proceeds of million 
upon fulfillment of certain conditions  the same investors in the company s series a stock have committed to providing additional equity financing 
assuming the company fulfills these conditions and receives the proceeds from this additional preferred stock financing and assuming the company is able to secure borrowings upon renewal of its existing bank line of credit or under a new line of credit  the company believes that its existing cash resources together with funds from this additional preferred stock financing and line of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s expected working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  the exact amount and timing of these working capital requirements and the company s ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by numerous factors  including the level of and gross margin on future sales  the payment terms extended to and by the company and the timing of capital expenditures 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that funds will be received or become available from the additional preferred stock financing or line of credit or that these funds  together with the company s existing cash resources  will be sufficient to implement the company s operating strategy or meet the company s other working capital requirements 
accordingly  the company may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  if and when needed  on terms that the company finds acceptable 
any additional equity or debt financing may involve substantial dilution to the company s shareholders  restrictive covenants or high interest costs 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy its cash requirements  it will be forced to curtail operations  dispose of assets or seek extended payment terms from its vendors 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce expenses or successfully complete other steps necessary to continue as a going concern 
such events would materially and adversely affect the value of the company s equity securities 
risk factors certain sections of management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in management s discussion and analysis and this risk factors section 
the discussion of these factors is incorporated by this reference as if said discussion was fully set forth in management s discussion and analysis 
historical performance 
although the company had net income of million and million in the years ended december  and  the company experienced losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of the company s inconsistent sales and operating results in recent years  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain consistent future revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis  or that the company will be able to maintain consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
reliance on international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of total net sales in the years ended  and  respectively 
in addition  net sales to south korean customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales during the same periods 
the company anticipates that international sales  including sales to south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales 
as a result  a significant portion of the company s sales will be subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s foreign system sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and the company does not engage in hedging transactions  the company s foreign sales are subject to the risks associated with unexpected changes in exchange rates  which could have the effect of making the company s products more or less expensive 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  the company has a wholly owned south korean subsidiary providing service and support to the installed base of customers and whose functional currency is the won 
as a result of the devaluation of the won in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a foreign exchange loss of million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur currency losses or gains in future quarters as the currency fluctuates 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are in asia 
recent turmoil in the asian financial markets has resulted in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
in addition  dram prices have fallen dramatically and may continue to do so as some asian ic manufacturers may be selling drams at less than cost in order to raise cash 
these developments may affect the company in several ways 
currency devaluation may make dollar denominated goods  such as the company s  more expensive for asian clients 
asian manufacturers may limit capital spending 
furthermore  the uncertainty of the dram market may cause manufacturers everywhere to delay capital spending plans 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of company customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
some of the company s south korean customers have rescheduled their required delivery dates for orders page previously placed and have announced delays in the facilitization of their new manufacturing areas 
in addition  some portion of ic fabrication plant construction has been subsidized by asian governments 
financial turmoil may weaken these governments willingness to continue such subsidies 
such developments could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on a small number of customers 
the company continued its efforts to expand its customer base in and was successful  with new customers in taiwan and north america 
historically  the company has relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its net sales 
in  two customers  samsung electronics company  ltd 
and innotech corporation accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  these same two customers accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
because the semiconductor manufacturing industry is concentrated in a limited number of generally larger companies  the company expects that a significant portion of its future product sales will be concentrated within a limited number of customers 
none of these customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase the company s products 
furthermore  sales to certain of these customers may decrease in the future when those customers complete their current semiconductor equipment purchasing requirements for new or expanded fabrication facilities 
the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from a significant customer  including reductions due to customer departures from recent buying patterns  market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing ics  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the company s business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and experiences periodic downturns  which have an adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment 
semiconductor industry downturns have adversely affected the company s revenues  operating margins and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues and operating results will not continue to be materially and adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the need for continued investment in r d  substantial capital equipment requirements and extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capability limits the company s ability to reduce expenses 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to attain profitability in the future 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems  many of which may be ordered and shipped during the same quarter 
the company s results of operations for a particular quarter could be adversely affected if anticipated orders  for even a small number of systems  were not received in time to enable shipment during the quarter  anticipated shipments were delayed or canceled by one or more customers or shipments were delayed due to manufacturing difficulties 
the company s revenue and operating results may also fluctuate due to the mix of products sold and the channel of distribution 
competition 
the semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment industry is highly competitive 
genus faces substantial competition throughout the world 
the company believes that to remain competitive  it will require significant financial resources in order to offer a broader range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and invest in product and process r d 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources  more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities  as well as greater name recognition than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
if the company s competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering mev or cvd products similar to those sold by the company  it would materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products to these manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully in the united states or worldwide 
the company faces direct competition in cvd wsix from applied materials  inc and tokyo electron  ltd 
in the mev page marketplace  the company s mev ion implantation systems compete with mev systems marketed by eaton corporation 
there can be no assurance that these or other competitors will not succeed in developing new technologies  offering products at lower prices than those of the company or obtaining market acceptance for products more rapidly than the company 
dependence on new products and processes 
the company believes that its future performance will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved process capabilities 
as a result  the company expects to continue to invest in r d 
the company also must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept the company s new products or that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing products and processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if the company is not successful in the development of advanced processes or equipment for manufacturers with whom it has formed strategic alliances  its ability to sell its products to those manufacturers would be adversely affected 
product concentration  rapid technological change 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of its mev ion implantation and wsix cvd systems 
the company estimates that the life cycle for these systems is generally three to five years 
the company believes that its future prospects will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved process capabilities 
as a result  the company expects to continue to make significant investments in r d 
the company also must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
there can be no assurance that future technologies  processes or product developments will not render the company s product offerings obsolete or that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing and future processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if the company is not successful in the development of advanced processes or equipment for manufacturers with whom it currently does business  its ability to sell its products to those manufacturers would be adversely affected 
dependence on key suppliers 
certain of the components and sub assemblies included in the company s products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
disruption or termination of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on independent distributors 
the company currently sells and supports its mev ion implantation and cvd products through direct sales and customer support organizations in the us  western europe and south korea and through five exclusive sales representatives and distributors in the us  japan  taiwan and singapore 
although the company believes that alternative sources of distribution are available  the disruption or termination of its existing distributor relationships could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price  effect of conversion of series a stock on the stock price 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of  or announcements by  the company  its competitors or its customers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
also  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions in the united states and the countries in which the company does business  may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  trading in the stock is thin and because the series a stock is convertible at a discount to the market price  the holders of series a stock can convert the series a stock into common stock and sell such common stock at a profit at any time  which may have a depressive effect on the stock price 
in addition  the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on such market price 
readiness for year many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
these computer systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer service  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks page and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company also relies on external systems of business enterprises such as customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governments both domestically and globally  directly for accurate exchange of data and indirectly 
during  the company started the implementation of a new business system 
one criteria for the selection of the enterprise software was compliance with year issues 
accordingly  the company s current estimate is that the costs associated with the year issue  and the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue  will not have a material adverse affect on the result of operations or financial position of the company in any given year 
however  despite the company s efforts to address the year impact on its internal systems  there can be no assurance that the company has fully identified such impact or that it can resolve it without disruption of its business and without incurring significant expense 
in addition  even if the internal systems of the company are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected through disruption in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts
