this section provides supplemental information which should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the financial review is divided into three subsections entitled earnings analysis  financial condition  and liquidity and capital resources 
information therein should facilitate a better understanding of the major factors and trends which affect the company s earnings performance and financial condition  and how the company s performance during compares with prior years

the subsidiary bank is referred to as the bank or ccb 
the year to date averages used in this report are based on daily balances for each respective year 
annual averages in and are significantly impacted by the acquisition of first financial 
the averages include the addition of first financial for only six months in versus a full twelve months in in certain circumstances  comparing average balances for the fourth quarter of consecutive years may be more meaningful than simply analyzing year to date averages 
therefore  where appropriate  fourth quarter averages have been presented for analysis and have been noted as such

the effective tax rate was in  in  and in these rates differ from the statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the decreasing level of tax exempt income relative to pre tax income and an increase in the statutory tax rate for income greater than million

loan growth in was funded primarily through maturities in the investment portfolio 
all annual averages have been significantly impacted by the acquisition of first financial 
due to the timing of the acquisition  july   the averages for reflect the acquisition for only six of the twelve months  whereas a full twelve months is reflected in table provides information on average balances while table highlights the changing mix of the company s earning assets over the last three years 
loans local markets were generally improved during loan demand was steady and growth was spread evenly throughout the year 
the first financial acquisition completed in increased the number of markets served and enhanced the company s line of mortgage products and services 
price and product competition remained strong during and there continues to be an increased demand for fixed rate financing 
real estate lending  an area of primary focus  continued to improve 
other areas reflecting stronger demand included home equity and indirect automobile lending 
the company continues to place an increased emphasis on product marketing 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to grow the company s loan portfolio  it can do so only by adhering to sound banking principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
management consistently strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings

as a percent of the total portfolio  loans with a fixed interest rate have increased slightly from in to in allowance for loan losses management attempts to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the evaluations are based on the collectibility of loans and take into consideration such factors as growth and composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of potential losses  past loss experience and general economic conditions 
as part of these evaluations  management reviews all loans which have been classified internally or through regulatory examination and  if appropriate  allocates a specific reserve to each of these individual loans 
further  management establishes a general reserve to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio which are not specifically identified 
the general reserve is based upon management s evaluation of the current and forecasted operating and economic environment coupled with historical experience 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves plus the general reserve and adjustments are made  as appropriate

when establishing the allowance  management makes various estimates regarding the value of collateral and future economic events 
actual experience may differ from these estimates 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december   is adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio as of year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for each of the past five years 
the allocation of the allowance is developed using management s best estimates based upon available information such as regulatory examinations  internal loan reviews and historical data and trends 
the allocation by loan category reflects a base level allocation derived primarily by analyzing the level of problem loans  specific reserves and historical charge off data 
current and forecasted economic conditions  and other judgmental factors which cannot be easily quantified eg concentrations are not presumed to be included in the base level allocations  but instead are covered by the unallocated portion of the reserve 
the company faces a geographic concentration as well as a concentration in real estate lending 
both risks are cyclical in nature and must be considered in establishing the overall allowance for loan losses 
reserves in excess of the base level reserves are maintained in order to properly reserve for the losses inherent in the company s portfolio due to these concentrations and anticipated periods of economic difficulties

nonperforming assets to capital reserve to nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to share owners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
the majority of nonaccrual loans are collateralized with real estate 
management continually reviews these loans and believes specific reserve allocations are sufficient to cover the loss exposure associated with these loans 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december  restructured loans are those with reduced interest rates or deferred payment terms due to deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
other real estate totaled million at december  versus million at december  this category includes property owned by capital city bank which was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  the company added properties totaling million including parcels of bank premises and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net decrease in other real estate of  management does not anticipate any significant losses associated with other real estate 
potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amounts exceed of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
further  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio is associated either directly or indirectly with real estate 
at december   approximately of the portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
residential properties comprise approximately of the real estate portfolio 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management will continue to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities due to strong competition for deposits  proceeds from maturities in the investment portfolio have been used to fund loan growth rather than purchase additional securities 
in  the company s average investment portfolio decreased million  or  compared to an increase of million  or in as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in  average taxable investments decreased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
since the enactment of the tax reform act of  which significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt investments  management has monitored the level of tax exempt investments 
the tax exempt portfolio  as a percent of average earning assets  has declined from in to in management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
securities may be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
following a determination by the regulatory agencies during that the net unrealized gain loss would be excluded from the computation of regulatory capital  management transferred all securities classified as held to maturity to available for sale 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are recorded  net of tax  as a separate component of share owners equity 
at december   share owners equity included a net unrealized gain of  compared to  at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

as of december   the company has a million credit facility under which million is currently available 
the facility offers the company an unsecured  revolving line of credit for a period of three years which matures in november upon expiration of the revolving line of credit  the outstanding balance may be converted to a term loan and repaid over a period of seven years 
the term loan is to be secured by stock of a subsidiary bank equal to at least of the principal balance of the term loan 
the company  at its option  may select from various loan rates including prime  libor or the certificate of deposit cd rate  plus or minus increments thereof 
the libor or cd rates may be fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company also has the option to select fixed rates for periods of one through five years

the company s credit facility imposes certain limitations on the level of the company s equity capital  and federal and state regulatory agencies have established regulations which govern the payment of dividends to a bank holding company by its bank subsidiaries 
based on the company s current financial condition  these limitations and or regulations do not impair the company s ability to meet its cash obligations or limit the company s ability to pay future dividends on its common stock 
at december   the company had million in long term debt outstanding to the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the debt consists of two loans 
the interest rates are fixed and the weighted average rate at december  was 
required annual principal reductions approximate  with the remaining balances due at maturity in and the debt was used to match fund selected lending activities and is secured by first mortgage residential real estate loans which are included in the company s loan portfolio 
the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
it is anticipated capital expenditures will approximate to million over the next twelve months 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing the company s ability to meet its on going obligations

the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments

capital city bank group s asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company is currently liability sensitive which generally indicates that in a period of rising interest rates the net interest margin will be adversely impacted as the velocity and or volume of liabilities being repriced exceeds assets 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income
