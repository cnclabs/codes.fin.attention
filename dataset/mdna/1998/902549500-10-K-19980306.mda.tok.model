the employees equity interest is being allocated to individual employee accounts through the year under employee stock ownership plans esops which were created as part of the recapitalization 
since the esop shares are being allocated over time  the current ownership interest held by employees is substantially less than 
the entire esop voting interest is currently exercisable  which is voted by the esop trustee at the direction of  and on behalf of  the employees participating in the esops

as of december   ual had a working capital deficit of billion as compared to billion at december  historically  ual has operated with a working capital deficit and  as in the past  ual expects to meet all of its obligations as they become due 
in addition  ual may from time to time repurchase on the open market  in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise  debentures or preferred stock

of this amount an estimated billion is due to be spent in these amounts do not include a recent order with airbus industrie for an additional a and a aircraft to be delivered through the aircraft included in this latest order are expected to be used to satisfy growth opportunities  and thus  the company now expects its passenger fleet to grow by at least aircraft by the year for further details  see note commitments  contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements

in addition  includes an after tax gain on the ats galileo transaction see sale of affiliate of million per share  basic and per share  diluted 
the per share amounts for include the effects on equity of preferred stock transactions see note per share amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that a more complete understanding of ual s results can be gained by viewing them on a pro forma  fully distributed basis 
this approach considers all esop shares which will ultimately be distributed to employees throughout the esop period rather than just the shares committed to be released to be immediately outstanding and thus fully distributed 
consistent with this method  the esop compensation expense is excluded from fully distributed net earnings  and esop convertible preferred stock dividends are not deducted from earnings attributable to common stockholders 
no adjustments are made to fully distributed earnings to reflect future salary increases 
a comparison of results reported on a fully distributed basis to results reported under generally accepted accounting principles gaap is as follows december  december  gaap fully gaap fully diluted distributed diluted distributed net income  per share earnings before preferred stock transactions  gains on sales and extraordinary loss gains on sales of ats galileo  net preferred stock transactions  net extraordinary loss  net compared with operating revenues 
operating revenues increased billion and united s revenue per available seat mile unit revenue increased to cents 
passenger revenues increased million due to a increase in united s revenue passenger miles and a increase in yield to cents 
available seat miles across the system were up year over year resulting in a slight increase to system passenger load factor of points to 
the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the us department of transportation dot latin american revenue passenger miles increased  despite no increase in capacity 
strengthening economies in latin american countries as well as an improved mix of high yield passengers helped produce an increase in yield 
atlantic revenue passenger miles increased on higher capacity reflecting increased frequencies and the utilization of larger b aircraft 
strong us and european economies provided a positive pricing environment resulting in a increase in atlantic yield 
pacific revenue passenger miles and yield remained flat despite higher capacity reflecting a weak japanese economy and a stronger us dollar 
domestic revenue passenger miles increased on higher capacity 
domestic yield increased  despite the fact that the us airline ticket tax was in effect for only four months of versus ten months of new legislation  effective october   includes a gradual reduction in the us airline ticket tax to by the year  a phasing in of a head tax per domestic flight segment over the same period  an increase in round trip international departure and arrival taxes from to per passenger and a tax on the purchase of frequent flyer miles

cargo revenues increased million on increases of in freight ton miles and in mail ton miles  as a result of a new dedicated freighter operation utilizing four dc s and the introduction of long range b b aircraft 
a lower freight yield was only partially offset by a higher mail yield for an overall decrease in cargo yield of 
other operating revenues increased million due to increases in frequent flyer program partner related revenues and fuel sales to third parties  partially offset by the loss of ats revenues resulting from its sale in july see sale of affiliate 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million and united s cost per available seat mile increased from to cents  including esop compensation expense 
without the esop compensation expense  united s cost per available seat mile would have been cents  an increase of less than from esop compensation expense increased million  reflecting the increase in the estimated average fair value of esop stock committed to be released to employees as a result of ual s higher common stock price 
salaries and related costs increased million as a result of increased staffing in certain customer contact positions  as well as mid term wage adjustments which took effect july commissions increased million due to increased commissionable revenues  partially offset by the change in the commission structure which united implemented in the third quarter of united lowered the base commission paid to travel agents from to up to a maximum of on all tickets purchased in the us and canada for both domestic and international travel

united s revenue per available seat mile increased to cents 
passenger revenues increased billion due to a increase in united s revenue passenger miles and a increase in yield to cents 
the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the dot yield increases in the domestic  atlantic and latin american markets were partially offset by a decrease in pacific yield 
domestic yield increased as a result of a larger proportion of high yield business traffic and fare levels influenced by the expiration of the federal passenger excise tax from january through august 
a weaker japanese yen versus the dollar had a significant negative impact on pacific yield 
both domestic and international revenue passenger miles increased by 
available seat miles increased for the system  reflecting increases of in the pacific and latin american and in domestic markets

operating expenses increased billion 
united s cost per available seat mile increased from cents to cents 
esop compensation expense increased million  reflecting the increase in the estimated average fair value of esop stock committed to be released to employees as a result of ual s higher common stock price 
aircraft fuel increased million due to a increase in consumption and a increase in the average price per gallon of fuel from cents to cents 
without the increases in esop compensation expense and aircraft fuel  united s cost per available seat mile would have increased

commissions were flat year over year despite an increase in commissionable revenues due to lower average commission rates 
these lower rates were partially attributable to the full year effects of a new travel agent commission plan introduced in aircraft rent decreased million due to the acquisition of aircraft off lease in the second half of other income and expense 
other expense amounted to million in compared to million in interest capitalized  primarily on aircraft advance payments  increased million 
interest expense decreased million due to the prepayment of long term debt in and and the conversion of convertible debentures in the second quarter of interest income decreased million due to lower investment balances 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased million due to higher earnings from galileo international resulting from increased booking revenues 
included in other expense for is a million charge for the settlement of litigation related to the travel agency commission cap implemented by the company in other information sale of affiliate in july  united completed the sale of its interest in the apollo travel services partnership ats  a owned affiliate whose accounts were consolidated  to galileo international  inc galileo  heretofore a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
of this amount  million was recognized during the third quarter and the balance will be recognized over the next years  the estimated remaining life of the assets acquired by galileo 
galileo raised a portion of the proceeds used to purchase ats through the completion of an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  representing of its economic interest  at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
this transaction resulted in a reduction of the company s ownership in galileo from to 
in accordance with the company s policy of recognizing gains or losses on the sale of a subsidiary s stock  based on the difference between the offering price and the company s carrying amount of such stock  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million during the third quarter 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company also recorded million of deferred taxes related to this gain 
in connection with the sale  united entered into an additional services agreement under which the company will provide certain marketing and other services designed to increase the competitiveness of galileo s business and to generate additional bookings and revenues for galileo 
under this agreement  united could receive up to million on a present value basis in the sixth year following the sale  based on specified improvements in air booking revenues over a five year period 
united continues to account for galileo under the equity method and will continue to purchase computer reservations services under its existing services agreement with galileo 
labor agreements and wage adjustments the recapitalization resulted in new labor agreements for certain employee groups and a new corporate governance structure  which was designed to achieve balance between the various employee owner groups and public stockholders 
the labor agreements and governance structure could inhibit management s ability to alter strategy in a volatile  competitive industry by restricting certain operating and financing activities  including the sale of assets  the issuance of equity securities and the ability to furlough employees 
consistent with the various agreements supporting the july recapitalization  in employees represented by the air line pilots association  international alpa and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam ratified mid term wage adjustments providing for increases in wage rates in july and further  the agreement with alpa calls for a corresponding increase in both and to book rates book rates are used to compute certain other employee benefits  and the agreement with the iam provided for lump sum payments for all iam employees and increases in hourly license premium and skill pay for mechanics 
these agreements also provide for restoration of wage rates for the two groups in the year to levels that existed prior to the recapitalization in july  as well as restoration of the company s contribution to the pilots defined contribution plan from its current rate of to its pre esop rate of in the year also during the year  the company announced the details of the mid term wage adjustments for united states salaried and management employees 
salaried employees received a increase in july  as well as a lump sum payment  and will receive an additional increase in july management employees received a increase in july  and will receive an additional increase in july also  management employees not participating in the company s incentive compensation plan will participate in a three year profit sharing plan that could pay an additional amount in and  if the company meets specific pre tax earnings objectives in and  respectively 
these employees already received the maximum annual profit sharing payout  of annual wages  in february  based on s financial performance 
on october   the association of flight attendants afa ratified a new contract which will remain in effect through march  included in the contract was a lump sum payment of in december and future lump sum payments of in december and and in  and  as well as minimum wage increases in  and additionally  the contract includes a series of arbitrations beginning in which can award additional compensation increases  subject to meeting vision goals as discussed below 
the agreement also provides for benefits and work rule changes and a number of service quality and productivity enhancements designed to help the company achieve its customer satisfaction objectives 
the wage  benefit and work rule adjustments outlined above are consistent with the company s objective  known as vision  to put employee compensation on a competitive level with peer group compensation at the conclusion of the agreements outlined above 
the ultimate cost to the company of vision  particularly given that peer group compensation is subject to change between now and the conclusion of the agreements  is not determinable 
however  as a result of these changes  the company expects that its annual salaries and related costs will increase at a faster rate than its major competitors from now through the year foreign operations united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
these expenses include aircraft leases  commissions  catering  personnel costs  reservation and ticket office services  customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through changes in foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
despite the adverse favorable effects a strengthening weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic  a strengthening weakening of foreign currencies tends to increase decrease reported revenue and operating income because united s foreign currency denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency denominated operating expense for each currency 
by carrying passengers and cargo in both directions between the us and almost every major economic region in the world and by selling its services in each local country  united attempts to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in any single foreign currency 
the company s biggest net exposures are typically for japanese yen  hong kong dollars and australian dollars 
during  yen denominated operating revenue net of yen denominated operating expense was approximately billion yen approximately million  hong kong dollar denominated operating revenue net of hong kong dollar denominated operating expense was approximately  million hong kong dollars approximately million and australian dollar denominated operating revenue net of australian dollar denominated operating expense was approximately million australian dollars approximately million 
united hedges some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future net yen and net hong kong dollar cash flows by purchasing put options for each respective currency 
to reduce some of the costs of this hedging program  the company also sells call options in each currency from time to time 
united attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting excess local currencies generated to us dollars and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts 
the total notional amount of outstanding currency options and forward exchange contracts  and their respective fair market values as of december   are summarized in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk united s foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of physical assets  however  there are sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of foreign route authorities 
operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the united states and foreign countries 
changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of united s international route authority 
significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on ual s operating revenues and results of operations 
in january  the governments of japan and the united states announced details of a new four year aviation agreement which liberalizes the aviation market between the us and japan 
under the accord  united has been designated an incumbent carrier and as such  will be permitted to offer service between any points in the us and any points in japan and will also be entitled to fly beyond japan to other points in asia without restriction 
further  united will be able to code share flights with japanese  third country or other us airlines if it chooses 
while these rights give more flexibility to the company than it had under the previous us japan aviation agreement  many of united s competitors also received benefits in the form of greater access to the us japan market 
further  access to tokyo s narita airport is constrained by current capacity limitations on takeoff and landing slots 
thus  while supportive of the new agreement  the company is unable to predict what overall effect  if any  the new agreement will have on its future financial results as long as the current capacity limitations at narita are in existence 
however  upon completion of a second runway at narita  the company expects the current capacity limitations to be relaxed and believes it will be able to realize significant financial benefits as a result of the flexibility received under the new us japan aviation agreement 
deferred tax assets ual s consolidated balance sheet at december  includes a net deferred tax asset of million  compared to million at december  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately billion of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets include  among other things  million related to obligations for postretirement and other employee benefits  million related to gains on sales and leasebacks  million related to rent expense and million related to alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards 
management believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets at december  airport rents and landing fees united is charged facility rental and landing fees at virtually every airport at which it operates 
in recent years  many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increasing demands upon airport revenues 
airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation and in some cases have not been successful 
the federal aviation administration faa and the dot have instituted an administrative hearing process to judge whether rate increases are legal and valid 
however  to the extent the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted  the rates charged by airports may increase substantially 
management cannot predict the magnitude of any such increase 
year compliance over the next two years  most large companies will face a potentially serious business problem because many software applications and computer equipment developed in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could cause computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data 
united began taking measures to address this problem in late and has created a year project office  headed by a senior officer of the company  to manage and coordinate the company s efforts to identify and fix critical date sensitive systems 
the scope of the company s efforts is divided into two major phases  review of internally used software as well as review of other potential operational impacts and relationships with key business partners 
the status of the company s efforts in each of these areas is as follows the company has completed its assessment of over  mainframe based and network based programs used internally in connection with key business applications  and has estimated that it will cost approximately million to modify these programs to make them year compliant 
through december   million has been spent and recognized as expense in the company s results of operations 
the company s plan is to have all applications not compliant as of december  modified and tested by december  united has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of year on operational systems such as aircraft avionics  flight simulators and airport operations as well as relationships with key business partners  including the faa  other governmental agencies and suppliers 
this assessment involves a five stage process identification  assessment of impacts  development of remediation approach  prioritization of efforts  and testing and implementation of remediation approach 
the company will carry out this task through a company wide effort  assisted by consultants  to address internal issues  and jointly with industry trade groups  to address issues related to key business partners which are common to other air carriers 
the company has not completed the development of the remediation approach for all affected areas 
as a result  the company cannot estimate what the total cost will be to implement remediation efforts for all critical operational systems but it is possible that such costs will be material 
the company expects to complete the assessment and development stages of this plan by september  at which time it expects to be able to make a reasonable cost estimate 
implementation of all remediation efforts is scheduled to be completed by march  the company has started an ongoing program to review the status of key supplier year compliance efforts 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to assure year compliance  it is dependent on key business partner compliance to some extent 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without costs that might affect future financial results or cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
environmental and legal contingencies united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency epa cleanup sites which have been designated as superfund sites 
united s alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal  however  at sites where the epa has commenced litigation  potential liability is joint and several 
additionally  united has participated and is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites  primarily airports 
the estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that united is liable 
such accruals have not been material 
environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change  and determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and remediation experience 
therefore  the ultimate cost cannot be determined at this time 
however  while such cost may vary from united s current estimate  united believes the difference between its accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material 
ual has certain other contingencies resulting from this and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of such contingencies and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect ual s financial condition  operating results or liquidity 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements  and sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits which revises disclosure requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
each of these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
outlook for the recent economic downturn in asia  where currency devaluations and debt crises have negatively affected growth through most of the region and pushed some countries into recession  has caused a fall off in pacific revenue passenger miles through the first two months of the year 
as a result  the company expects full year system revenues to be lower than originally planned when it released revenue and cost guidance last december 
in keeping with the company s contingency planning  united is taking steps to respond to and offset the effects on profits from the weakness of the asian market 
these measures include the reallocation of capacity and the revision of discretionary spending plans 
furthermore  some costs  such as fuel  are expected to be below earlier estimates  resulting in lower than previously anticipated full year expenses 
all factors considered  the company anticipates continued strong performance in real gross domestic product in the us is assumed to continue to grow moderately at a rate of about and the system capacity of us airlines is expected to grow at around in  approximately the same as its growth rate 
united s available seat miles are expected to increase  with growth domestically and growth internationally 
revenue per available seat mile is forecast to be up approximately 
costs per available seat mile excluding esop charges are expected to increase approximately 
for the first quarter  united expects total system revenue per available seat mile to decrease by versus the same period last year  on higher capacity 
costs per available seat mile excluding esop charges are expected to decrease approximately over the first quarter of the company s outlook is consistent with the current first call consensus earnings estimate of per fully distributed share for the first quarter 
the information included in the above outlook section  as well as certain statements made throughout the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are identified by an asterisk  is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
it is not reasonably possible to itemize all of the many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook of an airline operating in the global economy 
some factors that could significantly impact expected capacity  unit revenues  fully distributed unit costs and fully distributed earnings per share include the airline pricing environment  industry capacity decisions  willingness of customers to travel  the success of the company s cost control efforts  fuel cost  costs of safety and security measures  actions of the us  foreign and local governments  the effect of the us excise tax on travel  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the asian economic environment and travel patterns  the economic environment of the airline industry  the general economic environment and other factors discussed herein 
with respect to the forward looking statement set forth in the environmental and legal contingencies section  some of the factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of these contingencies are changes in applicable laws  the development of facts in individual cases  settlement opportunities and the actions of plaintiffs  judges and juries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk united s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and short term investments 
united does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio 
united s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements  depending upon market conditions 
a portion of the borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies which exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the company has placed foreign currency deposits primarily for japanese yen  french francs and german marks to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies
