item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report 
certain statements made herein are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of such statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
in particular  unanticipated changes in the economic  competitive  governmental  technological  marketing and other factors identified herein and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission could affect such results 
general the source of the company s revenues to date includes i remediation services  including both in situ and ex situ bioremediation  ii commercial sales of the company s biological degradation systems  and iii funds received from third parties and government agencies to conduct specific research and development programs 
while the company has realized significant commercial revenues for several years from remediation services  it has only recently seen the first substantial revenues from sales of full scale biological degradation systems for the treatment of contaminated air and water streams 
although great strides have been made in the commercialization of these systems  significant expenditures will be required for continued research and development  additional marketing activities and ultimately the development of manufacturing capabilities for the further commercialization of the company s biodegradation systems 
the amount and timing of such expenditures will vary depending on several factors  including the progress of development and testing  funding from third parties  the level of enforcement of environmental regulations by federal and state agencies  technological advances  changing competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial potential of the company s systems 
the amount and timing of such expenditures cannot be predicted 
on april  the company acquired fmi  a full service environmental consulting and engineering firm that is now operated as the company s fmi operations group 
remediation services are fmi s core business and generate the greatest portion of fmi s revenues 
the majority of fmi s work is eligible for reimbursement to its clients or their lending banks under the wisconsin petroleum environmental cleanup fund act pecfa 
review of the pecfa claims by the wisconsin department of commerce dcom and determination of any ineligible costs typically is not completed until one to three years after the expense has been incurred and paid by fmi s client or its bank 
this exposes the client to the risk that remediation expenses it incurred and paid ultimately may be disallowed for pecfa reimbursement by dcom 
while not contractually obligated to do so  fmi has historically reimbursed its clients or their lending banks for the remediation costs for services provided by fmi which ultimately were determined by dcom to be ineligible for reimbursement under pecfa 
the wisconsin state budget bill  which was passed in october  extended through december the million maximum per site reimbursement under the pecfa program which  under previous legislation  was to be reduced to  for sites entering the program after june  
however  revised administrative policies and procedures recently implemented by dcom in connection with the legislative process have limited  and are expected to continue to limit  the types and costs of services reimbursable by dcom 
dcom has recently limited approval  absent special circumstances  for implementation of remediation activities  instead favoring natural attenuation as the presumed remedy and generally allowing reimbursement primarily for site investigation and monitoring costs 
the implementation of such revised policies has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a decrease in revenues per site generated by fmi 
a more aggressive marketing strategy has been implemented with the goal of bringing a greater number of sites under contract and increasing overall revenue 
as a result of the acquisition of fmi in april  the company s results of operations during and are not directly comparable 
results of operations compared to the company reported revenues in of  an increase of from the net loss applicable to common stock in increased to  while the basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to in the decrease in basic and diluted net loss per share is due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding primarily from issuance of common stock in connection with the fmi acquisition and a related private placement 
commercial revenues increased to  from  in while revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts increased to  from  in the increased commercial revenues are due primarily to the inclusion of sales of the company s fmi operations group  acquired on april  increased commercial remediation revenues more than offset decreased revenues from the company s pollution control business

compared to the company reported revenues in of  an increase of from the net loss applicable to common stock in increased to  while the basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to in the decrease in basic and diluted net loss per share was due to a greater number of shares outstanding resulting from the issuance of common stock in may commercial revenues increased to  from  in while revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts decreased to  from  in the increase in commercial revenues was due primarily to revenues of approximately million from the company s mwr subsidiary that was acquired in february combined with increased systems sales of approximately million by the company s commercial air group related to the abtco biofilter project 
revenues from remediation activities accounted for of the company s commercial revenues during revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts decreased slightly from as revenues from numerous new projects partially offset the loss of revenues due to the conclusion in december of pcb work the company performed for the texas eastern transmission corporation 
the company s phase ii sbir  phase ii department of defense sbir and phase ii national science foundation sbir all contributed significantly to results 
the company also recorded initial revenues in under a new phase i grant from the department of energy  a new phase i grant from the national science foundation and a new phase ii grant from the department of defense

the cost of commercial operations increased to  due to higher revenue levels  a greater proportion of which were attributable to lower margin systems sales 
research and development expenses decreased to  marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to  due largely to the increased amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of mwr in february  increased legal expenses associated with patent applications and the growth of the company offset by a decrease in marketing expenses due primarily to reduced personnel related costs combined with other cost reduction efforts

throughout the company investigated the cause of the failure  redesigned the internal grating and rebuilt and restarted the system at a cost of approximately  while the ultimate responsibility for these expenses has not yet been determined  the company is actively pursuing reimbursement of these expenses from third parties

the timing and amount of such expenditures will fluctuate depending on the timing of field tests  systems development activity  the rapidity with which the company s biodegradation systems can be further commercialized and the availability of capital 
furthermore  future projects may require the company to set aside additional capital to collateralize performance bonds 
revenue from certain of the company s contracts is recognized as services are provided and costs are incurred 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage relationship of costs incurred from contract inception to date to the estimated total costs for each contract 
the asset unbilled revenue represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed
