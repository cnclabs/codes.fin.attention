item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception on september   conceptus has been primarily engaged in the design  development and marketing of minimally invasive devices for reproductive medical applications 
the company s current focus is on improving the safety of resectoscopic procedures  developing products for improved diagnosis of infertility and providing a non surgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization  the most commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide 
the company has a limited history of operations and has experienced significant operating losses since inception 
operating losses are expected to continue for at least the next several years as the company continues to expend substantial resources to fund clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  to conduct research and development  and to expand marketing and sales activities 
the company s initial commercial products  the t tac and starrt falloposcopy systems  have generated limited sales to date 
the company currently sells its products to international markets through a limited number of distributors who resell to physicians and hospitals 
domestically  the company sells its products through a small direct sales force and us distributors 
sales to distributors are made on open credit terms and may include purchase discounts 
in and  the company made adjustments to the profile of its distributors  resulting in replacement and addition of new distributors in domestic and international markets 
in  the company added an additional domestic distributor 
although the company began marketing components of its t tac system in april  general marketing of the system commenced upon the receipt of a k clearance for diagnosis of proximal tubal occlusion in august sales in were through a small direct sales force and two new significant distributors on open credit terms and consisted primarily of commercial shipments of t tac products 
sales in were through a small direct sales force and existing distributors  as well as a new distributor  on open credit terms and consisted of commercial shipments of t tac and futura products 
in the fourth quarter of the company presented results from the imsf study of its starrt falloposcopy system 
study data showed that use of the starrt falloposcopy system altered infertility diagnosis in the majority of cases versus conventional infertility diagnosis 
in february  the company received k clearance of its second generation starrt catheter  the stargate catheter  a component of the company s starrt falloposcopy system  for the diagnosis of pto 
the stargate catheter is a modification of the vs falloposcopy catheter  which was previously cleared for marketing in the united states by the fda 
the stargate catheter is designed to improve visualization of the fallopian tube by reducing the amount light reflected off of tubal surfaces 
on november   the company completed the acquisition of microgyn  a privately held medical device company developing products designed to improve the safety and performance of resectoscope procedures  including therapeutic hysteroscopy 
the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of microgyn  inc in exchange for million in cash on the acquisition date and million in stock paid six months after the acquisition date  plus  due to assumption of certain liabilities and related acquisition expenses 
in may  the company satisfied the million accrued acquisition cost by issuing  shares of common stock 
additional contingent consideration in cash or stock  at the option of conceptus  is payable to the former shareholders of microgyn based upon meeting certain future milestones 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the company is continuing product development of the microgyn product portfolio  clinical and marketing activities and is developing a distribution strategy for both international and domestic customers 
in the second half of the company introduced the era and futura resectoscope sleeve products from the microgyn technology portfolio 
these products allow the use of physiologic solution when performing hysteroscopic procedures  which increases the safety of resection procedures by eliminating the risk of dilutional hyponatremia  a complication that can lead to serious heart  lung  and brain disorders 
the company received k clearance for its futura resectoscope sleeve for urologic applications in the first quarter of in september  the company received k clearance for its era resectoscope sleeve for gynecological procedures 
also in september  the company entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with imagyn  formerly urohealth  inc  granting imagyn an exclusive  worldwide license to distribute products for urologic applications of the resectoscope sleeve 
since december   imagyn has not purchased any of the company s products 
in march  imagyn notified the company of its intent to terminate the distribution agreement between the parties as of june  although the company and imagyn are currently renegotiating the terms of their relationship  there can be no assurance that the parties will reach an agreement on such terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a suitable alternate distributor for its products for urologic applications 
the inability to attract new significant distributors or the loss of one or more of the company s distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company intends to sell the era resectoscope sleeve for gynecologic applications in the united states and internationally through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors in certain markets and regions 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired the exclusive manufacturing rights from medical scientific  inc  the supplier of the company s era and futura resectoscope sleeves 
the manufacturing know how related to the era and futura resectoscope sleeves has been transferred to the company s facility in san carlos  with full production anticipated by the end of the first quarter the acquisition and transfer of these manufacturing rights resulted in additional cost of goods expenditures approximating million 
certain of the company s products are manufactured by original equipment manufacturers while others are manufactured by conceptus at its location in san carlos  california 
if the volume of t tac  starrt  and era and futura products increases significantly  the company expects to increase its direct manufacturing operations in order to better control product costs and increase gross margin 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors  actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the rate at which the company establishes its domestic and international distributor network  the timing and size of distributor purchases  the progress of clinical trials  and the introduction of competitive products for diagnosis and treatment of the female reproductive system 
the company continues to devote significant resources to the product development program for the s top device  a non surgical alternative to surgical tubal ligation  the most commonly used method of sterilization 
the system utilizes a unique micro coil designed to be permanently implanted into the fallopian tube in order to obtain effective sterilization 
peri and pre hysterectomy patients have participated in trials to determine the tissue response to the implanted microcoil 
in july  the company commenced a phase ii efficacy study of the s top system in australia 
the phase ii study involves device placement in fertile women who desire permanent sterilization 
study patients will be monitored for a minimum of two years 
results of operations years ended december   and sales increased to  in from  in this increase was due to increased commercial shipments of the company s t tac products to a significant domestic distributor  as well as commercial shipments of the company s futura products to a new domestic distributor 
sales increased to  in from  in this increase was due to increased commercial shipments of the company s t tac products to a significant domestic distributor and increased sales to international distributors 
sales to domestic customers represented of sales in  of sales in and of sales in cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to approximately million associated with the acquisition of the exclusive manufacturing rights of the company s era and futura products from msi  combined with increased unit shipments of t tac and futura products 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased unit shipments of t tac products 
research and development r d expenses  which include clinical and regulatory expenses  increased to million in from million in net of million of acquired in process research and development and million in the increase of million in and the prior year increases were primarily attributable to the increased number of research and development employees and related use of supplies  prototype materials and inventory  and increased expenses associated with supporting various clinical trials 
as discussed above  the company expensed million of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of microgyn in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the million increase in and the million increase in were primarily due to the growth in marketing expenses associated with promoting the company s products and growth of united states and european sales and marketing personnel  increased administrative costs required to support expanding operations and increased administrative costs of being a public company  net interest and investment income decreased to million in from million in the decrease is a result of lower average cash balances due to the utilization of cash for operations 
net interest and investment income increased to million in from  in the increase in was due to higher average cash balances from proceeds of the initial public offering in february proceeds from these financing activities were invested in high grade short term investments 
interest expense for all periods was insignificant 
as a result of the items discussed above  net loss increased to million in from million in and million in at december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december  the company had research credit carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards described above will expire  if not utilized  at various dates beginning in the years through utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see risk factors limited operating history  anticipated future losses 
accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share statement  which the company adopted in the year ended december  under the new requirements for calculating basic earnings per share  the effect of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options is excluded 
the impact of statement results in no change to the company s net loss per share  as potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the current computation as they are antidilutive 
basic and diluted net loss is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s cash expenditures have significantly exceeded its sales  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million at december  on february   the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of the company s common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
prior to the initial public offering  the company funded its operations since incorporation primarily through the private placement of equity securities  as well as through interest income  equipment financing and secured loan arrangements 
through december   the company had raised approximately million from the private placement of equity securities 
at december   conceptus had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million compared with million at december  the decrease in was due to million used in operations  primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development of the company s products  international clinical trials  the initial marketing of the company s falloposcopy products internationally and in the united states  and general and administrative expenses to support increased operations 
capital expenditures during were million compared with  in this increase was primarily due to the implementation of a new computer system  the acquisition of machinery and equipment necessary to manufacture the era and futura resectoscope sleeves and the leasehold improvements on the company s new facility 
the company plans to finance its capital needs principally from its existing capital resources  and to the extent available  bank and lease financing 
conceptus believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources devoted to developing  manufacturing and marketing the company s products 
the company s capital requirements will also depend on  among other things  the resources required to hire and develop a direct sales force in the united states and internationally  the resources required to expand manufacturing capacity and facilities requirements and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing within this time frame and  therefore  may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s products have generated limited revenue to date 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s existing or future products will gain any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians  patients and healthcare payors  even if reimbursement and necessary international and united states regulatory approvals are obtained 
the company believes that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of the company s products  and there can be no assurance that any such recommendations or endorsements will be obtained 
the company believes that physicians will not use the company s products unless they determine  based on clinical data and other factors  that these systems are an attractive alternative to other means of diagnosing and treating diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system and that the products offer clinical utility in a cost effective manner 
acceptance among physicians will also depend upon the company s ability to train interventional gynecologists and other potential users of the company s products in new interventional techniques and upon the willingness of such persons to learn these new techniques 
failure of the company s products to achieve significant market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon transcervical tubal access and catheterization products 
the company s initial commercial products  the t tac and starrt falloposcopy systems  have generated limited sales to date 
current applications for these systems include accessing  diagnosing and treating diseases and disorders of the fallopian tubes 
expanding the number of applications for these products will require additional development and  in certain cases  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the company would experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations if these products are not successfully commercialized for existing or future applications 
limited operating history  anticipated future losses 
the company has a limited history of operations 
since its inception in september  the company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its t tac  starrt falloposcopy and s top systems and  since  the era and futura product lines 
the company has generated only limited revenues and has only limited experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling its products in commercial quantities 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects its operating losses to continue for at least the next several years as it continues to expend substantial resources in funding clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  expansion of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities and research and product development or acquisition 
due to the expense and unpredictable nature of these activities  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
whether the company can successfully manage the transition to a large scale commercial enterprise will depend upon a number of factors  including obtaining selected regulatory and reimbursements approvals for its existing or potential products  establishing its commercial manufacturing capability  developing its us marketing and selling capabilities and establishing an international network 
failure to make such a transition successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on patents and protection of proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend substantially on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of its technology 
there can be no assurance that the company s five issued patents  any future patents that may be issued as a result of the company s united states or foreign patent applications  or the patents under which the company has license rights  will offer any degree of protection to the company s products against competitive products 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued or licensed to the company or any of the company s patent applications will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitors  many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the united states or in international markets 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  uspto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect the company s trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or interference proceedings involving the company will result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of effort by the company s technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which the company may become a party could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the company to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to the company on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a patent issued to target  and subject to target s license to the company  which contains claims relating to the design of the company s variable softness micro catheters the target patent  has been the subject of four reexamination proceedings in the uspto 
following the completion of the first of such proceedings  the uspto issued a reexamination certificate and confirmed the patentability 
after the uspto s review of petitions for second  third and fourth reexaminations  target received notice from the uspto that it had reaffirmed the patentability of the claims of the target patent 
in addition  in november  target filed a lawsuit in united states district court against scimed life systems  inc scimed  a subsidiary of bsc  and cordis endovascular systems  inc cordis  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc  alleging infringement of a target patent relating to variable stiffness in microcatheters  and seeking damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against sales of such companies products believed to be infringing the target patent 
the defendants responded by challenging the validity of the target patent  denying infringement and raising other defenses 
in may  the district court granted target s motion for an injunction prohibiting the defendants from continuing to sell the products alleged to infringe the patent 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed the injunction pending an appeal by the defendants 
upon the recent merger between bsc and target  the lawsuit has been dismissed as to scimed 
subsequently  the court of appeals vacated the preliminary injunction 
the lawsuit was dismissed as to cordis pursuant to a settlement agreement signed january  any invalidation of the target patent could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
legislation is pending in congress that  if enacted in its present form  would limit the ability of medical device manufacturers in the future to obtain patents on surgical and medical procedures that are not performed by  or as a part of  devices or compositions that are themselves patentable 
while the company cannot predict whether the legislation will be enacted  or precisely what limitations will result from the law if enacted  any limitation or reduction in the patentability of medical and surgical methods and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to protect its proprietary methods and procedures 
in addition to patents  the company relies on trade secrets and technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
the company typically requires its employees  consultants and advisors to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with the company 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by the company during the course of the individual s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties  except in specific circumstances 
the agreements also generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to the company shall be the exclusive property of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will not be breached or that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology  or that conceptus can meaningfully protect its rights in unpatented proprietary technology 
government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including the medical devices used in the company s t tac and starrt falloposcopy systems and era and futura resectoscope sleeves  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities  both in the united states and internationally 
in the united states  the principal regulatory authorities are the food and drug administration fda and corresponding state agencies  such as the california department of health services cdhs 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the fda requires companies that wish to market a new medical device or an existing medical device for use for a new indication to obtain either a premarket notification clearance under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act k or a premarket approval pma prior to the introduction of such product into the market 
in addition  material changes to medical devices are also subject to fda review and clearance or approval 
if a medical device manufacturer or distributor can establish  among other things  that a device is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to certain legally marketed devices  for which the fda has not required a pma  the manufacturer or distributor may seek clearance from the fda to market the device by filing a k 
though generally believed to be a shorter  less costly regulatory path than a pma  the k may need to be supported by appropriate data establishing to the satisfaction of the fda the claim of substantial equivalence to the predicate device 
in addition  the fda may require review by an advisory panel as a condition for k clearances  which can further lengthen the regulatory process 
the pma approval process can take several years from initial filing and requires the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information 
no assurance can be given that any future products or applications developed by the company will not require approval under the more lengthy and expensive pma process 
if the company is required to obtain approval for any products pursuant to the pma procedure or  if the k process with respect to any products is extended for a considerable length of time  the commencement of commercial sales of the company s products will be delayed substantially 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary k clearances or pma or other approvals to market its products for the intended uses on a timely basis  if at all  and delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  regulatory clearances  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance  and requirements for licensing may differ significantly from fda requirements 
the european union has promulgated rules that require manufacturers of medical products to obtain by mid the right to affix to their products the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european union medical device directives 
the iso series of standards for quality operations has been developed to ensure that companies know the standards of quality to which they must adhere to receive european union certification 
iso certification is one of the ce mark certification requirements 
failure to receive the right to affix to a company product the ce mark will prohibit the company from selling such product in member countries of the european union after mid the company received iso certification in january many countries in which the company currently operates or intends to operate either do not currently regulate medical devices or have minimal registration requirements  however  these countries may develop more extensive regulations in the future which could adversely affect the company s ability to market its products 
in addition  significant costs and requests by regulators for additional information may be encountered by the company in its efforts to obtain regulatory approvals 
any such events could substantially delay or preclude the company from marketing its products in the united states or internationally 
regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the company s products may be marketed 
in addition  in order for companies to obtain such approvals  the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous additional requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the promotion of approved medical devices for uses other than those specifically cleared for marketing by the fda 
the company will be required to adhere to applicable fda regulations regarding good manufacturing practices gmp and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements will be monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda and the cdhs  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new government regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  such changes might have on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  emerging market 
the company has only limited experience marketing and selling its products in commercial quantities 
establishing marketing and sales capability sufficient to support sales in commercial quantities will require significant resources  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain qualified marketing personnel  direct sales personnel or contract sales representatives or that future sales efforts of the company will be successful 
the company currently sells its products to international markets through a limited number of distributors who resell to physicians and hospitals 
domestically  the company sells its products through a small direct sales force and us distributors 
sales to distributors are made on open credit terms and may include purchase discounts 
in  sales to two of the company s distributors accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales 
one of these distributors  imagyn  has notified the company of its intention to terminate the distribution agreement between the parties as of june  although the company and imagyn are currently renegotiating the terms of their relationship  there can be no assurance that the parties will reach an agreement on such terms 
the loss of either of these two distributors or the inability to attract new significant distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  interventional gynecology is an emerging medical market with widely varying practice patterns 
therefore  there is no proven distribution channel for marketing the company s products in the united states or internationally 
while the company is committed to establishing an effective distribution channel for its products  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the failure to establish and maintain an effective worldwide distribution channel for the company s products  or to retain qualified sales personnel to support commercial sales of the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon international distributors and sales 
the company currently has a limited network of international distributors  which market the company s products to certain european  african  asian and australian countries 
the company s international sales are dependent upon the marketing efforts of  and sales by  these distributors 
the company relies on these distributors to assist it in obtaining product registration and reimbursement approvals in certain international markets 
the company s strategy is to operate internationally through distributors with an established franchise in the field of gynecology 
if a distributor were to fail to invest adequate capital promoting the company s products and training physicians in the proper techniques for utilizing the company s products  or were to cease operations  the company would likely be unable to achieve significant sales in the subject territory 
furthermore  conceptus does not currently have distributors in a number of international markets that it has targeted and will need to establish additional international distribution relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will engage qualified distributors in these markets in a timely manner  if at all 
the failure to engage such distributors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of risks are inherent in international operations and transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by the imposition of government controls  changes in regulatory requirements or interpretations thereof  export license requirements  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  and difficulties in staffing  coordinating and managing international operations 
additionally  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in international currency exchange rates as well as constraints on the company s ability to maintain or increase prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to commercialize successfully its current or future products in any international market 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost associated with the treatment of patients 
although reimbursement for catheterization and hysteroscopy procedures has generally been available in the united states  there can be no assurance that such reimbursement will continue to be available 
the company does not expect that third party reimbursement will be available for its products unless and until fda clearance or approval is received 
there can be no assurance  even if the company s products are cleared by the fda for new clinical applications  that full reimbursement will be available for such procedures 
if fda clearance or approval is received  third party reimbursement for these products will be dependent upon decisions by individual health maintenance organizations  private insurers and other payors 
to date  the company has received fda clearance and approval on its products in connection with its t tac and starrt falloposcopy systems  and the company believes third party reimbursement will be available in the united states under existing procedure codes for diagnosis and re establishment of patency of the fallopian tubes and  if applicable  for related interpretation of such procedures 
in addition  the company has received fda clearance and approval on its era and futura resectoscope sleeves and believes third party reimbursement will be available under existing procedures codes for hysteroscopy and turp 
however  there can be no assurance that such procedure codes will remain available or that the reimbursement under these codes will be adequate 
given the efforts to control and decrease health care costs in recent years  there can be no assurance that any reimbursement will be sufficient to permit the company to achieve or maintain profitability 
the company could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent that any such changes affect reimbursement for therapeutic or diagnostic catheterization procedures or hysteroscopy procedures in which the company s products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which the company s products are used  or adverse changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance of the company s products in international markets may be dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored and private healthcare insurance 
obtaining reimbursement approvals can require to months or longer 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain reimbursement in any country within a particular time  for a particular amount  or at all 
failure to obtain such approvals could have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the company s products in the international markets in which the company is seeking approvals and could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales  business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition  uncertainty of technological change 
the medical device industry is highly competitive 
the company expects competition for devices to diagnose and treat female reproductive disorders to increase 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than the company and have greater resources and expertise in research and development  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
certain of these companies are developing and marketing devices for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and others may choose to enter this market at a later date 
additionally  certain smaller companies are developing alternative catheter based systems for the diagnosis and treatment of female reproductive disorders that may compete directly with the company s systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than those developed by the company or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against such competitors based on its abilities to manufacture  market and sell its products 
as the company commercializes its s top system  it expects to compete against other surgical procedures for permanent contraception  mechanical devices and other contraceptive methods 
the company also competes with other companies for clinical sites to conduct trials 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the length of time required for product development and regulatory approval plays an important role in a company s competitive position 
consequently  the company s success will depend in part on its ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and commercialization of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successfully products 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so and that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing its products in commercial quantities 
the company currently manufactures the t tac and starrt products in small quantities for commercial sales 
the company will begin commercial production of the era and futura product lines during the first quarter of manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter manufacturing difficulties  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon sole source suppliers  lack of contractual arrangements 
conceptus purchases both raw materials used in its products and finished goods from various suppliers and relies on single sources for most of these items 
the company does not have formal supply contracts with several key vendors and  accordingly  no assurance can be made that such firms will continue to supply the company with such raw materials or finished goods in sufficient quantities  or at all 
delays associated with any future raw materials or finished goods shortages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly as the company scales up its manufacturing activities in support of international commercial sales and  to the extent that fda approvals are received  united states commercial sales 
possible future capital requirements 
conceptus believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources devoted to developing  manufacturing and marketing the company s products 
the company s capital requirements will also depend on  among other things  the resources required to hire  develop and maintain a direct sales force in the united states and internationally  the resources required to expand manufacturing capacity and facilities requirements and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing within this time frame and  therefore  may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability risk and recalls  limited insurance coverage 
the manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid significant product liability claims and potential related adverse publicity 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance with coverage limits of  per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of  which the company believes is comparable to that maintained by other companies of similar size serving similar markets 
however  there can be no assurance that product liability claims in connection with clinical trials or sale of the company s products will not exceed such insurance coverage limits  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company may require increased product liability coverage as its products are commercialized 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage  or a recall of the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a number of key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
the company faces intense competition for qualified personnel  many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
furthermore  the company relies on the services of several medical and scientific consultants  all of whom are employed on a full time basis by hospitals or academic or research institutions 
such consultants are therefore not available to devote their full time or attention to the company s affairs 
influence of boston scientific corporation 
as of february   bsc beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  bsc may be able to exercise influence over the business and financial affairs of the company 
in april  bsc completed the acquisition of target  by merging target with a wholly owned subsidiary 
certain of the company s products are based upon patents and other intellectual property licensed from target  on an exclusive basis within the field of reproductive physiology 
in the event that such target patents are at any time invalidated  the company s proprietary position in the marketplace would be severely compromised and the company s competitors could have the ability to incorporate the target technology in their products 
in addition  should the target technology licensed to the company be found to infringe upon a third party s technology  the company s sale of products based on such infringing target technology could be limited 
finally  in the event that the company materially breaches the terms of its license from target  target will have the right to terminate the license 
any such termination of this license would deprive the company of the right to develop or sell products based on the licensed technology  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
influence by directors  executive officers and principal stockholders 
as of february   the company s directors  executive officers and principal stockholders  including bsc  beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the company  including any determination with respect to the acquisition or disposition of assets by the company  future issuances of common stock or other securities by the company  declaration of dividends on the common stock and the election of directors 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
potential fluctuations in future quarterly results 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors  actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  progress of clinical trials and introduction of competitive products 
volatility of stock price 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the company s stock price has in the past been  and may in the future be  subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings variations from estimates until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant stock price volatility 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly held medical device companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  fda and international regulatory actions  changes in reimbursement levels  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company or others  changes in healthcare policy in the united states and internationally  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding the company  its competitors or the medical device industry generally  and changes in general market conditions may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
effect of certain charter and bylaw provisions 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
certain of these provisions allow the company to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors 
in addition  the company has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the stockholder rights plan  and the charter and bylaw provisions described above  may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
absence of dividends 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company intends to retain any future earnings for reinvestment in its business 
any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent upon the company s financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
year compliance 
the year issue arises because most computer systems and programs were designed to handle only a two digit year  not a four digit year 
these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
the company has been informed by its information system vendors that such systems are able to process the year accurately and accordingly does not anticipate any year issues from its own information systems  databases or programs 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is in the process of developing a plan to determine the impact that third parties which are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
there can be no assurance that such plan will be able to address fully  or at all  the impact of the year issue on the company  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
