until december   the company had one additional project the milesburg project which had been in the development stage since and involved in significant contract litigation since the inception of its development activities 
on august   the company entered into a buy out agreement with the utility which had contracted to purchase electricity from the milesburg project which was finalized on december  under the terms of the buy out agreement  the company sold substantially all of the assets of the milesburg project to this utility and terminated the ongoing litigation 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compares the company s results of operations for the years ending december   and and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
cautionary statement this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of  in order to provide investors with prospective information about the company 
for this purpose  any statements which are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december net income in amounted to  or cents per share as compared to net income of  or cents per share in the overall increase in net income during is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of the milesburg project  the reversal of the provision for non recovery of milesburg project development costs  and a reduction in general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of both the company s efforts to reduce its corporate overhead expenses and the capitalization of labor and overhead expenses related to the milesburg project 
the company s overall increase in net income during was offset in part by an operating loss from the scrubgrass project primarily as a result of the generator repair discussed under item business scrubgrass which reduced the company s power generation revenues and affected certain of the company s expenses 
in comparing the company s net income for to  it is important to point out that the company s results of operations during were beneficially effected by certain non recurring revenues which included the recognition of certain revenues of  which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  the settlement of a warranty issue related to the scrubgrass project for  and the settlement of a legal proceeding for approximately  net of legal fees 
in light of the company s favorable earnings and available cash  the company declared dividends on its common stock in of  or cents per share as compared to dividends in of  or cents per share 
power generation revenues in amounted to  as compared to  in and all pertained to the scrubgrass project 
the overall decrease in power generation revenues during is largely attributable to the extended maintenance outage to repair the scrubgrass generator and a reduction of power generation revenues recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of certain revenues under the power purchase agreement  in as compared to  in 
in addition  the power generation revenues were higher by comparison to because the company recognized certain revenues of  during which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement 
with reference to the impact of the extended maintenance outage  the scrubgrass plant was inoperative for approximately days during the first quarter of to consider generator matters 
during the second quarter of  the scrubgrass annual outage also extended approximately days longer than the day outage in may due primarily to the generator repair 
at an average of  of revenues per day  the additional outage days in account for an approximate reduction in power generation revenues for the year ended year ended december  of million by comparison to the same period in however  the impact of the lost revenues from the scrubgrass outage was mitigated by a increase in certain rates charged to the utility under the terms of the power purchase agreement and improvements in the performance of the scrubgrass plant after the extended outage 
specifically  the scrubgrass plant operated at a average capacity for the six months ended december  versus for the six months ended december  operating expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall decrease is primarily attributable to lower fuel costs and operator bonuses because the overall capacity rate in was lower by comparison to as a result of the extended maintenance outage to repair the generator 
however  the decrease was offset in part by higher maintenance costs to complete the extended maintenance outage at the scrubgrass plant  an increase in contracted rates for certain fuel costs and higher personnel costs incurred under the o m 
lease expense in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall decrease in lease expense during is primarily due to a decrease in the lease expense recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of lease expenses  in as compared to  in and the lowering of average interest rates which occurred in and which reduced the lessor s loan costs that were passed through to the company in its facility lease expenses 
the decrease was offset in part by an increase in the principal payments under the scrubgrass project term loan which increased the lessor s loan costs that were passed through to the company in its facility lease expenses 
general and administrative expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to the company s efforts to reduce its corporate overhead expenses and the capitalization of labor and overhead expenses aggregating to  for development efforts related to the milesburg project 
the company s major steps to reduce its corporate overhead included a consolidation of its vermont and new hampshire offices into one office in new hampshire completed by may  a reduction in its executive officer compensation  a reduction in its employee headcount by an equivalent of two full time employees  and a reduction of its insurance costs by restructuring insurance programs 
in addition  the company has realized reductions in management costs for the scrubgrass project due to additional experience of the manager s employees and because the negotiation of certain contractual matters required less effort in the company continues to incur substantial management and professional fees to defend its position in certain legal matters 
accordingly  the full effect of the company s efforts to reduce its corporate overhead expenses still has not yet been shown in its recent operating results 
reversal of provision for nonrecovery of project development costs relates to the company s milesburg project and amounted to  in as discussed under item business milesburg  the company sold the milesburg project to west penn pursuant to a buy out agreement dated august  in light of this buy out agreement  which established a value significantly in excess of the company s recorded carrying value for its investment in the milesburg project  the company removed its reserve for the impairment in value of this investment during the third quarter of the reserve was established in by a charge against earnings due to the uncertainties surrounding whether the company would realize value from its investment in this project 
other income amounted to  in and consisted of revenue recorded as a result of the release of certain milesburg obligations which were payable only upon the occurrence of events related to project development 
other income in consisted primarily of proceeds from a legal settlement of  and sunnyside project sales tax refunds of approximately  arising out of activities prior to the date of sale 
other income in was offset in part by a provision made for the continued decline in value of the company s preferred stock investment in hamilton technologies  inc  a privately held massachusetts developer of computer aided software engineering case software 
interest income in amounted to  as compared to interest income of  in the increase in interest income is primarily attributable to interest of  received from west penn because the proceeds of million committed pursuant to the buy out agreement dated august  were not received until december  excluding the aforementioned interest received from west penn  the company s interest income decreased in primarily due to lower investments in cash and cash equivalents  lower investments in restricted cash and less interest recognized on the company s notes receivable related to the sale of its interest in the sunnyside project 
beginning in april  the company has deferred the interest income on the notes receivable related to the sale of its interest in the sunnyside project until the litigation with the purchasers is resolved see part i item legal proceedings 
while the company believes its position in this litigation is meritorious  the company also believes it may take an extended period of time to enforce its rights and collect on these notes receivable 
now that the sunnyside notes receivable have been in arrears for more than one year and are expected to remain in arrears for the foreseeable future  the company believes it is in the best interest of its investors to classify these notes receivable  along with the related contingent liabilities  as long term and defer future interest income so that the company s financial position and ongoing results of operations are presented more conservatively 
interest expense in amounted to  as compared to interest expense of  in the increase in is primarily attributable to additional long term debt for the scrubgrass project amounting to  a discussion of this additional long term debt is included under the caption liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
gain on sale of project amounted to  in and pertains to a gain recognized as a result of the company s sale of the milesburg project 
the sale of the milesburg project and the calculation of the gain is discussed further under the caption item business milesburg 
warranty income in amounted to  and resulted from a settlement with an engineering and construction contractor for the scrubgrass plant which was received in march there was no warranty income in income tax expense in amounted to  or of income before income taxes  as compared to an income tax expense of  or of income before income taxes  in the increase in income tax expense resulted primarily from higher earnings during the effective tax rate was higher by comparison to the rate primarily as a result of the additional charges to deferred state tax expense and because the taxability of temporary differences reversing in occurred in states with higher tax rates 
the overall decrease in the effective tax rate was offset in part by a difference between the gain for financial reporting purposes and the gain for tax reporting purposes on the sale of the milesburg project which contributed to a higher effective tax rate in a significant portion of the company s income tax expense during and resulted in a decrease in the company s deferred tax asset rather than in cash outlays 
see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  net income in amounted to  or cents per share as compared to a net loss of  or cents per share in the overall increase is primarily attributable to favorable operating performance of the scrubgrass project  the recognition of certain revenues of  which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  the settlement of a warranty issue related to the scrubgrass project for  and the settlement of a legal proceeding for approximately  net of legal fees 
in light of the company s favorable earnings in  the company paid dividends in of  or cents per share as compared to dividends paid in of  or cents per share 
power generation revenues in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase in power generation revenues during is primarily attributable to the recognition of certain revenues of  which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement and an increase in the power generation and contracted rates billed to the utility 
the increase in power generation occurred primarily because the plant operated at of its capacity in as compared to of its capacity in the overall increase in power generation revenues was offset in part by a reduction in the revenue recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of certain revenues under the power purchase agreement which amounted to  in as compared to  in all power generation revenues earned by the company in and related to the scrubgrass project 
operating expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase is primarily due to higher fuel costs and operator fees because of the higher capacity rate in and the recognition of maintenance expenses associated with the anticipated repair of the scrubgrass generator 
during  due to maintenance modifications and additional operating experience  fuel costs were only of power generation revenues  as compared to of power generation revenues in moreover  the operating expenses incurred during the annual plant outage were significantly greater by comparison to those incurred during the annual plant outage 
for both of these reasons  the increase in operating expenses was not as significant as the increase in power generation revenues 
lease expense in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase in lease expense during is primarily due to an increase in equity rents paid to the lessor based on the favorable performance of the scrubgrass plant in the increase is partially offset by a decrease in the lease expense recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of lease expenses  in as compared to  in and the lowering of interest rates which occurred in and which reduced the lessor s loan costs that were passed through to the company in its facility lease expenses 
general and administrative expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to the company s efforts to reduce its corporate overhead expenses 
the company s major steps to reduce its corporate overhead in included a consolidation of its vermont and new hampshire offices into one office in new hampshire  a reduction in its executive officer compensation and a reduction in its employee headcount by an equivalent of two full time employees 
however  during  the company continued to incur substantial management and professional fees to negotiate certain contractual matters and defend its position in certain legal matters 
accordingly  the full effect of the company s efforts to reduce corporate overhead expenses has not yet been shown in its operating results 
warranty income in amounted to  and resulted from a settlement with an engineering and construction contractor for the scrubgrass plant which was received in march there was no warranty income in other income in consisted primarily of proceeds from a legal settlement of  and sunnyside project sales tax refunds of approximately  arising out of activities prior to the date of sale 
other income in consisted primarily of sunnyside project sales tax refunds of million arising out of activities prior to the date of sale and fee income related to the scrubgrass project 
the other income in and were both offset in part by the provisions made for the continued decline in value of the company s preferred stock investment in hamilton technologies  inc  a privately held massachusetts developer of computer aided software engineering case software 
income tax expense in amounted to  as compared to an income tax benefit of  in the income tax expense resulted primarily from the company s favorable earnings during furthermore  in  the company s deferred state income tax expense includes a charge related to state net operating loss carryforwards which have expired and a charge related to a valuation allowance which was established because the company estimates that it may not realize all of the recorded tax benefits of its state net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s effective tax rate on its earnings amounted to as compared to an effective tax benefit rate of on its net loss in the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily as a result of the additional charges to deferred state tax expense and because the taxability of temporary differences reversing in occurred in states with higher tax rates 
outlook with a view towards  the company expects to achieve continuing earnings as a result of profits from scrubgrass project operations and management of corporate general and administrative expenses 
the company offers the following prospective information concerning significant components of its consolidated statement of operations which are being compared to historical results of operations in power generation revenues power generation revenues are expected to increase in as a result of a increase in certain contracted rates under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  improvements in the performance of the scrubgrass facility and the absence of an extended maintenance outage in operating expenses operating expenses are expected to increase in as a result of a increase in certain contracted rates under fuel supply agreements  a increase in certain contracted rates under the o m and anticipated increases in personnel costs at the scrubgrass plant 
in addition  because the company does not expect another extended maintenance outage in  operating expenses are expected to further increase as a result of additional fuel consumption and higher operator bonuses which are primarily based on scrubgrass operating profits 
however  absent an extended outage in  the company would expect to incur lower maintenance expenses in the company also expects that certain improvements made in to its fuel handling systems may offset a portion of the increases in fuel costs in lease expenses lease expenses are expected to increase as a result of higher principal payments on the lessor s term loans which will increase the lessor s loan costs that are expected to be passed through to the company in its facility lease expenses 
in addition  the company expects to incur scheduled increases in equity rents for the scrubgrass project in however  largely due to required repayments of million on the company s million credit facility  the company expects that there would be less cash available from the scrubgrass project during as such  the scheduled increases in equity rent are expected to be offset by a reduction in the additional rent paid to the lessor which amounts to percent of the net cash flows from the scrubgrass project see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources outlook 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are expected to reflect a modest increase in because certain labor and overhead expenses  which were capitalized in as a result of development activities for the milesburg project  will be redirected to operating activities during other revenue in  the company enjoyed the benefit of certain non recurring revenues which included the gain on the sale of the milesburg project  the reversal of the provision for non recovery of milesburg project development costs  interest earnings from proceeds on the sale of the milesburg project and revenue recorded as a result of the release of certain milesburg obligations which were payable only upon the occurrence of events related to project development 
the company does not expect these items to recur in recently issued accounting standards see note b to the consolidated financial statements for recently issued accounting standards which are required to be adopted in liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash used in operating activities amounted to  in as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in during and  the company s only sources of cash from operating activities were operating profits from the scrubgrass project and investment earnings 
during  primarily because of the financial impact of the generator repair at the scrubgrass project which is discussed further under part i item business scrubgrass  the company incurred a net reduction of cash from its operating activities 
the company offers the following information to discuss the changes in operating assets and liabilities which most notably impacted its cash position during the year ended december  receivable from utility the company s receivable from utility relates to the scrubgrass project and amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the increase in receivable from utility as of december  is primarily due to revenues during november and december which were higher by comparison to those during november and december as a result of higher contracted rates under the power purchase agreement and improvements in the performance of the scrubgrass facility 
additionally  revenues during november were lower by comparison to november because of a short maintenance outage which lasted approximately days 
deferred income tax asset the company s deferred income tax asset amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decrease is largely attributable to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of the tax benefits associated with the provision for nonrecovery of project development costs  which were both recorded during other assets the company s other assets amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the company s other assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs and long term deposits in connection with fuel reserves for the scrubgrass project 
the increase in other assets during primarily pertains to additional financing costs which were incurred in connection with restructuring certain debt related to the scrubgrass project 
accounts payable and accrued expenses the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  due to higher taxable earnings in  the increase during is largely attributable to income tax accruals which were greater as of december  by comparison to december  the company believes the overall increase during was offset in part by reduced spending in which resulted in lower accounts payable balances as of december  deferred gain  net the company s deferred gain  net amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decline is due to the amortization of the deferred gain related to the scrubgrass project  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
receivable from sale of affiliate and deferred interest revenue the company s receivable from sale of affiliate amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the increase is attributable to interest payable by the purchasers of the sunnyside project during the company s deferred interest revenue amounted to  as of december  as compared to as of december  the increase is attributable to interest payable by the purchasers of the sunnyside project during  but deferred for financial reporting purposes 
beginning in april  the company has deferred the interest income on the notes receivable related to the sale of its interest in the sunnyside project until the litigation with the purchasers is resolved see further discussion under results of operations and part i item legal proceedings 
maintenance reserve the company records the expense of major equipment overhauls related to the scrubgrass project to a maintenance reserve on a straight line basis using management s best estimate of when the company will incur future cash outlays for the major equipment overhauls 
when the company incurs cash outlays for major equipment overhauls  they reduce maintenance reserves and are funded substantially from scheduled deposits to a restricted major maintenance fund which have been set aside to ensure that the funds are available for these maintenance procedures see further discussion under the caption investing activities restricted cash 
the maintenance reserve increased to  as of december  from  as of december  primarily due to scheduled reserves provided for the ongoing maintenance of the plant 
investing activities the company received  from investing activities during  used  in investing activities during and received  from investing activities during the company s investing activities are concentrated primarily in the following areas notes receivable the company presently has notes receivable related to the sale of the sunnyside project and related to fees earned in for the scrubgrass project 
the company collected  and  from notes receivable related to the scrubgrass project in and  respectively 
during  the company collected  from notes receivable related to the sale of the sunnyside project 
the notes receivable related to the sunnyside project  with a principal balance of  and accrued interest balance of  as of december   are the subject of a legal proceeding 
see certain factors that may impact future results  item legal proceedings and note n to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information 
restricted cash the company is presently required to make scheduled deposits to a restricted major maintenance fund relating to the scrubgrass project to ensure that funds are available in the future for scheduled major equipment overhauls 
the company is also allowed to spend restricted cash to fund the cost of major equipment overhauls subject to certain restrictions 
during the year ended december   the company s payments for major equipment overhauls exceeded its deposits to the restricted major maintenance fund and interest thereon by  whereas  for the year ended december   the company s deposits to the restricted major maintenance fund and interest thereon exceeded its payments for major equipment overhauls by  the net decrease to the restricted cash fund during occurred primarily as a result of expenditures for major overhauls incurred during the scrubgrass outage 
the restricted cash fund was established at the time of the refinancing of the scrubgrass project in december as such  there were no deposits or withdrawals from restricted cash during proceeds from sale of project on december   the company received  for the sale of the milesburg project 
the company s sale of the milesburg project is discussed further under the caption item business milesburg 
the company also received  from the sale of its interest in the sunnyside project on january  the company s sale of its interest in the sunnyside project is discussed further under the caption item business sunnyside 
property  plant and equipment the company invested   and  in property  plant and equipment expenditures during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expenditures primarily relate to development activities for the company s milesburg project for which development efforts were accelerated during the latter part of during  the company s property plant and equipment expenditures also included certain improvements to the scrubgrass facility which amounted to financing activities the company utilized   and  in financing activities during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s financing activities are concentrated primarily in the following areas dividends the company declared and paid its first dividend of cents per share in december which amounted to  prior to that date  the company s policy had been to retain earnings  if any  for use in its business 
beginning during  the company initiated a quarterly dividend program which is subject to review and consideration by the board of directors each quarter 
in respect of this dividend program  the company declared quarterly dividends of cents per share during each of the quarters in the years ended december  and in addition  the company also declared a special year end dividend of cents per share in out of operating profits and a special dividend of cents per share in out of the proceeds from the milesburg buy out which resulted in aggregate dividends of  or cents per share in and  or cents per share in as of december   the company had dividends payable of  or cents per share which were declared on december  and paid on january  during  the company also paid dividends to its subsidiary s preferred stockholder in the amount of  the preferred stockholder  entitled to cumulative dividends of  per year since december  was paid its dividends up to date during the second quarter of working capital loan the company may borrow up to million under a lessee working capital loan agreement with the lessor for ongoing working capital requirements of the scrubgrass project 
during  the company reduced its outstanding borrowings under the lessee working capital loan agreement from  as of december  to  as of december  the company believes it was in a position to reduce it outstanding borrowings under the lessee working capital loan agreement primarily as a result of better financial management which reduced certain spending levels 
the financial impact of the scrubgrass extended outage did not prevent the company from reducing its borrowings under the lessee working capital loan agreement because the company was able to finance the impact of this extended outage with the million term credit facility described below  available restricted cash balances and extended terms for the generator repair from the generator manufacturer 
term credit facility in june  the lessor entered into a three year credit facility with the lenders of the scrubgrass project to make additional funds available to the scrubgrass project to cover the cash deficiency which resulted from the extended annual outage of the scrubgrass project and associated costs and expenses 
the maximum allowable borrowings under this credit facility are  through july  beginning on july   the maximum allowable borrowings under this credit facility will reduce in  increments every six months through july  when the credit facility will be payable in full 
as of december   the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  which were advanced to the company by the lessor  amounted to  notes payable in addition to the term credit facility described previously  the company has other long term obligations related to its sunnyside project and scrubgrass project in the amounts of  and  respectively as december  the sunnyside project long term obligations are payable based on a schedule which relates directly to the amount of proceeds received from the collection of the outstanding notes receivable from the sale of the company s interest in the sunnyside project 
the next installment for the scrubgrass project long term obligation amounts to  and is payable during the company had short term installment obligations related to its sunnyside project and milesburg project which were fully satisfied during  for which aggregate payments of  and  were made during and  respectively 
until august   the company had long term obligations related to the milesburg project aggregating to  as a result of a settlement agreement dated august   the milesburg project obligations were reduced to  in addition  because certain milesburg obligations were payable only upon the occurrence of events related to project development  milesburg project obligations of  and accrued interest of  were released from liabilities during and reported as other income of  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the remainder of the milesburg project obligations  which amounted to  were paid during on january   the company paid  in final settlement of a note obligation pertaining to its preferred stock 
common stock the company received proceeds from the issuance of its common stock aggregating   and  during  and  respectively 
the common stock was issued solely pursuant to exercises of stock options 
treasury stock the company from time to time makes purchases of its own common stock 
the company did not purchase any treasury stock during during  the company purchased  shares of common stock from a resigning executive officer for  representing all of the officer s holdings in the company 
the company s note receivable from the officer in the amount of  was collected by reducing the proceeds paid to the officer for the common stock 
during  the company made open market purchases of its common stock for  outlook during  the company expects that its principal sources of cash to fund its business activities will be from available cash balances  investment earnings and cash which may become available from the scrubgrass project 
as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  the company is not able to receive cash from the scrubgrass project until all operating expenses  base lease payments which include the lessor s debt service  certain maintenance reserve payments and other subordinated payments of the scrubgrass project are first satisfied 
as discussed under the caption results of operations outlook  the company expects that the scrubgrass project will be profitable in and will generate cash flows from its operating activities 
however  the company anticipates that a significant portion of the expected cash flows in will be utilized for debt and maintenance reserve repayments 
according to the terms of certain scrubgrass project obligations  the company will be required to pay down the million term credit facility to  by july  and to  by january  and make an installment payment in of  under the million scrubgrass project note 
furthermore  pursuant to the provisions of certain scrubgrass project agreements  the company will be required to make additional scheduled deposits of  to replenish restricted cash balances which were used to finance certain maintenance expenses 
however  as discussed under item business scrubgrass  buzzard is required to pay the lessor  in addition to a specified base rent  an additional rent of percent of the net cash flows buzzard receives from the scrubgrass project 
therefore  the company would expect to realize a savings in its additional rent expense to the extent of percent of any required debt and maintenance reserve repayments 
as such  the company expects that the cash flows which may become available in from the scrubgrass project would only be reduced by percent of any required debt and maintenance reserve repayments 
the company continues to address the issue of year compliance 
during the year ended december   the company replaced all of the software at its corporate office with software which is year compliant 
the company has reviewed all of the software at the scrubgrass facility for year compliance and is in the process of either upgrading or replacing this software in accordance with a schedule which would ensure year compliance prior to the year the company does not expect that any future expenditures for software upgrades or replacements at the scrubgrass facility related to year compliance would have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company continues to consider whether there are issues with year compliance at its customer  or any of its vendors  which could adversely affect its operations 
presently  the company s management is unable to assess whether there would be any impact on its operations if its customer  or any of its vendors  fail to ensure that their computer systems are year compliant 
the company is optimistic about the future performance of the scrubgrass project which is expected to achieve consistent earnings for the foreseeable future 
notwithstanding  the scrubgrass project will obviously bear the burden of repaying the debt obligations relating to the extended outage of the scrubgrass project in the near term 
nevertheless  the company believes that the cash flows which may become available from the scrubgrass project  together with cash reserves which the company estimates were approximately million at december   would be sufficient to fund the company s business activities on a long term basis 
however  the payment of any future dividends will depend on the board of directors evaluation  made on a quarterly basis  based on the company s then current and projected operating performance and capital requirements 
see certain factors that may affect future results below 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
ownership of single operating asset the company owns a year leasehold interest in the scrubgrass project  an approximate mw net waste coal fired electric generating facility located in pennsylvania  the lease for which commenced on june  presently  all the company s operating revenues are attributable to power generation from the scrubgrass project 
accordingly  the company s operations are largely dependent upon the successful and continued operation of the scrubgrass project 
in particular  if the scrubgrass project experiences unscheduled shutdowns of significant duration  the company s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon key employees the success of the company is largely dependent upon a staff of four full time employees and one part time employee  including three executive officers 
the loss of any of these employees could adversely effect the company s operations 
third party project management the company has entered into a management services agreement with us gen to manage the scrubgrass project and a year operations and maintenance agreement with us operating services to operate the facility 
under the terms of these agreements  there are provisions which limit the company s participation in the management and operation of the scrubgrass project  and provisions which provide for recourse against the manager and operator for unsatisfactory performance 
however  the company does not exercise control over the operation or management of the scrubgrass project 
as such  decisions may be made affecting the scrubgrass project  notwithstanding the company s opposition  which may have an adverse effect on the company 
scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns the scrubgrass project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns 
periodically  the scrubgrass project incurs scheduled shutdowns in order to perform maintenance procedures to equipment that cannot be performed while the equipment is operating 
occasionally  the scrubgrass project may also incur unscheduled shutdowns or may be required to operate at reduced capacity levels following the detection of equipment malfunctions  or following minimum generation orders received by the utility 
during periods when the scrubgrass project is shutdown or operating at reduced capacity levels  the company may incur losses due to the loss of its operating revenues and or due to additional costs which may be required to complete any maintenance procedures 
it is not possible for the company to predict the frequency of future unscheduled shutdowns or to predict the extent of maintenance which may be required during shutdowns related to equipment maintenance 
legal proceedings as discussed in item and note n to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in a legal proceeding with the purchasers of the company s interest in the sunnyside project which was sold in pending the resolution of the legal proceeding  the purchasers have withheld scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the promissory notes since june  which amounted to  and  respectively as of december  in addition  the company recorded in a receivable related to a purchase price adjustment  as provided for in the purchase and sale agreement  of approximately million  of which  was received in april the balance of purchase price adjustment is also being disputed in the legal proceeding with the purchasers 
although the company s available cash and cash provided by operating activities has been sufficient to fund the company s investing and financing activities  the withholding of scheduled principal and interest payments has adversely affected the company s cash flow 
at this time  while management believes the company s position in this litigation is meritorious  the company cannot predict whether it will prevail in the litigation and to what extent it will incur professional fees to defend its position in the litigation 
an unfavorable resolution and or extensive professional fees to defend the litigation could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
financial results to date the company has incurred substantial losses  primarily due to its development activities  which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  while the company was profitable overall during  the company incurred a loss from the operation of the scrubgrass project during due to an unforeseen repair to the generator at the scrubgrass facility 
financial results can be affected by numerous factors  including without limitation general economic conditions  cyclic industry conditions  the amount and rate of growth of expenses  transportation and quality of raw materials  inflation  levels of energy rates  uncertainties relating to government and regulatory policies  the legal environment and volatile and unpredictable developments like the generator repair 
the company believes it is well positioned to handle such matters as they may arise during the course of its future business activities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
development uncertainties from time to time  the company invests its resources to develop power generating facilities or invest in other projects of a development nature 
the successful development of power generating facilities or similar projects typically require the company to obtain all of the necessary site agreements  fuel supply contracts  design build agreements  power sales contracts  licenses  environmental and other permits  local government approvals or financing commitments required to complete such projects 
however  the failure to accomplish any of the aforementioned steps could materially increase the cost or prevent the successful completion of projects under development  or cause the company to abandon the pursuit of such development projects and incur the loss of its investment to date  which could materially impact the company s business and results of operations 
potential liability  damages and insurance the company s power generation activities involve significant risks to the company for environmental damage  equipment damage and failures  personal injury and fines and costs imposed by regulatory agencies 
in the event a liability claim is made against the company  or if there is an extended outage or equipment failure or damage at the company s power plant for which it is inadequately insured or subject to a coverage exclusion  and the company is unable to defend such claim successfully or obtain indemnification or warranty recoveries  there may be a material adverse effect on the company 
circulating fluidized bed technology the company s scrubgrass project employs circulating fluidized bed technology to produce electricity 
certain aspects of this technology  as well as the conversion of waste products into electricity  are relatively new areas being explored by the alternative energy market in the last ten years 
accordingly  this technology carries greater risk than more established methods of power generation such as hydropower 
as such  the long term costs and implications of maintaining this technology have not been established by historical industry data 
customer concentration the company s power generation revenues are earned under a long term power purchase agreement with one customer  pennsylvania electric company 
the company expects that the concentration of its revenues with this customer will continue for the foreseeable future 
interest rates the company s subsidiary  as a lease cost of the scrubgrass facility  is required to fund the lessor s debt service which primarily consists of million of variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing through  an million remaining term loan maturing through  a million variable rate term loan maturing through and 
million in remaining junior subordinated debt obligations which mature through the company s subsidiary is also required to fund a variable rate working capital loan  a million variable rate term loan maturing through and million in advances from the lessor under a variable rate credit agreement executed in june the lessor entered into interest rate swaps which had the effect of fixing the interest rate on the tax exempt bonds until may  at approximately and fixing the interest rate over the life of the million remaining term loan at 
after may   the company s specified base rent was incurred based on floating rates on the lessor s tax exempt bonds 
as such  except for the lessor s million remaining term loan and 
million remaining junior subordinated debt obligations  the company will be required to fund debt service consisting of rates which will vary with market conditions 
presently  the company is not able to predict how future interest rates will affect its lease expense or debt service 
should market interest rates rise significantly  the company s operating results may be significantly impacted 
notwithstanding  the company believes the lessor has good relationships with the project lenders who would continue to support lending terms which would not have a material adverse affect on the operating results of the scrubgrass project 
however  there can be no assurance that the lessor could renegotiate its credit facilities under terms which would ensure continuing profitable operating results of the scrubgrass project 
fuel quality the company obtains waste coal primarily from coal mining companies on a long term basis because waste coal is plentiful and generally creates environmental hazards  such as acid drainage  when not disposed of properly 
the waste coal is burned in the scrubgrass facility using a circulating fluidized bed combustion system 
during the circulating fluidized bed combustion process  the waste coal is treated with other substances such as limestone 
depending on the quality of the waste coal  the facility operator may need to add additional waste coal or other substances to create the appropriate balance of substances which would result in the best fuel or sorbent consistency for power generation and compliance with air quality standards 
therefore  the cost of generating power is directly impacted by the quality of the waste coal which supplies the scrubgrass power generation facility 
the facility operator maintains certain controls over obtaining higher quality waste coal 
however certain conditions  such as poor weather  can create situations where the facility operator has less control over the quality of the waste coal 
the company cannot predict the extent to which poor fuel quality may impact its future operating results 
competition the company generates electricity using alternative energy sources which is sold on a wholesale basis under long term contracts to utilities under rates established in power purchase agreements and approved by regulatory agencies 
the independent power industry has grown rapidly over the past twenty years 
there are a large number of suppliers in the wholesale market and a surplus of capacity which has led to intense competition in this market 
the principal sources of competition in this market include traditional regulated utilities who have excess capacity  unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities  energy brokers and traders  energy service companies in the development and operation or energy producing projects and the marketing of electric energy  equipment suppliers and other non utility generators like the company 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price with competitors discovering lower cost alternatives to providing electricity 
the electric industry is also characterized by rapid changes in regulations which the company expects could continue to increase competition 
for instance  as discussed under the caption energy markets  the electric industry has been previously affected by legislation such as purpa and the energy act which have encouraged companies other than utilities to enter the electric power business by reducing regulatory constraints 
more recently  as discussed under the caption energy regulation  there has been new state legislation to deregulate the generation component of the electric business 
furthermore  as discussed under the caption energy regulation  proposed changes to repeal or modify puhca and purpa could reduce regulatory restrictions placed on electric utilities and encourage them to seek new sources of electric power 
any of these regulatory matters  among others  could increase competition for electric power 
other than the risk that penelec will seek to renegotiate the terms of the scrubgrass power purchase agreement see further discussion under the caption energy regulation  the company does not believe it will be significantly impacted by competition in the wholesale energy market since its revenues are subject to contracted rates which are substantially fixed for several years 
however  the contracted rates in the later years of the scrubgrass power purchase agreement switch to rates which vary more closely with existing market conditions 
should ensuing competition in the later years of the scrubgrass power purchase agreement create downward pressure on wholesale energy rates  the company s profitability could be impacted 
the company also competes in the market to develop power generation facilities 
the primary bases of competition in this market are the quality of development plans  the ability of the developer to finance and complete the project and the price 
in certain cases  competitive bidding for a development opportunity is required 
competition for attractive development opportunities is expected to be intense as there are a number of competitors in the industry interested in the limited number of such opportunities 
many of the companies competing in this market have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company believes its project development experience and its experience in creating strategic alignments with other development firms with greater financial and technical resources could enable it to continue to compete effectively in the development market when opportunities arise 
presently  the company believes there are limited opportunities for additional project development in the united states for projects similar to those previously developed by the company 
however  the company is currently evaluating whether it should seek development opportunities in new areas 
presently  there is significant merger and consolidation activity occurring in the electric industry 
from time to time  the company considers merger and acquisition proposals when they appear to present an opportunity to enhance shareholder value 
energy regulation the company s projects are subject to regulation under federal and state energy laws and regulations 
the company s facilities are either self certified as a qualifying facility under the purpa  or formally certified as a qualifying facility by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
pursuant to purpa  ferc has promulgated regulations which exempt certain qualifying facilities from the federal power act of  puhca  and  except under certain limited circumstances  state laws regulating the rates charged by electric utilities 
in order to qualify under purpa  the company s facilities must meet certain size  fuel and ownership requirements and or co generate 
in addition to the regulation of qualifying facilities  purpa requires that electric utilities purchase electric energy produced by qualifying facilities at negotiated rates or at a price equal to the incremental or avoided cost that would have been incurred by the utility if it were to generate the power itself or purchase it from another source 
the company is not presently subject to regulation under puhca and does not presently intend to engage in any activities that would cause it to be so regulated 
the company believes that changes in purpa  puhca and other related federal statutes could occur in the next several years 
the nature and impact of such changes on the company s projects is unknown at this time 
presently  there are several legislative proposals pending in congress which propose amendments to certain regulations promulgated by purpa 
if congress amends purpa  the statutory requirement that electric utilities purchase electricity from qualifying facilities at full avoided cost could be repealed or modified 
while current legislative proposals specify the honoring of existing contracts  the repeal or modification of these statutory purchase requirements under purpa in the future could increase pressure for electric utilities to renegotiate existing contracts 
should there be changes in statutory purchase requirements under purpa  and should these changes result in amendments which reduce the contracted rates under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  the company s results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted 
state public utility commissions  pursuant to state legislative authority  may have jurisdiction over how any new federal initiatives are implemented in each state 
although the ferc generally has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates charged by an independent power project to its wholesale customers  state public utility commissions have the practical ability to influence the establishment of such rates by asserting jurisdiction over the purchasing utility s ability to pass through the resulting cost of purchased power to its retail customers 
in addition  although thought to be unlikely  states may assert jurisdiction over the siting and construction of independent power projects and  among other things  the issuance of securities and the sale and transfer of assets 
the actual scope of jurisdiction over independent power projects by state public utility regulatory commissions varies from state to state 
presently  through its power purchase agreement with penelec  the scrubgrass project is indirectly subject to state legislation in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
in recent years  in response to changes in the electric industry  the commonwealth of pennsylvania has passed new legislation most notably in the area of deregulating the generation portion of the electric business 
on december   the commonwealth of pennsylvania passed new legislation known as the electricity generation customer choice and competition act customer choice act which became effective on january  the customer choice act permits all pennsylvania retail electric customers to choose their electric generation supplier over a phase in period which expires december  the customer choice act has required that all electric utilities file restructuring plans with the puc which  among other things  included unbundled prices for electric generation  transmission and distribution and a competitive transition charge ctc for the recovery of stranded costs which would be paid by all customers receiving distribution service and certain customers that increase their own generation of electricity 
stranded costs generally are electric generation related costs that traditionally would be recoverable in a regulated environment but may not be recoverable in a competitive electric generation market 
presently  none of the new or proposed legislation directly impacts the company since the legislation pertains to the retail market or new contracts in the wholesale market 
however  as discussed previously  the company could be impacted in the future by  among other things  increases in competition as a result of deregulation  or increasing pressure on electric utilities to renegotiate existing power contracts 
the company is actively monitoring these developments in energy proceedings in order to evaluate the impact on its projects and also to evaluate new business opportunities created by the restructuring of the electric industry 
environmental regulation the company s projects are subject to regulation under federal  state and local environmental and mining laws and regulations and must also comply with the applicable federal  state and local laws pertaining to the protection of the environment  primarily in the areas of water and air pollution 
these laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and maintaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
as regulations are enacted or adopted in any of these jurisdictions  the company cannot predict the effect of compliance therewith on its business 
the company s failure to comply with all applicable requirements could result in delays in proceeding with any projects under development or require modifications to operating facilities 
during periods of non compliance  the company s operating facilities may be forced to shutdown until the non compliances are corrected 
the company is responsible for ensuring compliance of its facilities with all applicable requirements and  accordingly  attempts to minimize these risks by dealing with reputable contractors and using appropriate technology to measure compliance with the applicable standards
