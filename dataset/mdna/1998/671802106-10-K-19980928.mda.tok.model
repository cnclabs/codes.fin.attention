overview in the second half of fiscal  the company began a period of redirection and restructuring in an effort to redefine its strategic direction and focus on its key strengths and core competencies 
a key decision was made to exit markets where the company saw limited potential for profitability and a significant dependency on the pc market and redirect resources to market opportunities where the company could utilize its core technical competencies 
the company initiated several changes in the second half of the fiscal year necessary to implement and support this redirection 
in january of  the company made a change in management by electing mr 
richard black as president to lead the operational activities of the company 
mr 
black has served on the board of directors of the company for a number of years 
david d 
tsang continued as the company s chief executive officer focusing on strategic direction for the company and customer relations 
in addition  in an effort to bring additional industry experience to its board  the company also elected mr 
young sohn  president of quantum corporation s enterprise and personal storage group  to its board of directors 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its operations along three market focused groups optical storage group  consumer group and the digital office equipment group pixel magic 
all product development and marketing efforts in the company s pc audio and d graphics businesses  businesses significantly dependent on the pc market and to which the company was a new entrant  were discontinued in the fiscal third quarter ending march  as a result of the discontinuation of these businesses  the company laid off employees and recorded a restructuring charge of million to operations and a million inventory related charge to cost of revenues related to this restructuring during the quarter ended march  the million charge consisted of approximately million for the writedown of prepaid royalties  million for severance pay and million in miscellaneous charges 
the company initiated several actions to expand its interests in its consumer business and digital office equipment business 
in the third quarter of the fiscal year  the company announced it would expand in the consumer products area by targeting new opportunities presented by the digital broadcast market by developing integrated circuits for cable  satellite and terrestrial set top boxes 
towards this end  in april of  the company acquired certain integrated circuits for the demodulation of cable and satellite digital television signals from odeum microsystems  inc odeum 
with the acquisition  the company acquired an integrated mpeg audio video decoder and transport demultiplexor and a dvb s compliant qspk demodulator as well as a core group of hardware and software engineers 
the products acquired from odeum are used predominately in free to air satellite and cable set top boxes for mpeg encoded digital television broadcasting and therefore  represented the company s first step in expanding its consumer group and serving the digital broadcast market 
the assets of odeum were acquired for  in cash 
the company also established a subsidiary in germany oak technology gmbh to support the sales and engineering efforts associated with the digital television market 
in addition  a subsidiary was established in bristol  uk oak technology  ltd 
in the third quarter of the fiscal year to house the design team the company hired to design integrated circuits for the digital terrestrial broadcast market 
in the third quarter of the fiscal year  the company also announced its intention to continue to grow its digital office equipment business through research investment and acquisition and acted on its intention by acquiring xli  a company with resolution enhancement technology 
xerographic laser images corporation xli is a provider of print quality enhancement technology for the digital office equipment market 
xli will operate as a division of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pixel magic  and will serve to leverage pixel magic s position in the digital office equipment market by broadening pixel magic s expertise in resolution enhancement technology 
as the customer base for both pixel magic and xli are nearly identical  the benefits for current and potential customers include the meshing of technology expertise in silicon integration and manufacturing  image processing and resolution enhancement 
the company made a cash payment of  to the xli shareholders on the effective date of the merger and such shareholders have the right to receive additional payments of up to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones by xli over a three year period ending december  in july  the company continued its restructuring efforts by cutting development projects of minimal value to the redirection of the company and reducing engineering headcount associated with those projects in the first quarter of fiscal the company also reduced its administrative overhead by cutting administrative projects and headcount 
the reduction represented a headcount of and an annual permanent saving in salaries and benefits of approximately six million dollars 
during the second half of the fiscal year  as evidence of its commitment to its redirection and restructuring  the company initiated three acquisitions in each of its three target markets and one additional investment related to its optical storage market 
two acquisitions  odeum and xli  are described above 
one acquisition and the investment were completed in fiscal and the other two acquisitions were completed in fiscal in july  the company acquired viewpoint  a privately held company that was developing solutions for the cd rw drive market 
viewpoint technology  inc viewpoint had developed a controller that supports high encoding speeds for cd rw drives and this component complements the company s expertise in the block decoder area and will be utilized in the company s next generation cd rw drives 
the company paid  in cash for all the outstanding shares of viewpoint 
in april  the company entered into several agreements with omni peripherals pte 
ltd 
omni and two other investors pursuant to which the company acquired a preferred equity interest in omni 
as a group  the three preferred investors own of the issued stock of omni 
omni was incorporated in singapore on january   and is in the business of designing  developing  and marketing mechatronics modules for optical storage drives 
the company intends to assist omni in the design and marketing of its mechatronics modules thereby enabling the company to offer a complete solution to its customers 
the company paid approximately  for its interest  representing approximately of the issued stock of omni 
the acquisitions of odeum  xli and viewpoint have been or will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the investment in omni has been recorded under the equity method of accounting 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as repositioned  the company provides high performance  integrated semiconductors to original equipment manufacturers oems worldwide who serve the optical storage  consumer electronics and digital office equipment markets 
the company s products  consisting primarily of integrated circuits and supporting software and firmware  enable its oem customers to deliver cost effective  powerful systems to the end user for storage  home entertainment and imaging copy  fax  print applications 
one of the world s leading merchant suppliers of controllers for cd rom and cd rw drives  the company s planned product offerings for its three target market segments have expanded to include  in addition to optical storage controllers  mpeg and mpeg audio video decoders for videocd vcd and dvd players  and integrated circuits for digital broadcast systems such as cable  satellite and terrestrial set top boxes 
in addition  the company s subsidiary  pixel magic  designs multitasking imaging and compression processors for the emerging class of digital office equipment 
the company s mission is to continue to seek opportunities for value added silicon in these emerging market segments where it can leverage its core competencies to offer powerful  cost effective and complete solutions to its oem partners 
the company reported a net loss for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of of approximately million and million  respectively 
these losses were due to a number of factors currently affecting the company s optical storage business  including  but not limited to  new competitors entering the market  a maturation of the cd rom controller market  pressure from the sub pc segment for low cost components  uncertain demand for personal computers and delays in new product releases 
together with its fourth quarter fiscal earnings announcement  in july of fiscal the company announced that it expected a loss for the first fiscal quarter of as ongoing pricing and competitive pressures in the cd rom controller market as well as previous delays in product development in the optical storage area continued to affect revenue 
for fiscal  the company expects that a majority of its revenue will continue to be generated by its cd rom controller product line as the company transitions to its next generation cd rw product and its first generation product for dvd and continues its development in products for the emerging digital broadcast and digital office equipment markets 
in both fiscal and fiscal  the company initiated actions with the international trade commission itc in an effort to protect its intellectual property 
the complaints filed by the company allege that certain asian importers or sellers of optical storage controller devices are violating us trade laws by importing or reselling devices that infringe one or more us patent owned by the company 
with respect to the itc action initiated in fiscal  the company recorded as non operating income in approximately million in settlement from one of the companies and obtained a royalty bearing license from another company 
the itc action commenced in fiscal is scheduled for trial on january  in connection with this remaining itc action  as well as related legal proceedings  the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial legal and other expenses see legal proceedings 
in the third quarter of the fiscal year  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of its common stock  either in the open market or in private transactions 
the repurchase program was authorized for one year  unless further extended by the company s board of directors 
as of june   the company had purchased approximately  shares for approximately million 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses acquisition related charges restructuring charges operating income loss non operating income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
the company s net revenues in the comparison periods were primarily derived from product sales 
net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in revenues from the sales of cd rom controller products and videocd products partially offset by an increase in revenues from the sale of digital office equipment products 
the decrease in revenues from cd rom controller products was primarily due to a decrease in the asps of the products partially offset by an increase in unit sales 
the decrease in revenues from videocd products was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales as well as a decrease in asps 
the increase in revenues from the sales of digital office equipment products was primarily the result of an increase in unit sales partially offset by a decrease in asps 
net revenues from sales of the company s cd rom controller products were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  accounting for and of net revenues  respectively 
although the company is attempting to diversify its revenue product base in the three core markets of optical storage  consumer electronics and digital office equipment  it anticipates that cd rom controller sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
net revenues from sales to the company s top ten customers in fiscal and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
international sales  principally to japan  taiwan  korea and belgium accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease in international sales  as a percentage of total sales  is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues as well as an increase in revenues of pixel magic  which are primarily domestic  in the comparison periods 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  of nonrefundable technology license fees 
sales of products related to the graphics and audio communications businesses which the company discontinued in the quarter ended march   accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal includes the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year as well as a million charge related to the discontinuation of the graphics and audio communications businesses 
excluding the impact of these inventory related charges  gross margin in fiscal would have been 
gross margin in fiscal includes the impact of a charge to cost of revenues related to increases in inventory reserves of million recorded during the year 
additionally  gross margin in fiscal includes the impact of favorable adjustments to cost of revenues of approximately million associated with the sale of products which had been fully reserved in a prior period as well as manufacturing cost adjustments of million related to foundry agreements 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross margin for fiscal would have been 
the increase in gross margin during the comparison periods  excluding the impact of the adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal  is primarily the result of a product mix shift to higher margin cd rw controllers and digital office equipment products during the comparison periods 
gross margins related to the graphics and audio communications businesses which the company discontinued in the quarter ended march  accounted for less than and of the company s total gross margin contribution in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including  among others  competitive product pricing  yields  wafer costs  assembly and test costs  product design changes and product mix 
the company expects that asps for its existing products will continue to decline over time and that asps for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
the company is currently experiencing severe price pressure on its cd rom controller and videocd products and expects such price erosion to continue 
a decline in asps that is not offset by cost reductions through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  yield improvement  savings negotiated with its manufacturing subcontractors or by sales of new products with higher gross margins would decrease the company s overall gross margin and could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company does not believe that it can achieve cost reductions or sales of new products with higher gross margins which fully offset the expected price declines of its cd rom and videocd products and therefore  it expects gross margin percentages to decline for such products 
in addition  the company believes that gross margins for new products in its optical storage market and the video disk portion of the consumer markets will be lower than historical levels and that  as a result  gross margins in general will decline in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs are all expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues were and in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase in research and development expenditures in fiscal  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses 
the company will continue to invest substantial resources in research and development in an effort to complete the development of its new products in the company s core technologies optical storage  consumer electronics and digital office equipment 
the company expects to hold research and development expenses flat in absolute dollar terms in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to salaries  commissions  legal fees  consulting and other costs related to the sales  marketing and administrative functions of the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was principally the result of the hiring of additional management and administrative personnel and associated expenses  costs associated with the implementation of a new management information system as well as increases in legal expenses 
the increase in legal expenses relates primarily to the complaints the company filed with the itc on july  and april  itc complaints and additional litigation related to a settlement agreement with one of the parties in the july itc complaint 
see legal proceedings 
the company expects to incur higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges include the costs associated with the acquisitions of pixel magic and the acquisition of certain assets of odeum 
in march  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with odeum and hyundai electronics america pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire certain assets of odeum for million 
the transaction was consummated in april and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
approximately million of the initial cash payment was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal in june  the company waived certain of the performance criteria and agreed to pay the contingent amount of million in two installments during calendar the first payment of million was paid in january and the second payment of million is due in december as a result of this agreement and because the contingent amount was based  in part  on the continued employment of the former shareholder employees of pixel magic  the company recorded a compensation charge of million in fiscal restructuring charges 
during  the company discontinued its graphics and audio communications businesses and incurred a charge to operations of approximately million related to these discontinued businesses 
the million charge consisted of million related to a write off of prepaid royalties  approximately million for severance pay and for miscellaneous charges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
non operating income  net 
non operating income  net consisted primarily of net interest income of million  net foreign currency exchange losses of million and approximately million related to the settlement agreement between the company and united microelectronics corporation in connection with a complaint the company filed with the itc on july  see legal proceedings 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in effective rate is primarily due to the company s continued decrease in taxable income along with the substantial research and development credits earned by the company  offset by a partial valuation allowance recorded during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
the company s net revenues in the comparison periods were primarily derived from product sales 
net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in unit sales and average selling prices of cd rom controllers in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in unit sales resulted from the company receiving substantially fewer orders for its cd rom controller products in fiscal than in fiscal net revenues from sales of the company s cd rom controller products were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  accounting for and of net revenues  respectively 
net revenues from sales to the company s top ten customers in fiscal and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
international sales  principally to japan  taiwan  korea and singapore accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  of nonrefundable technology license fees 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
the company s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of adjustments of approximately million to cost of revenues associated with the sale of products which had been fully reserved in prior periods as well as manufacturing cost adjustments of million related to foundry agreements 
additionally  fiscal gross margins were reduced as a result of inventory related charges to cost of sales of million 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross margin for fiscal and would have been approximately and respectively 
this adjusted gross margin decreased from the comparable period in fiscal primarily as a result of a decrease in asps of the company s cd rom controller products that was not offset by a comparable decrease in product costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million  and expressed as a percentage of net revenues and in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
research and development expenses increased as percentage of net revenues in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in the company s net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million and expressed as a percentage of net revenues and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
the increase as a percentage of net revenues was due primarily to the decrease in the company s net revenues 
acquisition related charges 
in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was paid up front and million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
in june  the company waived certain of the performance criteria and agreed to pay the contingent amount of million in two installments during calendar the first payment of million was paid in january and the second payment of million is due in december as a result of this agreement and because the contingent earn out was based  in part  on the continued employment of the former shareholder employees of pixel magic  the company recorded a compensation charge of million in the quarter ended june  non operating income  net 
non operating income  net consisted primarily of net interest income in fiscal non operating income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of lower net interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in was primarily attributable to the effect of the reinstated research and development tax credit on fiscal results as well as geographical shift in the sources of taxable income in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
quarterly fluctuations the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the gain or loss of significant customers  increased competitive pressures  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products 
other factors include the availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials and manufacturing capacity  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in general  the market for pcs and the markets addressed by the company s products  seasonal customer demand  the company s ability to diversify its product offerings  short product life cycles  the competitiveness of the company s customers  the timing of significant orders  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations and development of the company s support infrastructure  high fixed costs and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  including decreases in asps of the company s products 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected by legal expenses incurred in connection with  or any adverse judgment in  the company s ongoing shareholder legal proceedings and itc actions 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  or by order cancellations or rescheduling 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales or earnings that may be attained by the company in any given period in the future 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
the downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both the semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production overcapacity and subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and in some cases  have lasted for more than a year 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy  and the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by a significant industry wide downturn 
the semiconductor industry also has been characterized by periods of rapid expansion of production capacity 
even if customers aggregate demand were not to decline  the availability of additional capacity can adversely impact pricing levels  which can also depress revenue levels 
also  during such periods  customers benefiting from shorter lead times may delay some purchases into future periods 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience such downturns in the future  which could have a material impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently places noncancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis and is currently committed with two of its foundries for certain minimum amounts of capacity for the next several years  while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be rescheduled or under certain circumstances may be canceled without significant penalty 
due to the company s relatively narrow customer base for certain devices and the short product life cycles of such products  such cancellations can leave the company with significant inventory exposure  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are rescheduled  canceled  or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter or for the year would be materially adversely affected 
legal proceedings the company and various of its current and former officers and directors are parties to certain legal proceedings 
see legal proceedings 
all of these actions are in the early stages of proceedings and the company is currently investigating the allegations 
based on its current information  the company believes the suits to be without merit and will defend its position vigorously 
no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these legal proceedings  the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  substantial legal and other expenses 
shareholder suits of this kind are highly complex and can extend for a protracted period of time  which can substantially increase the cost of such litigation and divert the attention of the company s management 
pricing issues the willingness of prospective customers to design the company s products into their products depends to a significant extent upon the ability of the company to have products available at the appropriate market window and to price its products at a level that is cost effective for such customers 
the markets for most of the applications for the company s products  particularly the consumer products market and optical storage market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for the company s products mature and competition increases  as has been the trend for the cd rom market  the company anticipates that asps on its products will decline 
the company continually attempts to pursue cost reductions  including process enhancements  in order to maintain acceptable gross profit margins 
gross profit margins also vary reflecting the impact of changes in the general condition of the economy  capacity utilization levels in the semiconductor industry  customer acceptance of new technologies and products  product functionality and capabilities  shifts in product mix  manufacturing yields and the effect of ongoing manufacturing cost reduction activities 
if the company is unable to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset declines in asps or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher asps  the company s operating results will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the company experiences yield or other production problems or shortages of supply that increase its manufacturing costs  or fails to reduce its manufacturing costs  the result would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
new product introductions the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s performance is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
currently  the majority of the company s revenues are generated from sales of mature cd rom controller products and therefore  company s financial performance is dependent upon timely and successful execution of new products in the optical storage business 
the company has recently experienced some product development delays in this area 
in an effort to diversify its product and market base  the company has invested substantial resources in optical storage as well as in its other core technologies  consumer electronics and digital imaging 
there can be no assurance that products currently under development in these core technologies or any other new products will be successfully developed or will achieve market acceptance  thereby affecting the company s ability to achieve diversification of its products and markets  and thereby revenue diversification 
the failure of the company to introduce new products successfully or the failure of new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including recognition of market requirements  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  improvement of existing technologies and development and implementation of new process technologies in order to continue to reduce semiconductor die size  improve device performance and manufacturing yields  adapt products and processes to technological changes and adopt emerging industry standards 
the company s success is also dependent upon securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers and achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields from the company s contract manufacturers 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change 
decreases in geometries call for sophisticated design efforts  advanced manufacturing equipment and cleaner fabrication environments 
due to the design complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays in completing development and introduction of new products  and there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter such delays in the development and introduction of future products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  that the company s products will be selected for design into the products of its targeted customers or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the products of the company s customers will be successfully introduced into the market 
the failure of the company s new product development efforts  the failure of the company to achieve market acceptance of its new products and the failure of the products of the company s customers to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
need for additional capital the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make significant investments in new facilities and capital equipment 
the company spent million on capital additions in and expects to spend significant amounts in future years 
the company believes that existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  if any  combined with its ability to borrow funds will be adequate to meet its operating and capital requirements and obligations into the foreseeable future 
the company believes that a company s level of financial resources is an important factor in its industry 
accordingly  the company may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the company when needed 
any future equity financing will also lead to dilution to the existing stockholders 
acquisitions the company has begun to pursue  and will continue to pursue  opportunities to acquire key technology to augment its technical capabilities or to achieve faster time to market as alternatives to internally developing such technology 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the coordination of sales  marketing and research and development  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in addition  investments in emerging technology present risks of loss of value of one or more of the investments due to failure of the technology to gain the predicted market acceptance 
the company  in order to remain competitive  must also maintain its ability to manage any growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by the company could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
in addition  with such acquisitions  there is the risk that future operating performance may be unfavorably impacted due to acquisition related costs such as  but not limited to  in process research and development charges  additional development expenses  lower gross margins generated by the sales of acquired products and restructuring costs associated with duplicate facilities 
intellectual property matters the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company considers its technology to be proprietary and relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company currently has eleven patents granted  forty seven patents in preparation in the united states  fifty three patents pending in the united states and tewnty two international patents pending 
the company intends to seek additional international patents and additional united states patents on its technology 
there can be no assurance that additional patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or applications in preparation  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
additionally  competitors of the company may be able to design around the company s patents 
there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
an action is currently pending in the federal district court for the northern district of california seeking to invalidate one of the company s patents relating to it s optical storage products 
moreover  while the company holds or has applied for patents relating to the design of its products  the company s products are based in part on standards  including mpeg  mpeg  jpeg and jbig and the company does not hold patents or other intellectual property rights for such standards 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant  often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation against the company  the company or its foundries may  from time to time  be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by the company s foundries of processes requiring the technology 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
in fiscal and again in fiscal  the company filed a complaint with the itc against certain asian manufacturers of optical storage controller devices based on the company s belief that such devices infringed one or more of the company s patents 
the complaint seeks a ban on the importation into the united states of any infringing cd rom controller or products containing such infringing cd rom controllers 
see legal proceedings 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and any such development or license could require expenditures by the company of substantial time and other resources 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because the company has a limited portfolio of patents  the company may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
if a successful claim is made against the company or its customers and a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or the company is required to pay substantial damages or awards  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties  and pursuant thereto the company is required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and in certain cases pay royalties 
some of the company s products  particularly those targeted for the dvd market  require certain types of copy protection software that the company must license from third parties 
should the company lose its rights to or be unable to obtain the necessary copy protection software  the company would unable to sell and market certain of its products 
the company licenses technology from sun microsystems  inc for use in its consumer products under an agreement requiring royalty payments  and also has a number of joint development and supply arrangements  and on occasion buys products off the shelf for use with its own products 
the company s agreements with third parties  such as advanced micro devices  inc  often have no specified term and may be terminated by either party in the event of breach by the other 
the company s business could be adversely affected by the loss for any reason of this and other agreements 
in the future  it may be necessary or desirable for the company to seek additional licenses to intellectual property rights held by third parties or purchase products manufactured and or sold by third parties with respect to some or all of its product offerings 
there can be no assurance that such licenses or purchases will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the inability of the company to enter into such license arrangements on acceptable terms or to maintain its current licenses on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and confidentiality and license agreements with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
under some circumstances  the company grants licenses that give its customers limited access to the source code of the company s software which increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of the company s technology 
accordingly  despite precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s technology or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach or misappropriation by others 
manufacturing issues the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its products  enabling the company to focus on its design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
certain of the company s foundry agreements require up front  nonrefundable prepayments or deposits and these fixed costs could affect the company s operating margins if the company is unable to utilize the minimum number of wafers required under the agreements 
the company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver products to the company in a timely manner 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and some manufacture products of their own design 
while the company believes there is adequate foundry capacity available to meet its current requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to have access to sufficient capacity to meet its needs in the future 
if there is a decrease in available foundry capacity  it is likely that the lead time required to manufacture the company s products will increase 
product supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the additions of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
the industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in to what appears to be a current period of excess capacity for the immediate future 
during a period of industry overcapacity  profitability can drop sharply as factory utilization declines and high fixed costs of operating a wafer fabrication facility are spread over a lower net revenue base 
despite industry overcapacity  there can be no assurance that the company can achieve timely  cost effective access to such capacity when needed 
the company generally does not have long term volume production contracts with its customers 
whether any specific product design will result in volume production orders and  if so  the quantities included in any such orders  are factors beyond the control of the company 
insufficient orders could result in an inability to utilize the company s foundry deposits and prepayments with tsmc and chartered  thereby adversely impacting the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s results of operations could also be adversely affected if particular suppliers are unable to provide a sufficient and timely supply of product  whether because of raw material shortages  capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the plants  delays in qualifying new suppliers or other reasons  or if the company is forced to purchase materials from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply  or if the company s test facilities are disrupted for an extended period of time 
production could also be constrained by delays if there is a need to move production from one facility to another 
such problems with supply could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company had anticipated that it would be able to satisfy a small portion of its manufacturing requirements from uicc  however  due to the october fire at the uicc  the company will not be able to utilize this foundry in the foreseeable future 
uicc management has indicated that capacity will be available through substitute capacity arrangements  however  no assurance can be given as to the availability of such capacity 
the loss of any of the company s foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company in a period of increased demand for its products to expand the foundry capacity of its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity  industry overcapacity  any inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from the company s current or future suppliers or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could delay shipments of the company s products  which could damage relationships with its current and prospective customers  provide an advantage to the company s competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
disruption of operations at any of the manufacturing facilities utilized by the company or any of its subcontractors for any reason  including work stoppages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters  would cause delays in shipments of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that alternative capacity would be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the company  if at all  thereby resulting in a loss of customers 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in october  a fire damaged the uicc facility 
uicc management has publicly stated that a majority of the equipment and inventory and a significant portion of the building were completely destroyed at an estimated loss of approximately million based on year end exchange rates 
uicc management has also stated that it has reached a million insurance settlement for claims stemming from the fire and that in accordance with the coinsurance clause  uicc had to pay million of the damage 
despite the damages payment  uicc management has represented that uicc s financial status has remained unaffected given significant investment gains made during the year 
uicc has further stated that it expects to complete reinforcement of the building structure before the end of the year  to install fab equipment by may  and to be in production by the last quarter of calendar  using primarily 
micron process technology 
given the fire  the company has evaluated its investment in the uicc facility to determine whether there has been an impairment and as the company believes that estimated future cash inflows expected to be generated by the facility and or disposition of the investment are in excess of the carrying amount of the investment  no impairment loss has been recognized as of june  representations have been made by uicc management that the facility s foundry capacity that has been guaranteed to the company will be available through substitute capacity arrangements 
to date  the company has not requested that uicc make such substitute capacity available to the company 
therefore  there can be no assurance that such substitute foundry capacity will be available to the company should the company require it 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a market will develop for the shares representing the company s equity investment at any time in the future 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process  with current trends in the company s markets leading to increasingly complex products 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
the company s products are particularly complex and difficult to manufacture 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the company s products increase the risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs for product warranty 
the relationships with customers could also be adversely impacted 
there can be no assurance that the company s foundries will not experience irregularities or adverse yield fluctuations in their manufacturing processes 
any yield or other production problems or shortages of supply experienced by the company or its foundries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involves a number of additional risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
in addition  as a result of the company s dependence on foreign subcontractors  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general political risks  such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions  and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
dependence on cd rom controller market sales of the company s cd rom controller products comprised  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of cd rom controller products are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s total revenues for fiscal the market for cd rom controller products continues to mature and therefore  it is expected that sales of such products will not necessarily continue to grow at historical rates and will be influenced by the traditional seasonality and volatility associated with the pc market 
it is further anticipated that the proliferation of cd rw and dvd drives will impact the demand for cd rom controller products 
due to the backward compatibility of dvd rom drives  it is critical that the company maintain its cd rom customer base throughout this transition to dvd rom 
although the company is currently shipping a cd rw controller and is pursuing the development of optical storage semiconductors for use in dvd rom drives  there can be no assurance that the company will develop successive generations of its cd rw product or its first dvd product  that such product will be available within an acceptable market window  or that such product will be able to sustain the current level of optical storage product sales 
as the cd rom market has begun to mature and transition toward the emerging cd rw and dvd rom markets  there have been a number of new competitors entering the market 
this increased competition combined with the pressure from the sub pc segment for lower cost components have caused tremendous price erosion on cd rom controller prices 
in addition  as a majority of the new competitors are located in asia  together with a majority of the company s customers  the company is currently hampered in its ability to effectively compete given the effects of the strong dollar versus asian currencies 
furthermore  there is currently a trend toward integrating increased functionality on the cd rom controller 
therefore  the company s revenues and its gross margins from its cd rom controller products will be dependent on the company s ability to introduce such integrated products in a commercially competitive manner 
the company has not previously offered an integrated cd rom controller product that provides functions that had traditionally been supplied by separate  single function chips 
the company is currently experiencing development delays with its first integrated cd rom controller product 
to provide integrated cd rom controller products  the company has been and will continue to be required to expand the scope of its research and development efforts to provide these new functions  which will require the hiring of engineers skilled in the respective areas and additional management coordination among the company s engineering and marketing groups 
alternatively  the company may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to enable the company to provide these functions  and there can be no assurance that any such technology will be available for license or purchase on acceptable terms to the company 
in addition  with new functions being added to the cd rom controller product  companies that historically provided chips with these functions are now entering the cd rom controller market with integrated products containing these functions as well as the controller function 
accordingly  given the above stated factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain the current level of such product sales or current operating margins 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the market for cd rom controller products in general  or the company s cd rom controller products in particular  will support the company s planned operations in the future 
any decrease in the overall level of sales of  or the prices for  the company s cd rom controller products  due to introductions of products by present or future competitors  a decline in demand for cd rom controller products  product obsolescence or any other reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks pertaining to international business during fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues were derived from international sales 
a substantial portion of the company s international revenues in fiscal  and were derived from manufacturers of cd rom drives in japan  taiwan  korean  belgium and singapore 
most of the company s foreign sales are negotiated in us dollars  however  invoicing is generally done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities which are denominated in non functional currencies are remeasured into the functional currency on a monthly basis and the resulting gain or loss is recorded within non operating income in the statement of operations 
many of the company s non functional currency receivables and payables are hedged through managing net asset positions  product pricing and other means 
the company s strategy is to minimize its non functional currency net assets or net liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries 
the company s policy is not to speculate in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuations  trade in currencies for which there are not underlying exposures  or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 
the company uses financial instruments  including local currency debt arrangements  to offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments against gains or losses on the underlying operations cash flows or investments 
the company expects that there could be hedges of anticipated transactions or investments in foreign subsidiaries in the future 
the company is also subject to the additional risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
with the current economic problems in asia and the strengthening of the dollar  the company has recently experienced a more conservative buying pattern from its customers and increased price pressure on its products 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results or require the company to modify its current business practices 
limited customer base a limited number of customers historically has accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
these customers were all purchasers of the company s cd rom product 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and lg electronics accounted for of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and lg electronics accounted for of the company s net revenues 
kanematsu  a japanese trading company  purchases product from the company and resells the product to japanese manufacturers 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for  kanematsu accounted for and nec accounted for of the company s net revenues 
although the company is currently attempting to diversify its products  markets  and customer base  the company expects that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern will continue 
for example  mitsumi has only been a significant customer of the company since fiscal the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
customers generally purchase the company s products pursuant to short term purchase orders 
the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers such as mitsumi or lg electronics would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurances that the company s current customers will continue to place orders or that existing orders will not be canceled 
if sales to current customers cease or are reduced  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain the orders from new customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions 
the loss of business or cancellation of orders from any key customers  significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers or decreases in the prices of products sold to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining unit asps and rapid product obsolescence 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the company s competitors also include a number of emerging companies as well as some of the company s own customers and suppliers 
the company is currently attempting to enter several new markets in which the company has not previously operated 
these markets are intensely competitive and the company will have to compete with large domestic and international companies that have long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
specifically  the company s ability to compete successfully in the dvd and other markets will depend on its ability to develop partnerships with other companies established in the industries and to gain recognition in such markets 
in the dvd area  it is important that the company form alliances with those companies that are members of the dvd forum 
there can be no assurance that participation in these new markets will produce positive results for the company 
certain of the company s principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technological advantages 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control  including the price  quality and performance of the company s and its customers products  the timing and success of new product introductions by the company  its customers and its competitors  the emergence of new pc standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the efficiency of production  the rate at which the company s customers design the company s products into their products  the market acceptance of the products of the company s customers  the number and nature of the company s competitors in a given market  the assertion of intellectual property rights and general market and economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on key personnel the company s future performance depends  to a significant degree  on the retention and contribution of members of the company s senior management as well as other key personnel 
three of the company s most senior finance personnel  including the chief financial officer  as well as the president of the company s optical storage group recently left the company 
the company is in the process of recruiting their replacements as well as additional senior managers and technical personnel 
competition for these persons is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified replacements or additional senior managers and technical personnel 
year risk factor many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is currently installing various new internal information systems in connection with operating its business 
the company believes that these systems are year compliant  although there can be no assurance that unexpected problems will not occur 
the company is assessing its products to ensure that they are year compliant 
the ongoing assessment has not revealed any significant compliance issues 
however  the inability of these products to properly manage and manipulate data in the year could result in increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues  potential lawsuits and other material problems 
the company has also initiated communications with its suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company s capabilities are vulnerable to those third parties own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems and products of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the year on its products  suppliers and customers  but has not yet completed the process 
as a result  the company has no reasonable basis to conclude that the year problem will not materially affect the company s operations 
upon completion of its assessment process  the company will determine a contingency plan if the assessment process leads the company to believe that the year problem will materially affect its operations 
changes to management information systems since its inception  the company has experienced significant growth in the number of its employees and in the scope of its operating and financial systems 
to manage growth effectively  the company will need to continue to improve its operational  financial and marketing information systems  procedures and controls  and expand  train  and manage its employee base 
the company is in the final stages of implementing a new management information system 
any problems encountered with the new system could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated from operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and long term and short term debt 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of june  consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company also has approximately million in lines of letters of credit with taiwanese financial institutions  of which all but  was available at june  additionally  approximately million in lines of credit exist with japanese financial institutions  of which approximately million was available at june  in fiscal  operating activities provided net cash of approximately million 
this cash resulted primarily from net income of approximately million  utilization of foundry deposits of million  an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of million  and the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization on income of million offset primarily by a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and taxes payable of million 
investing activities utilized cash of approximately million primarily due to an investment in the foundry joint venture of million and additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities provided net cash of approximately million 
this cash resulted primarily from net income of approximately million 
approximately million in cash was used to finance additions to property and equipment and million to finance an investment in a foundry joint venture 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities provided net cash of approximately million 
this cash resulted primarily from net income of approximately million 
approximately million in cash was used to finance additions to property and equipment 
in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
approximately million of the initial cash payment was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal in june  the company waived certain of the performance criteria and agreed to pay the contingent amount of million in two installments during calendar the first payment of million is due in january and the second payment of million is due in december as a result of this agreement and because the contingent amount was based  in part  on the continued employment of the former shareholder employees of pixel magic  the company recorded a compensation charge of million in the quarter ended june  on august   the company acquired xerographic laser images  inc xli to operate as a division of pixel magic 
the company made a cash payment of  to the xli shareholders on the effective date of the merger and the shareholders have the right to receive additional payments of up to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones by xli over a year period ending december  on july   the company acquired viewpoint technology  inc viewpoint  paying approximately  in cash for all the outstanding shares of viewpoint 
on april   the company acquired certain assets from odem microsystems  inc odeum for  in cash 
on april   the company entered into agreements whereby it acquired a preferred equity interest in omni peripherals pte 
ltd 
omni  paying approximately  for its minority interest 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and credit facilities will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital and to fund necessary purchases of property and equipment through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for fiscal are anticipated to be approximately million 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
however  the company has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies 
foundry deposits and investment in foundry venture the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its semiconductor products  enabling the company to focus on its design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
the company s primary suppliers under such arrangements during fiscal were tsmc and lg semicon co 
ltd 
in korea 
the company also uses wafer fabrication facilities at chartered  rohm  nec and sony 
except as described in the paragraphs below  the foundries generally are not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at a specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
in june and november  the company entered into agreements with tsmc and chartered to obtain certain additional wafer capacity through the year the agreements call for the company to commit to certain future wafer purchases and to deposit funds with the suppliers as either a portion of the price of the additional wafers in advance of their delivery or as a non interest bearing deposit to secure the availability of additional wafers 
the price of such wafers will be determined in the future periods in which specific orders are actually placed 
if the company is not able to use  assign  or sell the additional wafer quantities  all or a portion of the deposits may be forfeited 
in october  the company amended its previous agreement with tsmc resulting in a reduction of the company s future wafer purchases required under the original agreement and the elimination of required future cash prepayments of approximately million 
under the amended agreement  no additional prepayment is required  however the company must utilize the entire amount of the prepayment paid as of october through a certain committed amount of wafer purchases in calendar years   and or a portion of the prepayment will be forfeited 
in march  the company further amended its agreement with tsmc allowing the company to utilize excess wafer purchases in and to reduce the company s committed wafer purchases in the following years 
this amendment resulted in the company utilizing calendar committed wafer purchases beginning in calendar after the committed wafer purchases for calendar were met 
as a result of this amendment  the company recorded a credit to foundry deposits of approximately million which was used to offset payables to tsmc during fiscal the company currently believes the terms and conditions of the agreement  as amended  will be met although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in september  april and september  the company amended its agreement with chartered 
the amendments resulted in a reduction of the company s future wafer purchase commitments and the elimination of required future cash deposits under the original agreement of approximately million 
under the amended agreement  the required future cash deposits of approximately million could be reinstated if certain conditions are not met 
the company currently believes the terms and conditions of the agreement  as amended  will be met and that these commitments will not be reinstated although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the deposits and prepayments under the amended foundry agreements described above are recorded at cost and total approximately million as of june  the company currently anticipates being able to utilize and fully recover the value of all foundry prepayments and deposits under the terms of the amended agreements although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in october  the company entered into a series of agreements with united microelectronics corporation umc to form  along with other investors  a separate taiwanese company  united integrated circuits corporation uicc  for the purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan  republic of china 
as an investor in this venture  the company has rights to a portion of the total wafer capacity for the manufacture of its proprietary products 
the company paid approximately million for approximately of the total outstanding shares of the foundry venture 
the investment in uicc has been accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
in october  a fire damaged the uicc facility 
uicc management has publicly stated that a majority of the equipment and inventory and a significant portion of the building were completely destroyed at an estimated loss of approximately million based on year end exchange rates 
uicc management has also stated that it has reached a million insurance settlement for claims stemming from the fire and that in accordance with the coinsurance clause  uicc had to pay million of the damage 
despite the damages payment  uicc management has represented that uicc s financial status has remained unaffected given significant investment gains made during the year 
uicc has further stated that it expects to complete reinforcement of the building structure before the end of the year  to install fab equipment by may  and to be in production by the last quarter of calendar  using primarily 
micron process technology 
given the fire  the company has evaluated its investment in the uicc facility to determine whether there has been an impairment and as the company believes that estimated future cash inflows expected to be generated by the facility and or disposition of the investment are in excess of the carrying amount of the investment  no impairment loss has been recognized as of june  representations have been made by uicc management that the facility s foundry capacity that has been guaranteed to the company will be available through substitute capacity arrangements 
to date  the company has not requested that uicc make such substitute capacity available to the company 
therefore  there can be no assurance that such substitute foundry capacity will be available to the company should the company require it 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a market will develop for the shares representing the company s equity investment at any time in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate some of these risks  the company utilzes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of the company s investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on the company s debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the company s debt obligations as well the fact that such obligations are not significant 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and new taiwan dollars 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established certain revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
the company s hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in certain asian currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s balances as of june
