based on the current status of its product development and commercialization plans  the company believes its cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs through at least the calendar year however  the company s actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and the ability of the company to market and distribute its products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
the company s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds 
the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
the failure of the company to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future operating results 
impact of year the company believes that with upgrades to its existing software and conversions to new software  all of which are readily available in the market  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its internal computer systems 
all required modifications and conversions of computer systems that are critical to the company s business operations are expected to be completed no later than june  which is prior to the estimated occurrence of any year issues 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse impact on the company s systems 
the company estimates that the cost of required upgrades and conversions will not have a significant impact on its results of operations
