return on average assets increased in to from in  while the return on average equity also increased to in from in the increase in net income for the year ended december   after adjusting for one time non recurring income and expenses for each year  can be primarily attributed to an increase in net interest income of million and a reduction in income tax expense  offset by an increase of million in the provision for possible loan losses 
net interest income net interest income is the largest source of valley s operating income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for as compared to million for the increase in net interest income is due to a widening spread between the yield earned on interest earning assets and funding costs  a modest increase in interest earning assets and the movement of earning assets out of the investment portfolio and into higher yielding loans 
the net interest margin increased to for compared to for average interest earning assets increased million in  or over the amount 
this increase was mainly the result of increased volume of credit card loans  automobile loans and commercial mortgage loans 
average loans increased by million or over the amount 
the average rate on loans remained unchanged from the increase in average loan volume caused interest income on loans for to increase by million over offsetting this increase was a decline of million in average investment securities or from the amount in the portfolio during average interest bearing liabilities for remained relatively unchanged from deposits decreased slightly due to competitive factors and alternative investment opportunities for consumers

non interest income the following table presents the components of non interest income for the years ended december   and non interest income years ended december  in thousands trust income   service charges on deposit accounts    gains on securities transactions  net 
  fees from loan servicing    credit card fee income    gains on sales of loans  net   other    total    non interest income continues to represent a considerable source of income for valley 
excluding gains on securities transactions  total non interest income amounted to million in compared with million in gains on securities transactions totaled million in  compared with thousand in these gains resulted primarily from the sale of equity securities by valley national bancorp during fees from loan servicing increased by from million in to million in included in these fees are gross servicing fees and related ancillary fees for servicing mortgage portfolios earned by vnb mortgage services  inc msi  vnb s mortgage servicing subsidiary 
msi serviced a total of billion and billion of loans as of december  and  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  are serviced for vnb and its subsidiary 
the increase in the servicing portfolio was due to the acquisition of several portfolios totaling approximately million  the new origination of loans by vnb of million  fewer principal paydowns and prepayments totaling million 
amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights increased during to million from million in  reflecting the increase in the size of the serviced portfolio 
an analysis is completed quarterly to determine amortization expense  based on all expected future cash flows 
also included in fees from loan servicing are fees for servicing sba loans 
vnb serviced a total of million and million of sba loans as of december  and  respectively  for third party investors 
the increase in the serviced portfolio was due to the origination of new loans  which were sold to third party investors 
included in credit card income are primarily net interchange fees 
the increase in credit card income is the result of a co branded credit card program that began during the second quarter of  while included a full year of credit card income 
gains on the sales of loans were million for compared to million for the gains recorded are primarily from the increased volume of sba loans which resulted in increased sales of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
the significant components of other non interest income include safe deposit rentals and gain on the sale of reo property 
other non interest income increased thousand to million for the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in the increase in other non interest income was due to a one time gain of million recorded on the sale of vnb s merchant credit card business 
safe deposit rental income remained relatively unchanged and totaled thousand for gains recorded on the sale of reo property during approximated thousand compared to million in non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years ended december   and non interest expense years ended december  in thousands salary expense    employee benefit expense    fdic insurance premiums    net occupancy expense    furniture and equipment expense    credit card expense    amortization of intangible assets 
   other    total    non interest expense totaled million for  an increase of from the level 
the largest components of non interest expense are salaries and employee benefit expense which totaled million in compared to million in at december   full time equivalent staff was  compared to  at the end of the efficiency ratio measures a bank s gross operating expense as a percentage of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and other non interest income without taking into account security gains and losses and other non recurring items 
valley s efficiency ratio as of december  was  one of the lowest in the industry  compared with an efficiency ratio for of 
the efficiency ratio has been impacted by the acquisition of midland and net expenses incurred from the credit card program 
valley strives to control its efficiency ratio and expenses as a means of producing increased earnings for its shareholders 
the savings association insurance fund saif was recapitalized in the third quarter of pursuant to the funds act 
congress mandated a one time special assessment on saif assessable deposits 
included in the fdic insurance premiums is a million one time required payment 
vnb had about billion of oakar deposits at december   which are treated as saif deposits 
under the funds act  the saif was recapitalized and saif rates have been reduced 
however  under the funds act the fdic will collect premiums to pay interest on fico bonds from both saif and bif deposits in a relationship of to vnb previously paid the fico assessment only on its oakar deposits 
see supervision and regulation bif premiums and recapitalization of saif 
credit card expense includes cardmember rebates  processing expenses and fraud losses 
the increase in credit card expenses is directly attributable to a larger volume of cards  transactions and outstanding balances of the co branded credit card that vnb began issuing during the second quarter of  while includes a full year of credit card expense 
during the fourth quarter of  valley amended its credit card program 
based upon the volume of purchases incurred during  these amendments are expected to reduce the amount of cardmember rebates paid by valley during and thereafter 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of thousand or 
the majority of this increase resulted from the amortization of purchased and originated loan servicing rights totaling million during  compared with million for the significant components of other non interest expense include advertising  professional fees  postage  telephone expense and reo expense which total approximately million for on january   valley adopted sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
these standards are based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
under this approach  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
sfas no 
provides consistent standards for distinguishing between transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas no 
was effective for transfers that occured after december   and was applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on valley s financial position or results of operation 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was for the year ended december  compared to in the reduction in the effective tax rate from to is attributable to a realignment of corporate entities and a lower effective tax rate for state taxes 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is limited in duration  but may have an impact on some future periods 
year during valley established an overall plan to address system related year issues 
the plan calls for either system modification to  or replacement of  existing business systems applications 
the cost of this year compliance program related to system modifications is not expected to be material to valley s earnings in or thereafter 
such costs will be charged to expense as incurred 
valley currently anticipates that substantially all of the remaining work under this program  including the testing of critical systems  which will be initially completed by the end of  with further testing to be performed during valley continues to bear some risk related to the year issue and could be adversely affected  if other entities ie  vendors not affiliated with valley do not appropriately address their own year compliance issues 
asset liability management interest rate sensitivity valley s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of valley s net interest income to the movement in interest rates 
because valley has no trading portfolio  there is no exposure to market risk from trading activities  and valley does not currently use derivatives to manage market and interest rate risks 
valley s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco  which reports to the board of directors 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate valley s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
valley uses a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve and twenty four month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on valley s net interest income 
the following table shows the financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair value at december  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity analysis average interest rate in thousands interest sensitive assets federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity     investment securities available for sale   loans  net of unearned income commercial     mortgage     consumer     total interest sensitive assets     interest sensitive liabilities deposits savings    time     short term borrowings  other borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     interest sensitivity gap     ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities total fair thereafter balance value in thousands interest sensitive assets federal funds sold   investment securities held to maturity     investment securities available for sale   loans  net of unearned income commercial     mortgage     consumer     total interest sensitive assets     interest sensitive liabilities deposits savings   time     short term borrowings   other borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     interest sensitivity gap     ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
valley uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for investment securities held to maturity and loans  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on historical experience 
investment securities available for sale are categorized shorter than their expected maturity because they can be sold at any time to meet estimated liquidity needs 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and valley s own historical experience  decay factors  used to estimate deposit runoff of for savings 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from historical experience 
off balance sheet items are not considered material 
the total negative gap repricing within year as of december  is million or 
management does not view this amount as presenting an unusually high risk potential  although no assurances can be given that valley is not at risk from rate increases or decreases 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  investments securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
at december   liquid assets amounted to billion  unchanged from december  this represents and of earning assets  and and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
on the liability side  the primary source of funds available to meet liquidity needs is valley s core deposit base  which generally excludes certificates of deposit over thousand 
core deposits averaged approximately billion and billion for the year ended december  and  respectively  representing and of average earning assets 
short term borrowings through federal funds lines and federal home loan bank advances and large dollar certificates of deposit  generally those over thousand  are used as supplemental funding sources 
as of december   valley had outstanding advances of million with the fhlb 
additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan and investment payments of principal and interest  as well as prepayments received 
in proceeds from the sales of investment securities available for sale were million  and proceeds of million were generated from investment maturities 
purchases of investment securities in were million 
short term borrowings and certificates of deposit over thousand amounted to million and million  on average  for the year ending december  and  respectively 
during a substantial amount of loan growth was funded from maturities and normal payments of the investment portfolio 
deposit growth other than large certificates of deposit lagged behind loan growth 
valley anticipates using funds from the investment portfolio as well as deposit inflows to fund loan growth during the following table lists  by maturity  all certificates of deposit of  and over at december  these certificates of deposit are generated primarily from core deposit customers and are not brokered funds 
in thousands less than three months  three to six months  six to twelve months  more than twelve months  valley s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders 
this cash need is routinely satisfied by dividends collected from its subsidiary bank 
projected cash flows from this source are expected to be adequate to pay dividends  given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of its subsidiary

average yields are calculated on a yield to maturity basis 
average yields on obligations of states and political subdivisions are generally tax exempt and calculated on a tax equivalent basis using a statutory federal income tax rate of 
excludes equity securities which have indefinite maturities 
valley s investment portfolio is comprised of us government and federal agency securities  tax exempt issues of states and municipalities  mortgage backed securities  equity and other securities 
there were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding of shareholders equity  except for securities issued by the united states and its political subdivisions and agencies 
the portfolio generates substantial cash flow 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of long and short term economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment and other statement of financial condition components 
at december   valley had million of mortgaged backed securities classified as held to maturity and million of mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale 
substantially all the mortgage backed securities held by valley are issued or backed by federal agencies 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio is a source of significant liquidity to valley through the monthly cash flow of principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities  like all securities  are sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment  increasing and decreasing in value as interest rates fall and rise 
as interest rates fall  the increase in prepayments can reduce the yield on the mortgage backed securities portfolio  and reinvestment of the proceeds will be at lower interest rates 
included in the mortgage backed securities portfolio at december  were million of collateralized mortgage obligations cmo of which million were privately issued 
cmo s had a yield of and an unrealized gain of thousand at december  substantially all of the cmo portfolio was classified as available for sale 
as of december   valley had billion of securities available for sale compared with million at december  those securities are recorded at their fair value on an aggregate basis 
as of december   the investment securities available for sale had an unrealized gain of million  net of deferred taxes  compared to an unrealized gain of thousand  net of deferred taxes  at december  this change was primarily due to an increase in prices resulting from a decreasing interest rate environment 
these securities are not considered trading account securities  which may be sold on a continuous basis  but rather are securities which may be sold to meet the various liquidity and interest rate requirements of valley 
in connection with the midland acquisition  valley reassessed the classification of securities held in the midland portfolio and transferred million of securities held to maturity to securities available for sale to conform with valley s investment objectives

it is not known if the trend of increased lending will continue 
the commercial mortgage loans portfolio has continued its steady increase 
valley targets small to medium size businesses within the market area of the bank for this type of lending 
during the second quarter of  valley announced and began issuing a co branded credit card  the shoprite mastercard 
of the million of credit card loans outstanding at december   approximately million were the result of this co branded credit card program 
automobile loans comprised of total loans at december  automobile loans increased during as a result of increased loan demand and market penetration 
approximately of the automobile loan portfolio and of the total loan portfolio at december  represented loans originated by vnb through a program with a major insurance company 
these loans are subject to valley s underwriting criteria 
during the fourth quarter of  valley began closing loans in florida under this program 
valley began an identical program in the state of pennsylvania in january the addition of florida and pennsylvania results in an increase of in excess of of the number of agents under this program 
this will expand valley s year relationship with the company to states from maine to florida  as well as canada 
vnb extended this program during the first quarter of by establishing a finance company in toronto  canada to make auto loans 
this canadian subsidiary had interest income of approximately million for the year ended december   and auto loans of million at december  these loans are funded by a capital investment by vnb of million  with additional funding requirements satisfied by bank lines of credit 
any foreign exchange risk is limited to the capital investment by vnb since operations of this subsidiary are in canadian dollars 
much of valley s lending is in northern new jersey  with the exception of the out of state auto lending program 
however  efforts are made to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a downward turn in any one economic sector

total commercial fixed rate     commercial adjustable rate     real estate construction fixed rate   real estate construction adjustable rate    prior to maturity of each loan with a balloon payment and if the borrower requests an extension  valley generally conducts a review which normally includes an analysis of the borrower s financial condition and  if applicable  a review of the adequacy of collateral 
a rollover of the loan at maturity may require a principal paydown 
vnb is a preferred us small business administration sba lender with authority to make loans without the prior approval of the sba 
vnb currently has approval to make sba loans in new jersey  pennsylvania  new york  delaware and maryland 
between and of each loan is guaranteed by the sba and may be sold into the secondary market  with the balance retained in vnb s portfolio 
vnb intends to continue expanding this area of lending because it provides a solid source of fee income and loans with floating interest rates tied to the prime lending rate 
during  vnb originated approximately million of sba loans and sold million 
at december   million of sba loans were held in vnb s portfolio and vnb serviced approximately million of sba loans 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
loans are generally placed on a non accrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest 
exceptions to the non accrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection 
oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate 
oreo is reported at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of acquisition and at the lower of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  or cost thereafter 
non performing assets continued to decrease  and totaled million at december   compared with million at december   a decrease of million or 
non performing assets at december  and  respectively  amounted to and of loans and oreo 
loans days or more past due and not included in the non performing category totaled million at december   compared to million at december  these loans are primarily residential mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans which are generally well secured and in the process of collection 
also included are matured commercial mortgage loans in the process of being renewed  which totaled million and thousand at december  and december   respectively 
the following table sets forth non performing assets and accruing loans which were days or more past due as to principal or interest payments on the dates indicated  in conjunction with asset quality ratios for valley

as part of the analysis of the loan portfolio by management  it has been determined that there are approximately million in potential problem loans at december   which have not been classified as non accrual  past due or restructured 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in a nonperforming loan 
approximately thousand has been provided for in the allowance for loan losses for these potential problem loans 
there can be no assurance that valley has identified all of its problem loans 
at december   valley had identified approximately million of potential problem loans which were not classified as non accrual  past due or restructured 
asset quality and risk elements lending is one of the most important functions performed by valley and  by its very nature  lending is also the most complicated  risky and profitable part of valley s business 
for commercial loans  construction loans and commercial mortgage loans  a separate credit department is responsible for risk assessment  credit file maintenance and periodically evaluating overall creditworthiness of a borrower 
additionally  efforts are made to limit concentrations of credit so as to minimize the impact of a downturn in any one economic sector 
these loans are diversified as to type of borrower and loan 
however  most of these loans are in northern new jersey  presenting a geographical and credit risk if there was a significant downturn of the economy within the region 
residential mortgage loans are secured primarily by family properties located mainly within northern new jersey 
conservative underwriting policies are adhered to and loan to value ratios are generally less than percent 
consumer loans are comprised of home equity loans  credit card loans and automobile loans 
home equity and automobile loans are secured loans and are made based on an evaluation of the collateral and the borrower s creditworthiness 
those automobile loans are originated through a program with a major insurance company  whose customer base generally has a good credit profile and generally result in lower delinquencies and charge offs than that typically experienced from traditional sources 
these automobile loans are from states  including new jersey and generally present no more risk than those made within new jersey 
all loans are subject to valley s underwriting criteria 
and therefore  each loan or group of loans presents a geographical risk and credit risk based upon the economy of the region 
the co branded credit card portfolio was substantially generated through a pre approved mailing to shop rite s existing customer base during utilizing automated credit scoring techniques and additional underwriting standards 
management realizes that some degree of risk must be expected in the normal course of lending activities 
reserves are maintained to absorb such potential loan and off balance sheet credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses and related provision are an expression of management s evaluation of the credit portfolio and economic climate 
the following table sets forth the relationship among loans  loans charged off and loan recoveries  the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses for the past five years years ended december  in thousands average loans outstanding      beginning balance allowance for loan losses      balance from acquisition  loans charged off commercial     construction  mortgage commercial   mortgage residential consumer      charged off loans recovered commercial   construction mortgage commercial mortgage residential consumer     net charge offs      provision charged to operations      ending balance allowance for loan losses      ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level estimated necessary to absorb the potential loan losses and other credit risk related charge offs 
it is the result of an analysis which relates outstanding balances to expected reserve levels required to absorb future credit losses 
current economic problems are addressed through management s assessment of anticipated changes in the regional economic climate  changes in composition and volume of the loan portfolio and variances in levels of classified loans  non performing assets and other past due amounts 
additional factors include consideration of exposure to loss including size of credit  existence and nature of collateral  credit record  profitability and general economic conditions 
the underwriting  growth and delinquency experience in the credit card portfolio will substantially influence the level of allowance needed to absorb future losses 
although credit card loans are generally considered more risky than other types of lending  a higher interest rate is charged to compensate for this increased risk 
vnb will continue to closely monitor the need for additions to the allowance 
during  continued emphasis was placed on the current economic climate and the condition of the real estate market in the northern new jersey area 
management addressed these economic conditions and applied that information to changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the increase in net charge offs  among other things  was responsible for the decision to increase the provision to million in compared to million in the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for the past five years years ended december  percent percent percent of loan of loan of loan category category category allowance to total allowance to total allowance to total allocation loans allocation loans allocation loans loan category commercial    mortgage    consumer    unallocated  n a  n a  n a years ended december  percent percent of loan of loan category category allowance to total allowance to total allocation loans allocation loans loan category commercial   mortgage   consumer   unallocated  n a  n a at december  the allowance for loan losses amounted to million or of loans  net of unearned income  as compared to million or at year end the allowance is adjusted by provisions charged against income and loans charged off  net of recoveries 
net loan charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased to for compared with for net charge offs during were higher than due to the charge off of a large commercial credit  fewer recoveries during than in and a greater amount of consumer loan charge offs  many resulting from a rise in consumer bankruptcies 
while consumer loan charge offs increased during  they were at a level less than the level reported throughout the industry on a national basis 
non performing loans and loans past due days and still accruing in were greater than during the impaired loan portfolio is primarily collateral dependent as defined under sfas impaired loans and their related specific and general allocations to the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the average balance of impaired loans during and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during both and was million 
capital adequacy a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its shareholders equity  which should expand in close proportion to asset growth 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million or of total assets  compared with million or at year end valley has achieved steady internal capital generation throughout the past five years 
during  valley s board of directors rescinded its previously announced repurchase program after  shares of valley common stock were repurchased in and  shares were repurchased in during the three year period ended december   valley had reissued  shares for a stock dividend issued may   an expired warrant program and its employee benefit program 
in january valley s board of directors announced it had authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market rates 
reacquired shares are expected to be held in treasury to be used for employee benefit programs 
included in shareholders equity at december  was a million unrealized gain on investment securities available for sale  net of tax  compared to an unrealized gain of thousand at december  risk based guidelines define a two tier capital framework 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity less disallowed intangibles  while total risk based capital consists of tier capital and the allowance for loan losses up to of risk adjusted assets 
risk adjusted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk to different categories of assets and off balance sheet activities 
valley s capital position at december  under risk based capital guidelines was million  or of risk weighted assets  for tier capital and million  or for total risked based capital
