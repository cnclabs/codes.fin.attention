prior to july   the company historically operated as part of daka international 
these historical consolidated financial statements include the assets  liabilities  income and expenses that were directly related to the restaurant business as it was operated within daka international prior to the spin off 
the company s statement of operations includes all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and includes an allocation of certain general corporate expenses  including costs for corporate logistics  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
these allocations of general corporate expenses were based on a number of factors including  for example  personnel  labor costs and sales volumes 
management believes these allocations as well as the assumptions underlying the preparation of the company s separate consolidated financial statements to be reasonable 
certain other non restaurant operating assets and liabilities of daka international were contributed to the company as described in note to financial statements 
those assets and liabilities consisting of notes receivable  property  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and contingent liabilities have been recorded within their respective captions during fiscal and resulted in a decrease to stockholders equity of million

results of operations overview the company incurred an operating loss before income tax benefit and minority interests of million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to a comparable operating loss of million last year 
included in the loss before income tax benefit and minority interest for fiscal were impairment  exit and other charges of million 
exclusive of these expense charges  the company would have reported a net loss of million for fiscal as discussed further below  results for the current fiscal year include a net gain of million on the sale of a champps restaurant 
while the company believes it has strategies that will give it the best opportunity to return to overall profitability  there can be no assurance that such strategies will be implemented within the anticipated time frame or at all  or if implemented  will be successful 
accordingly  the company may continue to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years 
the amount of net operating losses and the time required by the company to reach sustained profitability are highly uncertain and to achieve profitability the company must  among other things  successfully reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from historical levels while continuing to increase net revenues from its existing and continuing restaurants and successfully execute its growth strategy for the champps americana restaurant chain 
while progress has been made in the current fiscal year in many of these areas  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability at all or on a sustained basis 
on september   the company announced it had retained bear stearns co  inc to assist the company s board of directors the board in evaluating and seeking financial and strategic alternatives  including a possible sale of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will pursue a sale or any other specific alternative or that it will be able to reach any agreement or complete any transaction that it may undertake 
the company s champps americana restaurant chain is in the expansion phase 
the timing of revenues and expenses associated with the opening of new restaurants or the closing or repositioning of existing restaurants are expected to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly results 
in addition  the company s results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional or local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect the company 
among other factors  the success of the company s business and its operating results are dependent upon its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and liquor costs and  particularly for champps americana restaurants  the mix between food and liquor revenues 
various factors beyond the company s control  such as adverse weather changes  may affect food costs and increases in federal  state and local taxes may affect liquor costs 
while in the past fuddruckers and champps have been able to manage their exposure to the risk of increasing food and liquor costs through certain purchasing practices  menu changes and price adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that changes in its sales mix or its overall buying power will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in recent periods the company s fuddruckers restaurant chain has experienced operational difficulties which have impacted its profitability 
the company also believes certain of its fuddruckers locations opened in fiscal  and have underperformed principally due to poor real estate selection and  in certain new markets  consumer confusion over the fuddruckers core concept of the world s greatest hamburger 
the company believes such consumer confusion was due in part to design changes to its restaurants opened in the last three fiscal years which de emphasized the butcher shop and bakery which  the company believes  resulted in new customers not realizing the quality of the ingredients and freshness of the products used in making its sandwiches and other menu items when compared with its competitors 
the company believes it has addressed these issues for future fuddruckers locations  although no company fuddruckers restaurants are presently planned to open in fiscal as discussed further below and under the caption the proposed fuddruckers transaction  the company has decided to sell its fuddruckers business in a transaction expected to close in november  notwithstanding these risks  the company believes that its near term strategies  including  but not limited to  continued expansion of champps  improving operational excellence  and anticipated continued lower general and administrative expenses from historical levels resulting from actions taken since june  and the effects of the spin off  the proposed fuddruckers transaction  and other related transactions  should provide it with the best opportunity for improved overall profitability 
overall results of operations revenues grew million  or  to million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in revenues  as more fully explained in the segment discussion which follows  resulted from increases in champps revenues offset  in part  by decreases in fuddruckers and specialty concepts revenues 
cost of sales and operating expenses were essentially unchanged on a consolidated basis at of restaurant sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal however  each segment s results are separately discussed below 
the company recorded impairment  exit and other costs of million in fiscal  and million in fiscal included in the fiscal amounts were million related to the write off of net assets and exit costs of the great bagel coffee business  million related to impairment of fuddruckers assets  million related to the company s put call agreement with respect to a minority interest in fuddruckers restaurants  and exit costs of million associated with closing two fuddruckers restaurants and impairment charges of million on fuddruckers stores sold to a franchisee at year end 
the company expects to incur additional expenses aggregating million in connection with the proposed fuddruckers transaction which will be incurred and recorded during the first and second quarter of fiscal the company estimates that approximately million of these impairment  exit and other costs represent future cash outlays 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made decisions to close its non traditional specialty concepts segment restaurants and to close or refranchise certain underperforming fuddruckers restaurants which resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million 
included in these costs were charges for impairment to the carrying value of assets closed or refranchised during fiscal  reacquired franchise rights  lease termination fees and other exit costs  including severance costs  associated with the restaurants to be closed 
in fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  which resulted in a pretax charge of approximately million in the provision included charges for impairments to the carrying value of certain restaurant assets  reacquired franchise rights  investments and certain other assets

such amortization expense totaled million in and was included in depreciation and amortization 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  sales in champps owned restaurants increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million in the increase primarily reflected six new champps owned restaurants during opened for all of  three new champps owned restaurants opened in  and higher per restaurant average sales volumes

this decrease reflects the impact of the company closing eight units in fiscal pursuant to previously announced plans offset  in part  by an increase in same store sales of 
restaurant unit contribution  excluding impairment  exit and other charges  was in fiscal compared with in fiscal this improvement reflects lower labor costs and product costs offset  in part  by higher discounts and coupons associated with the company s kids eat free everyday promotion from january  to memorial day in fiscal  and its subsequent promotion  kids eat for 
everyday  introduced after memorial day 
depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal were lower at of sales compared with last year and reflect the impact of insignificant amortization of preopening costs in the current year compared with million a year ago  and closure of certain restaurants in franchising and royalty income decreased approximately million for fiscal during fiscal  the company did not execute any international multi unit development agreements 
royalty income from domestic franchised restaurants remained consistent for fiscal compared to the previous year 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  sales from fuddruckers owned restaurants increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal this increase reflects the addition of six new fuddruckers owned restaurants during fiscal and the impact of a full year of operations of restaurants opened in fiscal  offset by a decline in comparable restaurant sales 
restaurant unit contribution  excluding impairment  exit costs and other charges  decreased approximately million 
operating margins continued to be negatively impacted by poor sales levels  higher labor and other non food operating costs  and higher depreciation and amortization expenses offset  in part  by the impact of menu changes  a price increase effective in early december and improved product costs as a percentage of sales 
changes between years in labor costs  other non food operating expenses and depreciation and amortization expressed as a percent of sales reflect the impact of lower average sales which reduced the ability of the company to leverage these relatively fixed expenses 
franchising and royalty income decreased approximately million for fiscal during fiscal  the company did not execute any international multi unit development agreements 
royalty income from domestic franchised restaurants remained consistent for fiscal compared to specialty concepts on june   the company ceased the operations of its great bagel coffee business  which represented the sole remaining business of its former specialty concepts segment 
this decision resulted in a charge of million for exit costs associated with the termination of leases  severance and write downs of fixed assets abandoned 
specialty concepts has historically included the operations of the great bagel coffee company and the operations of certain non traditional foodservice venues such as restaurant operations conducted by the company in home depot locations under the names leo s delicatessen and fudd cafes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to terminate its non traditional restaurant operations leaving only the great bagel coffee business operating 
the specialty concepts segment generated restaurant sales of million in  million in  and million in selling  general and administrative expenses comparison of fiscal year ended june  and june  selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal this improvement relates primarily to head count and other reductions taken in coupled with the actual costs of maintaining the corporate overhead of the company when compared with the allocation of daka international s overhead estimated in fiscal as previously discussed 
the decrease in the current year also reflects lower marketing costs at fuddruckers during as compared to as the company s strategy in this segment in fiscal was to utilize the kid s meal promotion in lieu of marketing 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  and june  selling  general and administrative expenses  including a component of depreciation and amortization related to corporate assets of daka international allocated to the company  increased approximately million to million for fiscal this increase primarily reflects the impact of increased marketing efforts and costs for fuddruckers  higher overhead  including severance costs  associated with the specialty concepts segment and ongoing investment in corporate infrastructures 
amounts for also include establishment of legal and other reserves 
income taxes prior to july   the operations of the company were generally included in the consolidated us federal income tax return and certain combined and separate state and local tax returns of daka international 
a benefit in lieu of taxes for and has been presented as if the company was a separate taxpayer 
given the company s history of losses  no benefit for net operating losses were recognized in fiscal the company s effective tax benefit rate was approximately for  compared with an effective tax benefit rate of approximately for the comparable period of as of june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the carryforwards expire at various dates through and a portion of such carryforwards can only be applied against the taxable income of fuddruckers and a portion against the earnings of the company s owned subsidiary  atlantic restaurant ventures  inc accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

year compliance the company has an information technology steering committee the committee which has been given the assignment of evaluating year compliance for all of the company s primary and mission critical software and hardware assets core systems to correct or mitigate year compliance exposure 
based on the committee s review  the company has segregated its core systems into the following categories consolidated accounting and financial reporting  payroll  restaurant sales and accounting  data transmission  office support  and banking services 
except for banking services  the committee has completed its review of each of these categories and  as discussed further below  has identified several areas of non compliance including fuddruckers point of sale devices cash registers and payroll processing hardware and software as systems requiring upgrades and or replacement in order to be year compliant 
with respect to consolidated accounting and financial reporting core systems  the company utilizes nationally recognized systems such as oracle  windows  novell and xcellenet which are  or with readily available upgrades will be  year compliant 
the company estimates the costs to upgrade these systems are insignificant and its exposure to catastrophic year risk to be highly unlikely 
with respect to its payroll core systems  the company s version of ceridian software and the related hardware are year deficient 
ceridian and the company are working together to provide a solution and the company expects the solution to be in place by january  the company presently estimates the cost to bring its payroll core systems year compliant to be approximately  the payroll core system is important to the company s day to day operations 
a failure of the payroll core system will be mitigated  however  by the reduction in force that will occur after the proposed fuddruckers transaction closes 
the company believes that it could manage its payroll processes manually after the sale is completed 
the company s restaurant sales and accounting core systems are segregated between champps and fuddruckers 
the champps systems are year compliant 
the fuddruckers systems will require upgrades of hardware and software which are currently available and are estimated to cost approximately  however  pending the sale of fuddruckers  no action is planned at this time 
the company s data transmission and office support core systems are year compliant in all significant respects 
an analysis of the company s banking services core systems will be delayed until after the pending fuddruckers transaction is completed 
the company believes the size of the remaining business will greatly reduce any exposure in these core systems 
the company has not completed its evaluation of year compliance of its primary vendors for impact on the company 
however  the committee does not believe the company faces any significant exposure from any vendor year issues given the availability of inventory  the size and stature of its primary vendors  and the relatively low technology nature of its business 
financial condition and liquidity at june   the company had a working capital deficiency of million 
the working capital needs of companies engaged in the restaurant industry are generally low as sales are made for cash and inventory and labor costs and other operating expenses are generally paid on terms 
the company has been unable to obtain a line of credit with a bank during fiscal  although equipment lease financing was obtained and remains available for future construction projects  if necessary 
given the company s plans for the sale of its fuddruckers restaurant chain  and existing sources of financing through sale leaseback facilities  the company does not anticipate any significant need for working capital for its primary business over the next twelve months 
however  should the proposed fuddruckers transaction fail to close  the effect on the company s near term liquidity could be adversely affected 
nonetheless  the company believes its financial resources are sufficient to sustain operations through fiscal in the event that such resources are less than anticipated  the company has the ability to curtail its champps expansion program and further reduce non essential operating costs to conserve working capital 
further  the company believes that certain of its existing restaurant units can be used as collateral for obtaining loans and could provide working capital within a relatively short timeframe 
capital expenditures for restaurant expansion during fiscal were funded primarily through million of sale leaseback and equipment financing under existing facilities and million in cash contributions from operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
in december  champps obtained million of sale leaseback financing for the construction of new champps restaurants 
as of june   the construction of four champps restaurants had been fully funded under this commitment and two had been partially funded 
at june   million was available for use 
any unused commitment expires on december  during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company expects to incur million additional expenses related to the proposed fuddruckers transaction 
the company estimates that it will expend million in cash related to charges recorded during fiscal and the aforementioned additional expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of june   the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
the company s outstanding long term debt at june  bears interest at fixed rates  therefore  the company s results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the extent that variable rate short term notes payable are outstanding 
due to the short term nature and insignificant amount of the company s notes payable  an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
the company s put obligations related to an obligations to repurchase the remaining interest in atlantic restaurant ventures  inc arvi is subject to market risk if the historical operations of arvi improve 
based on historical trends and anticipated continued poor operational performance  the company believes that the likelihood of an increase to the minimum put obligation of million is not likely to occur
