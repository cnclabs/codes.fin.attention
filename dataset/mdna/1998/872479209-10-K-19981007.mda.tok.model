overview tii designs  manufactures and markets overvoltage surge protectors  network interface devices nids  station electronics and fiber optic products for use in the communications industry 
the company has been a leading supplier of overvoltage surge protectors to us telephone operating companies telcos for over years 
the company s results of operations were affected by several factors in the and fiscal years 
during the third quarter of fiscal  access network technologies ant  a joint venture between lucent technologies  inc lucent and raychem corporation raychem  was dissolved 
the company had entered into a strategic agreement with ant in to develop and manufacture advanced overvoltage surge protectors 
the products developed by the joint venture combined tii overvoltage surge protectors with a proprietary gel sealing technology from raychem that makes these products virtually impenetrable by weather 
following such dissolution  the company increased its allowance for the inventory that was produced for ant 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company put into effect certain measures to reduce costs 
these measures included a reduction of personnel  the movement of certain production processes to the company s lower cost facility in the dominican republic  the outsourcing of certain manufacturing steps  the realignment of the company s sales and marketing force and the discontinuance of certain lower margin products 
these actions resulted in non recurring charges of million million of which was charged to cost of sales   to selling  general and administrative expense and  to research and development expense in the third quarter of fiscal  consisting of an increase to the allowance for inventory primarily related to the ant joint venture product line approximately million  as well as severance related costs approximately  and costs to close or move certain production processes approximately 
the company and raychem agreed to continue to manufacture and market the products without the participation of lucent 
the company does not expect to incur any other charges as a result of the effects of the dissolution of the ant joint venture 
to meet its customers needs  the company introduced a line of broadband nids with features and functionality that the company believes were instrumental in its winning two major contracts in july and september of with an rboc and an independent telco  respectively  each of which was a pre existing unaffiliated customer 
for strategic purposes  the company accepted orders under one of these contracts which it believed it could fulfill under an aggressive delivery time schedule that mandated it to seek to accelerate production 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company incurred additional manufacturing expenses in gearing up toward the accelerated production of its new broadband nid product line  compounded  in the second quarter of fiscal  by production disruptions as the company sought to meet a customer s requested delivery schedules 
these additional manufacturing costs included the hiring of temporary personnel during the initial phases of production  the outsourcing of certain production processes  initial purchases of materials in smaller than usual quantities for which volume discounts were not available  lower initial manufacturing yields and additional freight and other expediting costs 
additionally  results were also adversely affected by continuing expenditures relating to the company s movement of certain production processes to the company s lower cost facility in the dominican republic 
the disruptions were primarily caused by the failure of certain vendors to  in turn  meet the company s delivery requirements for required molds and inventory components  production breakdowns which produced significant delays and yield losses during the initial production process and delays in completing the training of permanent employees for both the company s puerto rico and dominican republic facilities  as well as temporary manufacturing employees hired at its puerto rico facilities to meet the accelerated production schedule 
as a result  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company s net sales decreased to million compared to million in the comparable period in fiscal  its gross profit margin was  compared to million in the second quarter of fiscal and the company experienced a net loss of million compared to net income of  in the second quarter of fiscal 
while the company resolved most of the production disruption issues toward the end of the second quarter  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company continued to experience certain yield losses  costs associated with outsourcing the production of certain injection molded parts and added costs to air freight products to meet customer delivery requirements 
therefore  in fiscal and the company s gross profit percentage was below levels in effect prior to fiscal while the company expects sales and gross profit margins to increase from fiscal levels  the company does not anticipate that its gross profit margins will return to levels in effect prior to fiscal in the foreseeable future 
fiscal years ended june   june  and june  net sales for fiscal decreased by  or 
to million from million in fiscal the decline relates primarily to a decrease in product shipped due to the company s production disruptions in the second and  to a significantly lesser degree  third quarters of fiscal  partially offset by an increase in sales of its fiber optic product line 
net sales for fiscal increased by million or to million from million in fiscal the company experienced growth in its overvoltage surge protector  nid and fiber optic product lines 
as a result of increased freight costs  increased overtime  the hiring of additional temporary personnel  outsourcing certain production functions  lower initial manufacturing yields  and other expediting costs to meet customers desired delivery schedules  gross profit margins in fiscal were of net sales versus of net sales for fiscal before the non recurring million in fiscal charged to cost of sales related to the company s program to reduce costs and to an inventory charge due to the dissolution of ant discussed above in overview 
gross profit margins decreased for fiscal to before non recurring charges of million from for fiscal excluding the  shortfall payment received from at t corp 
during fiscal  the company s fiscal gross margin would have been 
the company s fiscal gross profit margin was impacted by higher raw material and manufacturing costs and  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  by costs associated with the accelerated production startup of several new products  including the company s new broadband nids  and expenditures relating to the movement of certain production processes to the company s lower cost facility in the dominican republic 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million or to million  or of sales  from million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from legal  accounting  printing and other expenses incurred in connection with a withdrawn public offering of common stock in the second quarter of fiscal and additional personnel  promotion and other costs associated with the company s efforts to obtain and fulfill new sales contracts 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  during fiscal year the increase resulted primarily from legal costs of an action in which the company was a plaintiff and from personnel  promotion and other costs associated with the company s increased efforts to win supply contracts for its new broadband nid product line 
absent the  non recurring charge in the third quarter of fiscal  research and development expenses for fiscal increased by  or to million  due primarily to higher costs associated with product development for the expansion of the company s broadband nid product line 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased by  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase relates to  of non recurring charges in fiscal and costs associated with the development of the broadband nid product line and new overvoltage surge protectors 
interest expense in fiscal was  lower than in fiscal interest expense in fiscal included amortization of debt origination costs that ceased during the first quarter of fiscal interest expense for fiscal declined by  to  from  in fiscal due to reduced debt levels and the absence of amortization of debt origination costs that ceased in the first quarter of fiscal the company accrued a tax provision for fiscal for the settlement of an audit performed by the internal revenue service  resulting in a net provision of  for the year 
income taxes due to its election to operate under section of the internal revenue code and the availability of certain net operating loss carryforwards and exemptions from income taxes in puerto rico and in the dominican republic  the company has not been required to pay any united states federal  puerto rico or dominican republic taxes on most of its income 
the company calculates its section credit utilizing the economic activity based credit 
based on fiscal levels of qualified wages  fringe benefits and depreciation in puerto rico  the company s economic activity based credit limitation is approximately  per annum 
although the section credit has generally been repealed  the company continues to be eligible to claim a section credit until the year ended june under a special grandfather rule subject to limitation calculated to be  of taxable income 
if  however  the company adds a substantial new line of business or has a new line of business that becomes substantial  it would cease to be eligible to claim the section credit beginning with the taxable year in which such new line of business is added 
based on the company s current level of possession income and business plans  the company believes that it will be eligible to claim a section credit under the grandfather rule discussed above

the credit facility enables the company to have up to million of revolving credit loans outstanding at any one time  limited by a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  subject to certain reserves 
in addition  the company may also borrow up to million  limited by a borrowing base not exceeding of the purchase price of new equipment or the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment already owned 
any portion of the aggregate million commitment for capital expenditure loans not borrowed by december  will then be extinguished 
subject to extension in certain instances  the scheduled maturity date of revolving credit loans is april   while capital expenditure loans are to be repaid through march   subject to mandatory repayments from disposition proceeds and insurance proceeds in certain circumstances

as of june   the company s tangible net worth as defined was approximately million 
the company believes it incurred operating losses during the quarter ended september  if the operating losses were to continue  or events occurred causing additional losses  the company may cease to be in compliance with this convenant 
if the company is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of this provision  it may be unable to borrow under  and the lender would be able to accelerate payment of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
management believes  however  that the company would be able to secure alternate sources of financing 
the company s ability to obtain such financing will be affected by such factors as its results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and restrictions contained in credit facilities 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to  or the terms on which it may be able to  obtain any such financing 
impact of inflation the company does not believe its business is affected by inflation to a greater extent than the general economy 
the company monitors the impact of inflation and attempts to adjust prices where market conditions permit 
inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations during any of the reported periods 
year in fiscal the company commenced  and in fiscal  continued a program to assess and address in a timely manner all its information systems  including customer service  production  distribution and financial systems in conjunction with the year a significant portion of the company s year program has been implemented as part of its program to upgrade its information systems  which the company had committed to do regardless of the year issue 
in addition  the company was assesed the impact of the year on non information technology systems 
the company has spent approximately  on computer hardware  software and related support for this information systems upgrade program and expects to spend approximately  complete its year compliance program 
if it becomes necessary to dedicate additional financial and other resources to complete the company s information systems upgrade program and to complete the conversion of non information technology equipment to year compliant by the end of fiscal year the company s estimated year program completion date  of shortly thereafter  the company will do so 
the company is also communicating with its suppliers  customers  distributors  and others with whom it conducts business to coordinate year compliance and to identify alternative sources of supply for materials if necessary 
the implementation of these plans is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company 
the company presently believes alternative sources of supply will be available in the event of unforeseen year compliance issues that affect suppliers abilities to fulfill requirements 
if production and other plans need to be modified because of unforeseen year issues at vendors  distributors and others with whom the company conducts business  the company will do so when the need for such modification becomes apparent 
if the company or its suppliers  distributors or others with whom it conducts business are unable to identify and address the system issues related to the year risk on a timely basis  there could be a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity and financial condition
