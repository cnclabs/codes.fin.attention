overview the company commenced operations in and provides a suite of products application developers use to build and deploy business applications in a cost effective manner 
centura products include an embedded database that scales from smart cards to the web  and object oriented application development tools 
centura products are designed to be deployed in both thin and fat client environments  using business logic objects that can be reused in multi tier architectures in distributed environments 
the company s product lines include an embedded database  sqlbase  application development tools  centura team developer  the bit version of sqlwindows  and centura net 
db and pc to mainframe connectivity products sqlhost 
these products are expected to constitute the majority of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot accurately predict the exact timing of new product releases or enhancements 
any failure to deliver products as scheduled  or such products failure to achieve early market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company

the company has experienced in the past and may in the future continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company reported a loss of million for fiscal year  a profit of million for  and a loss of million for beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company refocused and restructured its operations to leverage its core technological competencies into next generation products  which include embeddable databases and continue to embrace object oriented application development and both thin and fat client environments 
with the addition of centura net 
db  the company s products now provide a comprehensive architecture for the development and deployment of information systems and applications from a host environment  through two tier client server and sql databases  to the multi tier environment of the world wide web 
the company recognized total restructuring charges of million in and approximately million in there can be no assurance that the restructuring efforts the company has engaged in to date will be successful or that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
many of the company s product licensing arrangements are subject to revenue recognition on a per unit deployed basis as the company s deferred obligation to its customers is gradually extinguished 
revenue recognition in such cases is therefore dependent upon the business activities of the company s customers and the timely and accurate reporting of such activities to the company  which makes predictability of the related revenue extremely uncertain 
although the company has operated historically with little or no backlog of traditional boxed product shipments  it has experienced a seasonal pattern of product revenue decline between the fourth quarter and the succeeding first quarter  contributing to lower worldwide product revenues and operating results during such quarters 
it has generally realized lower european product revenues in the third quarter as compared to the rest of the year 
the company has also experienced a pattern of recording a substantial portion of its revenues in the third month of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are dependent on orders booked in the last month 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales of the company s products in relation to the company s expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that the company s expenses exceed expected revenues in any fiscal period  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that the company s operating results may  during any fiscal period  fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors

other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is comprised of interest income  interest expense and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company s gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have fluctuated from period to period  primarily as a result of fluctuating values of the us dollar and instability in european and latin american currency markets 
the company recorded a foreign currency loss of approximately million in  principally due to the decline in the value of certain european currencies in the first quarter of the company recorded a foreign currency gain of million in and a loss of million in the company expanded its hedging program in the second half of in an effort to hedge up to a targeted of its exposure to foreign currency fluctuation 
the costs of currency hedging are reflected in the reported gains and losses of foreign currency transactions 
the company anticipates that it will continue the hedging program in nonetheless  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could result in losses from foreign currency transactions 
the company s net interest expense was million in and million in and the company had net interest income of million in the decrease in interest income and the increase in interest expense over these periods is due principally to the decrease in cash available for investment 
sales of the company s products are denominated both in local currencies of the respective geographic region and in us dollars  depending upon the economic stability of that region and locally accepted business practices 
accordingly  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies in these markets may negatively impact revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
an increase in the relative value of the us dollar would serve to increase the relative foreign currency cost to the customer of a us dollar denominated purchase  which may negatively affect the company s sales in those markets 
the us dollar value of a sale denominated in a region s local currency decreases in proportion to relative increases in the value of the us dollar

year issue 
the company has commenced  for all of its information systems  a year date conversion project to address all necessary code changes  testing and implementation of mission critical applications 
the year issue arises because most computer systems and programs were designed to handle only a two digit year  as opposed to a four digit year 
when the year begins these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its internal computer systems and from third parties with which the company interacts 
such failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business  and to process and account for the transfer of funds electronically

interest on the note is calculated based on the one month libor plus and was payable quarterly 
at the company s option interest payments could be deferred until the principal was due 
pursuant to the ca agreement  the ability of the company to convert the note to common stock required the company to maintain a minimum market capitalization of million commencing on and including november   and continuing through the duration of the note the minimum market capitalization requirement 
if the company did not meet the minimum market capitalization requirement  the company would lose the option to convert the note into common stock  and all outstanding principal and interest would be due and payable on march  at december  the company had approximately million in unsecured foreign currency contracts  denominated in various european currencies  as part of a program to hedge the financial exposure arising from foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the deferred product and support revenue of million at december  reflects a delay in recognition of revenue in accordance with contractual agreements and requires minimal resources of the company 
net cash used by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the use of cash in was due principally to decreases in deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by depreciation and amortization and decreases in accounts receivable 
in  net income and increases in depreciation and amortization in were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  litigation expense and deferred revenue 
in  increases in accrued litigation  depreciation and amortization  adjustments for capitalized software  deferred revenue  and provision for sales returns and allowances were offset by the net loss and the increase to accounts receivable 
inventories  which were located at the company s third party turnkey vendor  decreased by million in this decrease in was due in part to planned reductions of inventories and a consolidation of worldwide inventories into a single third party vendor location 
cash used in investing activities was million in  principally due to the purchase of equipment and capitalized software costs  partially offset by maturities of investments 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  principally due to maturities of investments offset by acquisition of property and equipment  and capitalization of software development costs 
cash used in investing activities of million in was utilized for additions in the amount of million of internally developed and purchased software and million in additions to property and equipment  primarily computer and other capital equipment  partially offset by the sale of million of short term investments  net of purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities in and totaled million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of proceeds from short term borrowings and issuance of common stock offset by repayment of the notes payable 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million primarily as a result of the million subordinated convertible debt financing by ca 
the company believes that expected cash flows from operations and existing cash balances  will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
the company may  however  choose to raise cash for operational or other needs sometime in the future 
if the company needs further financing  there can be no assurance that it will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any additional equity financing will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company s capital requirements also may be affected by acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to the company s business  which the company considers from time to time 
the company regularly evaluates such opportunities 
any such transaction  if consummated  may further reduce the company s working capital or require the issuance of equity 
in january  the company entered into a million asset based loan facility with coast business credit 
the loan provides for borrowings of up to million  secured by the company s accounts receivable  combined with a million capital equipment facility 
the facility bears interest at a rate of above the bank of america reference rate  and provides for the ability to reduce interest costs based on the achievement of certain financial covenants 
the facility matures in january and provides for the ability to extend the agreement for one year at the option of the company 
the facility replaces the pacific business funding corporation accounts receivable factoring agreement entered into by the company in june factors that may affect future results the company has experienced in the past and expects in the future to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has at times recognized a substantial portion of its net revenues in the last month or last few weeks of a quarter 
the company generally ships products as orders are received and  therefore  has little or no backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on a number of factors that are difficult to forecast  including  among others  the volume and timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter 
operating results also may fluctuate due to factors such as demand for the company s products  introduction  localization or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  reviews in the industry press concerning the products of the company or its competitors  changes or anticipated changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  mix of products sold  returns from the company s distributors and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
in addition  because the company s staffing and other operating expenses are based in part on anticipated net revenues  a substantial portion of which may not be generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt or shipment of orders and ability to achieve anticipated revenue levels can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales of the company s products in relation to the company s expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently intends to increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of sales and marketing operations and expand distribution channels 
to the extent that such expenses proceed or are not subsequently followed by increased net revenues  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in the future  the company may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing acquired businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively complete or integrate acquisitions  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as of the date hereof  the company has no understanding or agreement with any other entity regarding any potential acquisition or combination  the consummation of which is probable 
in addition  quarterly operating results of the company will depend on a number of other factors that are difficult to forecast  including factors listed in item business  risk factors recent company losses  fluctuations in quarterly results
