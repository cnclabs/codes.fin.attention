the increase was driven by increased write downs related to domestic theatrical live action releases and an increase in production costs for theatrical and television product  as well as an increase in the number of shows produced for network television and syndication 
production cost increases are reflective of industry trends as competition for creative talent has increased  costs within the industry have increased at a rate significantly above inflation 
cost and expense increases were also due to increased activity related to internet start up businesses 
in addition  current year costs and expenses reflected charges totaling million related to strategic downsizing in the company s consumer product business  particularly in response to asian economic difficulties  and consolidation of certain studio operations in its filmed entertainment business

the contract provides for total payments of approximately billion over an eight year period  commencing with the season 
the programming rights fees under the new contract are significantly higher than those required by the previous contract and the fee increases exceed the estimated revenue increases over the contract term 
the higher fees under the new contract reflect various factors  including increased competition for sports programming rights and an increase in the number of games to be broadcast by espn 
the company is pursuing a variety of strategies  including marketing efforts  to reduce the impact of the higher costs 
the contract s impact on the company s results over the remaining contract term is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences 
the cost of the nfl contract is charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly and accordingly  they are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted if necessary 
such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods

theme parks and resorts vs 
revenues increased or million to billion  driven by growth at the walt disney world resort  reflecting contributions of million  from increased guest spending and record attendance  growth of million from higher occupied room nights and million from disney cruise line 
higher guest spending reflected strong per capita spending  due in part to new food  beverage and merchandise offerings throughout the resort  and higher average room rates 
increased occupied room nights reflected additional capacity resulting from the opening of disney s coronado springs resort in august record theme park attendance resulted from growth in domestic and international tourist visitation due to the opening of the new theme park  disney s animal kingdom 
disneyland s revenues for the year increased slightly as higher guest spending was largely offset by reduced attendance driven primarily by difficult comparisons to the prior year s main street electrical parade farewell season and construction of new tomorrowland in the first half of operating income increased or million to billion  resulting primarily from higher guest spending  increased occupied room nights and record attendance at the walt disney world resort  partially offset by start up and operating costs associated with disney s animal kingdom and disney cruise line

increased operating costs were associated with growth in theme park attendance and occupied rooms  higher guest spending and increased marketing and sales expenses primarily associated with walt disney world resort s th anniversary celebration 
additional cost increases resulted from theme park and resort expansions including disney s animal kingdom and disney cruise line  which both began operations in liquidity and capital resources the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating and discretionary spending requirements 
cash provided by operations was comparable to the prior year  at billion 
in  the company invested billion to develop and produce film and television properties and billion to design and develop new theme park attractions  resort properties  real estate developments and other properties 
investments totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the million increase in investment in film and television properties was primarily driven by higher live action and animation spending 
live action production spending was driven by increases at miramax and higher animation spending reflected an increase in the number of films in production 
the million increase in investment in theme parks  resorts and other properties resulted primarily from initiatives including disney s california adventure and disney cruise line

the company s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows and access to capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
other matters year the yk problem 
the company is devoting significant resources throughout its business operations to minimize the risk of potential disruption from the year yk problem 
this problem is a result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any information technology it systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the problem also extends to many non it systems  that is  operating and control systems that rely on embedded chip systems 
in addition  like every other business enterprise  the company is at risk from yk failures on the part of its major business counterparts  including suppliers  distributors  licensees and manufacturers  as well as potential failures in public and private infrastructure services  including electricity  water  gas  transportation and communications 
system failures resulting from the yk problem could adversely affect operations and financial results in all of the company s business segments 
failures may affect security  payroll operations or employee and guest health and safety  as well as such routine but important operations as billing and collection 
in addition  the company s business segments face more specific risks 
for example the company s theme parks and resorts operations could be significantly impeded by failures in hotel and cruise line reservation and operating systems  in theme park operating systems  including those controlling individual rides  attractions  parades and shows  and in security  health and safety systems 
in the creative content segment  yk failures could interfere with critical systems in such areas as the production  duplication and distribution of motion picture and home video product and the ordering  distribution and sale of merchandise at the company s retail stores and catalog operations 
in the broadcasting segment  at risk operations include satellite transmission and communication systems 
yk failures in such systems could adversely affect the company s television and radio networks  including cable services  as well as its owned and operated stations 
addressing the problem 
the company has developed a six phase approach to resolving the yk issues that are reasonably within its control 
all of these efforts are being coordinated through a senior level task force chaired by the company s chief information officer cio  as well as individual task forces in each major business unit 
as of september   approximately employees were devoting more than half of their time to yk efforts  in addition to approximately expert consultants retained on a full time basis to assist with specific potential problems 
the cio reports periodically to the audit review committee of the board of directors with respect to the company s yk efforts 
the company s approach to and the anticipated timing of each phase are described below 
phase inventory 
the first phase entails a worldwide inventory of all hardware and software including business and operational applications  operating systems and third party products that may be at risk  and identification of key third party businesses whose yk failures might most significantly impact the company 
the it system inventory process has been completed  and the inventories of key third party businesses and of internal non it systems are expected to be completed by december  phase assessment 
once each at risk system has been identified  the yk task forces assess how critical the system is to business operations and the potential impact of failure  in order to establish priorities for repair or replacement 
systems are classified as critical  important or non critical 
a critical system is one that  if not operational  would cause the shutdown of all or a portion of a business unit within two weeks  while an important system is one that would cause such a shutdown within two months 
this process has been completed for all it systems  resulting in the identification of nearly business systems that are critical to continued functioning and more than  that are either important or are otherwise being monitored 
the assessment process for internal non it systems and for key third party businesses is expected to be completed by mid systems that are known to be critical or important are receiving top priority in assessment and remediation 
phase strategy 
this phase involves the development of appropriate remedial strategies for both it and non it systems 
these strategies may include repairing  testing and certifying  replacing or abandoning particular systems as discussed under phases and below 
selection of appropriate strategies is based upon such factors as the assessments made in phase  the type of system  the availability of a yk compliant replacement and cost 
the strategy phase has been completed for all it systems 
for some non it embedded systems  strategy development is continuing 
at the company s theme parks  the majority of ride and show control systems have been tested and certified 
a strategy for addressing embedded systems in office buildings is being developed in concert with building managers and systems vendors and should be completed by spring the process of analysis  certification or replacement or workaround for embedded systems in office buildings is expected to consume the first half of strategies for other embedded systems  such as satellite communications systems  are being developed and are also expected to be complete by mid phase remediation 
the remediation phase involves creating detailed project plans  marshalling necessary resources and executing the strategies chosen 
for it systems  this phase is approximately complete for critical and important systems  and is expected to be completed including certification by july  for non critical systems  most corrections are expected to be completed by december  for those systems that are not expected to be reliably functional after january   detailed manual workaround plans will be developed prior to the end of phase testing and certification 
this phase includes establishing a test environment  performing systems testing with third parties if necessary  and certifying the results 
the certification process entails having functional experts review test results  computer screens and printouts against pre established criteria to ensure system compliance 
the company expects all critical and important it systems to be certified by july  testing for non it systems has been initiated  however  due to the company s reliance on many third party vendors for these systems  the company cannot estimate precisely when this phase will be completed 
the majority of embedded systems at the company s theme parks are expected to be certified by december  the company s target for all critical and important non it systems is july the company has initiated written and telephonic communications with key third party businesses  as well as public and private providers of infrastructure services  to ascertain and evaluate their efforts in addressing yk compliance 
it is anticipated that the majority of testing and certification with these entities will occur in phase contingency planning 
this phase involves addressing any remaining open issues expected in and early as a precautionary measure  the company is currently developing contingency plans for all systems that are not expected to be yk compliant by march a variety of automated as well as manual fallback plans are under consideration  including the use of electronic spreadsheets  resetting system dates to  a year in which the calendar coincides with that of  and manual workarounds 
the company estimates that all of these plans will be completed by december costs 
as of september   the company had incurred costs of approximately million related to its yk project  of which million has been capitalized 
the estimated additional costs to complete the project are currently expected to be approximately million  of which million is expected to be capitalized 
a significant portion of these costs have not been incremental  but rather reflect redeployment of internal resources from other activities 
the company does not expect these redeployments to have a material adverse effect on other ongoing business operations of the company and its subsidiaries  although it is possible that certain maintenance and upgrading processes will be delayed as the result of the priority being given to yk remediation 
all of the costs of the yk project are being borne out of the company s operating cash flow 
based upon its efforts to date  the company believes that the vast majority of both its it and its non it systems  including all critical and important systems  will remain up and running after january  accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failures will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition 
during  the company will also continue and expand its efforts to ensure that major third party businesses and public and private providers of infrastructure services  such as utilities  communications services and transportation  will also be prepared for the year  and to develop contingency plans to address any failures on their part to become yk compliant 
at this time  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company s operations must rely on such third parties whose systems may not work properly after january  in addition  the company s international operations may be adversely affected by failures of businesses in other parts of the world to take adequate steps to address the yk problem 
while such failures could affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries  either directly or indirectly  in a significant manner  the company cannot at present estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures 
the nature and focus of the company s efforts to address the year problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues are identified 
in addition  it is important to note that the description of the company s efforts necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future 
these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues  and such changes may be substantial 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency euro 
the company conducts business in member countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro will be between january  and june  the company is addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
the more important issues facing the company include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  negotiating and amending licensing agreements and contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
based upon progress to date the company believes that use of the euro will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business affairs and processes its business and accounting records 
accordingly  conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to the company s stockholders 
all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters  including the launching or prospective development of new business initiatives  anticipated motion picture or television releases  internet or theme park and resort projects  year remediation efforts  and preparations for the introduction of the euro  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions  as of the time the statements are made  regarding future events and business performance 
there can be no assurance  however  that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass 
factors that may affect forward looking statements 
for an enterprise as large and complex as the company  a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance  including the following changes in company wide or business unit strategies  which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved or chooses to invest  changes in us  global or regional economic conditions  which may affect attendance and spending at the company s theme parks and resorts  purchases of company licensed consumer products and the performance of the company s broadcasting and motion picture operations  changes in us and global financial and equity markets  including significant interest rate fluctuations  which may impede the company s access to  or increase the cost of  external financing for its operations and investments  increased competitive pressures  both domestically and internationally  which may  among other things  affect the performance of the company s theme park  resort and regional entertainment operations and lead to increased expenses in such areas as television programming acquisition and motion picture production and marketing  legal and regulatory developments that may affect particular business units  such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities  consumer products  broadcasting or internet activities or the protection of intellectual properties  the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas  and changes in international tax laws or currency controls  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  which may  among other things  impair performance at the company s theme parks and resorts  technological developments that may affect the distribution of the company s creative products or create new risks to the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  labor disputes  which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations in any of the company s business units  and changing public and consumer taste  which may affect the company s entertainment  broadcasting and consumer products businesses 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
item a 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the company uses option strategies that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the principal currencies hedged are the japanese yen  french franc  german mark  british pound  canadian dollar and italian lira 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques which can be used in the var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors
