results of operations during fiscal years     and  the company reported net income of     and  respectively 
the company s profits during these five years were achieved primarily as a result of expanding and improving its lease originations  asset management  remarketing and leased equipment sales activities  the sale of other corporate assets and the settlement of litigation and a substantial reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in part due to improved back office efficiency 
during fiscal year  as a result of continuing emphasis on improving lease originations  operating efficiencies and competitive costs of capital  the company generated profits for the sixth consecutive year and twenty fourth consecutive quarter continued to invest in its sales force through an extensive training program and personnel expansion originated leases exceeding million  the highest level during the last five years closed a new million bank facility expanded its financing capabilities by adding a new private investment program acquired a full service computer marketing company  and a wholesale forklift marketing company to enhance its expertise in regards to these two equipment types significant factors which may impact the company s profitability in the future include the ability to develop and to retain the field sales force  the amount of new capital available to the company  the cost of that capital and the ability to increase lease origination levels while achieving profitability targets 
operating results are also subject to fluctuations resulting from several factors  including i seasonality of lease originations  ii variations in the relative percentages of the company s leases entered into during the period which are classified as dfls or ols  or are sold for fee income  and iii the level of income obtained from the sale of leases in excess of lease equipment cost 
the company will adjust its mix of ols and dfls and volume of leases sold to private investors from time to time  when and as the company determines that it would be in its best interests  taking into account profit opportunities  portfolio concentration and residual risk 
presented below is a schedule showing new lease originations volume and placement of new lease originations by fiscal year in thousands 
years ended may  placement equipment under lease sold to pifs    equipment under lease sold to private investors    leases added to the company s lease portfolio a significant portion of which will be were sold during the subsequent fiscal years    total lease origination volume    of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued leasing is an alternative to financing equipment with debt 
therefore  the ultimate profitability of the company s leasing transactions is dependent  in part  on the general level of interest rates 
lease rates tend to rise and to fall with interest rates  although lease rate movements generally lag interest rate movements 
the company is able to originate a certain amount of leases with higher lease rates 
such leases have generally been sold to the pif s because  as pif sponsor  the company has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize investor returns and does so by blending higher yielding transactions with investment grade credit quality leases having lower lease rates 
in the present market environment  the number of higher yielding transactions having adequate credit quality is limited  and consequently  the volume of leases available for sale to the pif s is limited 
the company s response to these factors has been to limit the amount of funds it raises from pif investors 
during fiscal year  the company completed the offering of units in its most recent pif  capital preferred yield fund iv  lp cpyf iv 
the company has elected not to organize additional pifs and future equipment sales to pif s are expected to comprise a significantly smaller percentage of total placements of new lease originations 
the company continues to evaluate additional sources of capital including securitization  private debt placement and or public debt or stock which will provide the liquidity necessary to add leases to its own portfolio 
the goal of such financing will be to lower the company s cost of capital and expand the availability of capital 
the company believes this will enable it to originate leases for its own portfolio which have competitive market lease rates and good credit quality 
the company believes that in the present market there are significant opportunities to originate leases having these characteristics 
however  the company s present capital structure ie  both cost of capital and amount available precludes taking full advantage of market opportunities for such leases 
should the company be successful in identifying and in closing new sources of capital for which no assurance can be given  it intends to grow its own lease portfolio

results of operations  continued equipment sales to pifs equipment sales to the pifs decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and are expected to decrease further in fiscal year because three of the pifs are in their planned liquidation stage and two of the pifs were recently liquidated 
once a pif enters the liquidation stage  it no longer acquires equipment under lease 
two pifs are actively acquiring leases compared to four pifs which were actively acquiring leases in the company has elected not to organize future pifs 
equipment sales to pifs decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year because three of the pifs entered their planned liquidation stage during by the end of  only two pifs were actively acquiring leases compared to five pifs at the end of equipment sales to private investors equipment sales to private investors increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  and in fiscal year compared to fiscal year principally because of the increased volume of lease originations 
the company has  in recent years  invested in its lease origination sales force through extensive training and personnel expansion  adopted a strategy of vertical integration ie  the development of specialized equipment and remarketing expertise and established strategic alliances with investors having a lower cost of capital enabling the company to originate and to sell leases at competitive prices 
the company defers income related to its servicing obligation on certain leases it sells 
this income is amortized over the life of the lease and is included in other income 
catg sales catg sales consist primarily of new information technology hardware 
in conjunction with the sale of hardware  catg also sells software and services 
revenue from such sources is not material to total catg sales 
catg s revenue and margin have been included since november   the date of acquisition 
remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses the company has successfully realized gains on the remarketing of its portfolio of equipment after the initial lease term for the past twenty four consecutive quarters 
the remarketing of equipment for an amount greater than its book value is reported as equipment sales margin if the equipment is sold or as leasing margin if the equipment is re leased 
the realization of less than the carrying value of equipment is recorded as provision for losses which is typically not known until remarketing after the expiration of the initial lease term 
as shown in the tables above  the realizations from sales exceeded the provision for losses for fiscal years  and  even without considering realizations from remarketing activities recorded as leasing margin 
revenue and margins from remarketing sales ie  sales occurring after the initial lease term are affected by the number and the dollar amount of equipment leases that mature in a particular year 
revenue from remarketing sales increased during  compared to primarily due to the sale of approximately million of earth moving equipment and the early termination sale of approximately million of manufacturing equipment 
the company s ability to remarket additional amounts of equipment and realize a greater amount of remarketing revenue in future periods is dependent on adding leases to its portfolio 
however  adding leases to the company s portfolio will not immediately increase the pool of maturing leases because leased equipment is typically not remarketed until after its initial lease term which averages approximately four years 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses  continued the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following significant items other than temporary declines in the value of equipment which occurred primarily because lessees returned equipment to the company at the end of leases 
the company had previously expected to realize the carrying value of such equipment through lease renewals and proceeds from sales of the equipment to the original lessees 
the fair market value of the equipment re leased or sold to third parties is considerably less than was anticipated 
approximately  for two off lease commuter aircraft 
the company engaged mcc financial corporation mcc  the company s majority stockholder and a commuter aircraft remarketer  to remarket the aircraft 
that agent determined that the aircraft could be released within a reasonable remarketing period for an amount that would recover the company s full carrying value over time  or sold for cash immediately but at a book loss 
the company elected to sell the aircraft immediately after determining that the proceeds could be more effectively redeployed in its vertical integration activities and for the equity portion of a potential financing program for leases 
the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following significant items approximately  for other than temporary declines in the value of equipment which occurred primarily because lessees returned equipment to the company at the end of the lease 
the company had previously expected to realize the carrying value of that equipment through lease renewals and proceeds from sale of the equipment to the original lessee 
the fair market value of the equipment re leased or sold to a third party was considerably less than was anticipated 
approximately  as a result of a lease having a net book value of  at february  with a lessee that filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code during the third quarter fiscal the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following significant items approximately  related to the sale of a note receivable on a jet aircraft 
approximately  to write down the carrying value of certain retained residuals 
a reversal of approximately  recorded during fiscal year for estimated loss exposure related to a bankrupt lessee 
during  the lease was restructured and the reserve was no longer needed 
leasing margin leasing margin consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  leasing revenue    leasing costs and expenses    leasing margin    leasing margin ratio of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued leasing margin  continued the increase in leasing revenue  leasing costs and expenses and leasing margin was due to the increase in the volume of lease originations warehoused pending sale to private investors and planned growth in the company s lease portfolio 
these revenue and expense amounts are expected to increase further as the company continues to grow its lease portfolio  and increase the amount of leases warehoused pending sale 
leasing margin ratio fluctuates based upon i the mix of direct finance leases and operating leases  ii remarketing activities  iii the relative age and types of leases in the portfolio operating leases have a lower leasing margin early in the lease term  increasing as the term passes 
leasing margin also includes leasing revenue and leasing cost related to equipment remarketed re leased after the expiration of the initial lease term 
the leasing margin ratio has decreased as the number of new lease originations has increased compared to the number of remarketed leases 
other income other income consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  fees and distributions from pifs    fees from private leasing programs interest on installment sale of equipment other fees and distributions from pifs includes a net gain of  related to the sale of substantially all the leases owned by two pifs 
for the reasons discussed under equipment sales to pifs  the amount of fees and distributions from pif s is expected to decline in future years 
the company recorded an installment sale contract in connection with the settlement agreement reached with respect to the hemmeter litigation which is discussed in footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements to the form k 
during fiscal year  the company received  of cash payments related to the installment sale 
expected future cash payments and interest income under the installment sale are million and 
million  respectively 
operating and other expenses operating and other expenses increased approximately million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year approximately million of the increase was due to catg expenses which have been included in the consolidating financial statements since the acquisition date 
the remaining increase was due primarily to costs associated with the company s investment in its retail marketing infrastructure 
operating and other expenses increased million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase included i  for commissions related to the increase in business volume  ii  for costs associated with the company s investment in its retail marketing infrastructure  and iii  for consulting fees and expenses of the company s majority shareholder 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued interest expense  net interest expense  net consists of the following interest income    non recourse interest expense    net non recourse interest expense   recourse interest expense    interest expense  net    the company finances leases for its own portfolio primarily with non recourse debt 
interest income arises when equipment financed with non recourse debt is sold to investors 
as a result  interest income reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect an amount equal to non recourse interest expense 
therefore  net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals pertains to the company s owned lease portfolio 
such amount increased due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of related discounted lease rentals related to growth in the company s owned portfolio 
it is anticipated that net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals will continue to increase in the future as the company adds additional leases financed with non recourse debt to its portfolio 
recourse interest expense increased during fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased borrowings under the company s warehouse facility used to fund the growth in the number of leases the company holds for sale to private investors 
recourse interest expense decreased during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the reductions in the outstanding balance of the term loan portion of the company s debt facility 
income taxes as shown in the table in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company s significant deferred tax assets consist of an itc carryforward of approximately million which expires from through and alternative minimum tax amt credits of million which are not subject to expiration 
these tax assets are available to offset federal income tax liability 
however  the amount of itc and amt credit carryforward that may be utilized to reduce tax liability is significantly limited due to the computation of amt liability 
as a result of the future expiration of the itc carryforward  the company has established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty that the itc carryforward will be fully utilized prior to expiration 
income tax expense is provided on income at the appropriate statutory rates applicable to such earnings 
the appropriate statutory federal and state income tax rate for fiscal years  and was approximately 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are recognized as a separate component of the provision for income tax expense 
consequently  the actual income tax rate for fiscal years  and was less than the effective rate of primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance 
the decrease in the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal represents the utilization of an itc carryforward for which a valuation allowance had been provided  and reduction in the uncertainty about future utilization of itc carryforwards prior to expiration 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded during the quarter ended may  and resulted in an income tax benefit of  the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal represents the utilization of an itc carryforward and the receipt of a state income tax refund for which a valuation allowance had been provided 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued income taxes  continued during fiscal year  a transaction was completed in which the company s largest shareholder obtained more than fifty percent of the ownership and voting rights of the company within a three year period a change in control 
upon a change in control  provisions of the internal revenue code limit the amount of itc carryforwards and amt carryforwards that could be utilized to reduce income tax liability in any year 
however  the company had previously established a valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to uncertainty that the full amount of the itc carryforward would be utilized prior to expiration and therefore  the change in control and resulting limitation on the itc and amt carryforward is not expected to reduce the recoverability of the amount of the net deferred income tax assets  net of the valuation allowance

liquidity and capital resources the company s activities are principally funded by proceeds from sales of on lease equipment to its pifs or private investors  non recourse debt  recourse bank debt see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  rents  fees and distributions from its pifs  and sales or re leases of equipment after the expiration of the initial lease terms 
in addition  the company finances receivables of its catg subsidiary under an agreement with a specialized finance company 
management believes the company s ability to generate cash from operations is sufficient to fund operations  as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company s bank facility was expanded during fiscal to a total of million 
the term of the bank facility is one year 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s bank facility 
historically  the company sold a significant portion of its lease originations to the pifs 
during fiscal  the company completed the offering of units in the most recent pif  capital preferred yield fund iv 
the company has elected not to organize additional pifs 
consequently  future equipment sales to pifs will reflect only the reinvestment needs of the existing pifs  and therefore are expected to represent smaller amounts of equipment sales margin and cash flow 
however  leases that in the past would have been originated for sale to the pif s are expected to be retained by the company 
this strategy is expected to increase the company owned leased portfolio 
an increase in the size of the company s lease portfolio is expected to result in an increase in a the company s revenue and ultimate profitability and b the amount of capital needed to fund leasing activities 
permanent non recourse debt generally provides financing for of the cost of leased equipment 
consequently  the company continues to evaluate additional sources of capital including securitization  private debt placement and or public debt or stock which will provide the liquidity necessary to add leases to its own portfolio 
the goal of such financing will be to lower the company s cost of capital and expand the availability of capital 
additional lease warehouse financing consisting of both recourse and non recourse facilities provides the company with the funding necessary to originate and to hold leases on a temporary basis in anticipation of sale to private investors or until permanent funding is arranged for leases it holds in its own portfolio 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued ii 
liquidity and capital resources  continued the company intends to securitize leases it adds to its portfolio 
in a securitization transaction  the company sells and transfers a pool of leases to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary sps of the company 
the sps simultaneously sells and transfers an interest in the leases to multiple financing conduits  in return for cash advances against the leases 
the company retains the right to receive any cash flows in excess of those necessary to service repayment of the cash advances 
the company is negotiating a new million securitization program to increase the availability of permanent funding for lease originations 
the company hopes to complete the first funding under the securitization program during the first quarter of fiscal  however  such programs are expensive to implement and are subject to significant delays and there can be no assurance that it will ever be completed 
the company finances receivables and inventory for its catg subsidiary under an agreement with deutsche financial services 
at may   accounts receivable  net included  of receivables related to the company s catg subsidiary which were eligible collateral under the financing agreement 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
year issues the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year issue results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs which have time sensitive software could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in major system failures or miscalculations 
certain of the company s software have already been updated to software which correctly accounts for the year in addition  the company is engaged in a system conversion  whereby the company s main lease tracking and accounting software is being replaced with new systems which will account for the year correctly 
the company does not expect any other changes required for the year to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the company does not expect any year issues relating to its customers and vendors will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the company expensed all amounts related to its review of the year issue 
amounts expended to date to address the year issue have been immaterial
