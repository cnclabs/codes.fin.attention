risk factors limited operating history 
the company commenced operations in july and shipped version of siebel sales enterprise in april  version in december  and version in february the company shipped siebel service enterprise version in december  and subsequently shipped version in february the company has only a limited operating history  and its prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by a company in its early stage of development 
reliance on andersen consulting and other relationships  dependence on system integrators 
the company has established strategic relationships with a number of organizations that it believes are important to its worldwide sales  marketing and support activities and the implementation of its products 
the company believes that its relationships with such organizations provide marketing and sales opportunities for the company s direct sales force and expand the distribution of its products 
these relationships also assist the company in keeping pace with the technological and marketing developments of major software vendors  and  in certain instances  provide it with technical assistance for its product development efforts 
in particular  the company has established a non exclusive strategic relationship with andersen consulting  a principal stockholder of the company 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from customers for which andersen consulting had been engaged to provide system integration services 
any deterioration of the company s relationship with andersen consulting could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited deployment 
many of the company s customers are in the pilot phase of implementing the company s software 
there can be no assurance that enterprise wide deployments by such customers will be successful 
the company s customers frequently contemplate the deployment of its products commercially to large numbers of sales  marketing and customer service personnel  many of whom have not previously used application software systems  and there can be no assurance of such end users acceptance of the product 
if any of the company s customers are not able to customize and deploy siebel enterprise applications successfully and on a timely basis to the number of anticipated users  the company s reputation could be significantly damaged  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
reliance on single product family 
approximately of the company s license revenues in fiscal were attributable to sales of siebel sales enterprise 
the remaining revenues were attributable to sales of siebel service enterprise 
the company currently expects siebel sales enterprise and related maintenance and training services to continue to account for a substantial majority of the company s future revenues 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for siebel sales enterprise  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on large license fee contracts and customer concentration 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of the company s revenues 
for and  sales to the company s largest customers accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
for  one company accounted for of total revenues 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any major customer or any reduction or delay in orders by any such customer  or the failure of the company to market successfully its products to new customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth  dependence upon key personnel 
in the event that the significant growth of the company s revenues continues  such growth may place a significant strain upon the company s management systems and resources 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employee work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  particularly thomas m 
siebel  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  none of whom has entered into an employment agreement with the company 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
international operations 
the company s sales are primarily to large multi national companies 
to service the needs of such companies  both domestically and internationally  the company must provide worldwide product support services 
as a result  the company has expanded and intends to continue to expand its international operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources and could adversely affect the company s operating margins and earnings  if any 
revenues from international sales accounted for approximately and of the company s total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the growth in the company s revenues from international sales is expected to continue to subject a portion of the company s revenues to the risks associated with international sales  including foreign currency fluctuations  economic or political instability  shipping delays and various trade restrictions  any of which could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the company develops an international sales force  it expects to be more directly subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
to the extent such direct sales are denominated in foreign currency  any such fluctuation may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
risk relating to acquisitions 
the company has acquired in the past  and may acquire in the future  other products or businesses which are complementary to the company s business 
the integration of products and personnel as a result of any such acquisitions has and will continue to divert the company s management and other resources 
there can be no assurance that difficulties will not arise in integrating such operations  products  personnel or businesses 
the failure to successfully integrate such products or operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
