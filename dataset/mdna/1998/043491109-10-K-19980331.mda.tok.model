at december   the company had million in working capital 
the company currently has no significant capital commitments other than commitments under facilities and operating leases 
the company believes that its available sources of funds and anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate to finance current operations  anticipated investments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company s registration statement on form s a no 
filed on april  in connection with the acquisition of cascade 
this report on form k should be read in conjunction with such form s  particularly the section entitled risk factors 
these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to competition  the mix of products sold  the mix of distribution channels employed  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products  the company s ability to attract and retain key employees  the company s success in integrating acquired operations  the company s dependence on single or limited source suppliers for certain components used in its products  price reductions for the company s products  risks inherent in international sales  changes in the levels of inventory held by third party resellers  the timing of orders from and shipments to customers  seasonality and general economic conditions 
in particular  a substantial portion of the company s sales of max and pipeline products is related to the internet industry 
in north america  the company sells a substantial percentage of its products  particularly its max products  to isps 
additionally  a substantial portion of the compay s sales of core systems products is reltated to the telecommunications carrier industry 
in north america  the company sells a substantial percentage of the core systems products to public carriers 
there can be no assurance that these industries and their infrastructure will continue to develop or that acceptance of the company s products by these industries will be sustained 
the company believes competition in the internet and public carrier industry will increase significantly in the future and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has concluded the acquisition of four companies in and five companies in achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or any other acquisitions the company may undertake will depend in part upon whether the integration of the acquired companies products and technologies  research and development activities  and sales  marketing and administrative organizations is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
moreover  the integration process may temporarily divert management attention from the day to day business of the company 
failure to successfully accomplish the integration of the acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company expects that its gross margins could be adversely affected in future periods by price changes as a result of increased competition 
in addition  increased sales of pipeline products as a percentage of net sales may adversely affect the company s gross margins in future periods as these products have lower gross margins than the company s other products 
in addition  the company s use of third parties to distribute its products to other value added resellers may adversely affect the company s gross margins 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales in future periods 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company depends on third party resellers for a substantial portion of its international sales 
certain of these third party resellers also act as resellers for competitors of the company that can devote greater effort and resources to marketing competitive products 
the loss of certain of these third party resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
although the company s sales are denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
furthermore  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales  and  in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
in addition  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world typically are adversely affected in the third quarter of each calendar year as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
these seasonal factors may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company typically operates with a relatively small backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on the volume of  timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in the company s most recent quarters  the sequential sales growth slowed from prior levels  and a disproportionate share of the sales occurred in the last month of the quarter 
these occurrences are extremely difficult to predict and may happen in the future 
the company s ability to meet financial expectations could be hampered if the nonlinear sales pattern continues in future periods 
accordingly  the cancellation or delay of even a small percentage of customer purchases could adversely affect the company s results of operations in the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s net sales in prior periods has been derived from relatively large sales to a limited number of customers  and therefore the failure of the company to secure expected large sales may have a material adverse impact on results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s expense levels is relatively fixed in advance based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the introduction of new products requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
furthermore  products such as those offered by the company may contain undetected or unresolved hardware problems or software errors when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite extensive testing by the company  hardware problems or software errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in delay in or loss of market acceptance 
future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  and therefore computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company is concerned that many enterprises will be devoting a substantial portion of their information systems spending to resolving this upcoming year problem 
this may result in spending being diverted from networking solutions over the next three years 
additionally  the company will have to devote resources to providing the year solution for its own products 
the year issue could lower demand for the company s products while increasing the company s costs 
these combining factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company believes the majority of its major systems are currently year compliant  and costs to transition the company s remaining systems to year compliance are not anticipated to be material 
there can be no assurance that systems operated by third parties that interfere with or contain the company s products will timely achieve year compliance 
any failure of these third parties systems to timely achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company mainly competes in four segments of the data networking market i wide area network wan and internet access  ii wan and internet backbone switching  iii remote lan access and internet subscriber access  and iv videoconferencing and multimedia access 
the company competes in one or more of these market segments with cisco systems  inc  com corporation  bay networks  inc  newbridge networks  inc  shiva corporation  northern telecom  inc  and many others 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
the company expects additional competition from existing competitors and from a number of other companies  some of which may have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company  that may enter the company s existing and future markets 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  each of which would adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s sales are  to a significant degree  made through telecommunications carriers  value added resellers vars and distributors 
accordingly  the company is dependent on the continued viability and financial stability of these companies 
while the company has contractual relationships with many telecommunications carriers  vars and distributors  these agreements do not require these companies to purchase the company s products and can be terminated by these companies at any time 
there can be no assurance that any of the telecommunications carriers  vars or distributors will continue to market the company s products 
the telecommunications carrier customers  to the extent they are resellers  vars and distributors  generally offer products of several different companies  including products that are competitive with the company s products 
accordingly  there is a risk that these companies may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell the company s products 
any special distribution arrangement and product pricing arrangement that the company may implement in one or more distribution channels for strategic purposes could adversely affect gross profit margins 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its key management  sales  marketing and product development personnel 
the company does not have employment contracts with its key personnel and does not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the company 
the company is currently experiencing rapid growth and expansion  which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on its systems and controls 
this growth has resulted in a continuing increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company anticipates that its continued growth will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful at hiring or retaining these personnel 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully will also require the company to continue to expand and improve its operational  management and financial systems and controls and to expand its manufacturing capacity 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
the company relies on a combination of patents  copyright  and trade secret laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary technology 
the company is currently involved in patent disputes the results of which are not presently determinable 
such disputes could result in significant expenses to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical management personnel 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  certain components  including certain key microprocessors and integrated circuits  are presently available only from a single source or from limited sources 
the company has no supply commitments from its vendors and generally purchases components on a purchase order basis as opposed to entering into long term procurement agreements with vendors 
the company has generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from current vendors or  when necessary to meet production needs  from alternate vendors 
the company believes that  in most cases  alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill needs 
however  delays or failure to identify alternate vendors  if required  or a reduction or interruption in supply  or a significant increase in the price of components could adversely affect the company s revenues and financial results and could impact customer relations 
the company s common stock has experienced significant price volatility  and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company or other companies in the networking industry  announcements by the company or competitors regarding new product introductions or other developments affecting the company and or changes in financial estimates by public market analysts 
in addition  the market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stocks and that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
recent periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities resulted in securities class action litigation against the company and various officers and directors 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of the company 
in consideration of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain growth in revenues or profitability  particularly on a period to period basis
