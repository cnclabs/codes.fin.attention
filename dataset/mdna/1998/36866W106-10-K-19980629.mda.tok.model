item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  markets and licenses proprietary technologies and systems that simplify and enhance consumers interaction with electronics products and other platforms that deliver video  programming information and other data 
the company generates revenues through licensing of their technology and intellectual property to consumer electronics manufacturers  service providers  software developers  microchip makers and internet appliance manufacturers  as well as to newspapers and television guide publishers through a combination of upfront  non refundable license payments and per unit license fees 
historically  the primary source of revenues has been license fees paid by consumer electronics manufacturers and publications for the licensing of the vcr plus technology and the right to print the pluscode numbers  respectively 
starting fiscal year  the company began to derive significant license revenues from the gemstar guide technology 
revenues from up front license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the particular license and revenues from on going per unit license fees are recognized when payments are due  and generally  when payments are actually received from the licensee 
the company acquired videoguide  inc videoguide and starsight telecast  inc starsight in december and may  respectively 
both acquisitions were accounted for under the pooling of interests method and accordingly  the company s historical consolidated financial statements were restated for all periods to include the accounts and results of operations of videoguide and starsight 
both videoguide and starsight incurred substantial operating losses since their inception through the date of acquisition by the company 
due to these losses  the restated financial results as reported contain significant marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses resulting in significant operating losses during certain periods 
all of the selling and marketing efforts and a portion of the research and development effort expended by videoguide were directed toward marketing a subscription based electronic program guide service delivered through the mhz paging signal 
after the acquisition  the videoguide service was terminated in september a significant portion of the selling and marketing and research and development effort of starsight was directed toward marketing a subscription based electronic program guide service delivered through the vertical blanking interval of the television signal 
a significant portion of the general and administrative expenses incurred by starsight prior to the acquisition was comprised of legal fees related to litigation with the company  which terminated upon the acquisition 
the fiscal year results show significant cost reductions after the acquisitions of videoguide and starsight which was due primarily to the implementation of the company s cost control measures 
such measures resulted in lower payroll costs due to headcount reductions  cost savings from combining marketing and development efforts and reduction of legal costs by eliminating the litigation between the company and starsight 
the company also realized synergies of the combined companies which resulted in further cost savings 
recent developments the company has integrated the technical expertise of videoguide and starsight to better serve the respective needs of consumer electronics manufacturers and service providers  and combined the technologies developed by videoguide and starsight into the gemstar guide technology 
the company also developed significant strategic relationships in the consumer electronics and computer internet appliance sectors 

in november  the company entered into a multi year license agreement with thomson for the gemstar guide technology and entered into a joint venture  tdn  inc  for the exploration of advertising  promotion  linking and transaction opportunities through interactive program guides on consumer electronics platforms 

in january  the company entered into a worldwide cross licensing agreement with microsoft in which the two companies agreed to cross license their respective intellectual property in the interactive program guide area and under which microsoft agreed to license the company s intellectual property in all microsoft interactive program guide products
