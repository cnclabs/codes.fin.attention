item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
in this context  the discussion in this item contains forward looking statements which involve a certain degree of risk and uncertainty  including statements relating to liquidity and capital resources 
factors that could cause or contribute to the actualization of such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the market acceptance of and the demand for the company s products  the development of technology and manufacturing capabilities  the restructuring of channel efforts for the consumer market  the impact of competitive products on the company s profitability  dependence on relationships with significant customers and the company s dependence upon third party suppliers 
overview the company was incorporated in april to develop and market advanced d interactive motion control hardware and software products for the industrial cad cam cae workstation market 
historically  the company has generated revenues from sales of bundled hardware and software  and such sales are dependent upon prior incorporation of the company s enabling software into d applications developed by isvs 
product revenues generated by the incorporation of the company s software into a specific isv application may lag six to eighteen months after the incorporation activity is completed 
in fiscal  the company launched its first hardware and software products aimed at the industrial pc marketplace 
early in fiscal  the company began marketing its first stand alone software product for the pc cad marketplace  and commenced limited test marketing of its first consumer product  targeted at pc games 
in late fiscal  the company began marketing the ergonomically improved  cost reduced version of the consumer product to the oem marketplace as the initial step in its goal of achieving long term growth in the consumer sector 
the company commenced shipments of its new game controller into the consumer market in the third quarter of fiscal for reasons of manufacturing and volume efficiencies  the company contracts all of its hardware manufacturing to outside sources 
primary manufacturing of its products had previously been through multiple domestic contract manufacturers  with final functional testing and quality control performed by the company 
late in fiscal  the company began directing its manufacturing to an offshore contract manufacturer to further reduce the cost of goods 
currently  the majority of spacetec products are produced by the offshore contract manufacturer 
research and development comprises both hardware and software activities 
hardware development has focused on creating products utilizing the company s core hardware technology  but designed for specific end use markets  and engineering these components to reduce manufacturing costs 
this has resulted in products for the workstation  pc and consumer markets  and significant cost reductions in the core technology 
in fiscal  the company began sampling its proprietary low cost eclipse asic chip for use in its own proprietary controllers 
the eclipse asic chip has successfully been incorporated into both consumer and industrial products 
the primary activity in software development has been to create specialized d motion control software and software tools to enable the company s products to be integrated into specific application software 
the company offers an open software development kit sdk to the development community for integration into their applications 
integration of the sdk enables the company s d input controllers to work with specific software 
with access to the source code  the developer can take control of the implementation and add value wherever possible by going native 
software development activities have increased as the number of d applications into which the company s software has been integrated has increased  and upon entering the professional pc multimedia animation market and consumer multimedia edutainment market with d interactive software programs 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march revenues 
the company s revenues consist of sales of industrial and consumer products  and license fees 
revenues decreased to  for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year from  for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues is attributable to a reduction in the sales of the company s spaceorb reallife d spaceorb game controller into the consumer retail channel 
during the fiscal year  management refocused the sales force on the industrial business and increased sales in this market by to  for the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
sales to the industrial market for the fiscal year were negatively impacted by the launch of the spaceball  a new lower priced input device for workstation based d cad applications  which essentially replaced the higher priced spaceball 
the company had anticipated that unit sales would increase sufficiently to offset the decrease in price 
however  these expectations were not realized as the company was unable to encourage additional bundling of the by its oems as rapidly as anticipated 
other revenues  which include consumer sales and licensing arrangements decreased in the fiscal year to  from  in the fiscal year 
licensing arrangements decreased in the fiscal year primarily from the company discontinuing its d graphics acceleration software business 
consumer retail sales of the spaceorb also declined in the fiscal year 
while the spaceorb has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the early adopter  hard core gamer market  sales to the mass market have lagged due to delays in customer acceptance of the product and inadequate channel sales 
the company has been unable to clearly differentiate its product from other lower priced computer control devices 
as a result  management has shifted its sales focus from direct retail channels to establishing original equipment manufacturer oem and strategic alliance partnerships in the consumer business 
as part of its corporate strategy  management expects to continue to emphasize the industrial business and pursue additional strategic alliance partnerships and oem relationships 
however  there is no assurance that forging additional relationships will be able to generate substantial revenue  if at all 
two customers represented and of the company s revenues for the fiscal year as compared with two customers representing and of sales for the fiscal year 
revenue generated through the company s foreign subsidiaries totaled  and represented of total revenues for the fiscal year 
these sales are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located 
although denominated in foreign currency  exchange rate fluctuations have been not been material 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit is arrived at after the costs of materials  manufacturing overhead  royalties and amortization of capitalized software are subtracted from revenues 
gross profit increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues reflects the proportionately higher margins available from the industrial market  which has been the area of principal focus by the company during the fiscal year 
gross profit in both the fiscal year and fiscal year was negatively impacted by write downs of inventory and capitalized software of  and  respectively  related to the consumer market 
during the fiscal year  the company recognized charges of  for the write down of inventory and  for the write down of capitalized software and in the fiscal year  charges of  for the write down of inventory and  for the write down of capitalized software associated with the spaceorb were incurred 
the charges in the fiscal year resulted from the cessation of a retail marketing program 
in the fiscal year  the company had reviewed the projected revenue stream associated with the sales of the spaceorb product and had determined that the recoverability of the costs of the inventory and capitalized software was uncertain 
as of march   the company has attached no value to inventory and capitalized software related to the spaceorb  and does not anticipate further write downs related to this product 
however  in the future  there can be no assurance that the company will avoid write downs related to other current products or products in development 
as the company shifts its sales mix from direct to oem channels for industrial and consumer products  it is expected that the gross profit percentage currently experienced by the company  will not be sustainable 
generally  the company realizes a lower profit on its sales through oems and therefore expects that increases in the volume of its products through oem channels will negatively impact its gross profit 
the company s expectations regarding the decline in gross profit percentage is a forward looking statement 
there can be no assurance that such decreases in profit will not be greater than anticipated 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses  which include principally personnel costs and sales commissions  and to a lesser extent  tradeshow expenses and expenses related to advertising and marketing  decreased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
during the fiscal year  significant marketing expenses associated with a direct presence in the retail channel were eliminated 
in addition  the company realized savings from cost containment programs implemented at the end of the fiscal year and eliminated broad based advertising and public relations activities in favor of focused marketing events 
going forward  the company anticipates that selling and marketing expenses will be reduced as a percentage of revenues as it is anticipated that revenues will increase and expenses will remain stable 
the company has recently invested in additional salespeople and new sales offices  both domestically and internationally  which were not established long enough in the fiscal year to impact revenues significantly 
the company s expectations regarding the decline of selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues and the increase in revenues are forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that expenses will not be greater than anticipated or that revenues will not be less expected 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct the company s software and hardware development and engineering efforts  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditure in the fiscal year resulted from hiring additional engineering research personnel at higher skill levels and therefore at higher average salaries 
this investment was necessary to expand the company s software product development efforts  particularly in developing software for stand alone revenue generation unrelated to current hardware offerings 
in the fiscal year   of research and development expenses were recorded as capitalized software related to the spaceorb in comparison  the company did not capitalize any research and development expenses in the fiscal year  as technological feasibility was not reached 
the company has focused its research and development efforts on the development of several new products  slated for release during the fiscal year 
the spaceball and the enhanced sdk will require additional research and development funding during the upcoming year 
although the company anticipates that research and development expenses in the fiscal year will stabilize at dollar levels similar to the fiscal year results  the continued development of both the spaceball and the enhanced sdk as well as development of additional products under consideration could cost more than expected  and there can be no assurance that these expenses will not be greater than anticipated 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which include the costs of the company s corporate finance  human resources and administrative functions  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  and represented and of sales  respectively 
the increase is associated with increases in accounting  legal  and administration fees related to the establishment of three wholly owned subsidiaries in each of germany  france and the united kingdom  and to the acquisition of spatial systems limited ssl 
additionally  the company incurred severance costs of approximately  in connection with the termination of an executive officer  as well as a loss of  related to the write off of intangible assets associated with its panacea graphics acceleration software business 
management anticipates that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars for the year ended march  however  there can be no assurance that these expenses will not be greater than anticipated 
provision for income taxes 
as the company has recognized losses in the fiscal year  it has not recorded a provision for income taxes 
the benefit attributable to the carryback of losses to prior fiscal years was fully utilized during the fiscal year ended march  the company has unbenefited federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  year compliance 
the company s d controller products do not use any date related processing in the hardware or driver software 
consequently  the company has determined that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year for the products it has sold 
the company has in turn obtained assurance from its vendors that the hardware and software that is used in its day to day business activities ie accounting software is year compliant 
based upon representations received to date  the company believes that its business  financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by any failure of third party software 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s customers and vendors will not be affected by the year and that the failure of its customers and vendors to become compliant for the year  will not have an adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
comparison of fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march revenues 
revenues increased to  in the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year 
the increase in revenues is attributable to the company s launch of the spaceorb into the consumer market 
this was the first year that the company sold a consumer product 
two customers represented and of the company s revenues for the fiscal year as compared with two customers representing and of sales for the fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit  decreased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
gross profit declined mainly due to write offs of capitalized software and a write down of inventory to net realizable value 
the company completed an evaluation of the projected revenue stream associated with inventory components related to the spaceorb and capitalized software  which indicated that the recoverability of the costs of these assets was uncertain 
the company recognized a  charge for the write down of its capitalized software and a  charge for the write down of its inventory 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the initial marketing program for the spaceorb  including extensive non recurring television advertising and promotion expenses in excess of  additional personnel and recruiting costs associated with an expansion of the sales and marketing infrastructure were also incurred during the year 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase reflects significant investments in personnel and consultants necessary to expand software product development efforts  particularly in the consumer  multimedia and pc cad markets  and engineering efforts designed to lower the cost of manufacturing of the company s hardware components 
research and development expenses that were recorded as capitalized software costs decreased to  for the fiscal year in comparison with  for the fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which include the costs of the company s corporate finance  human resources and administrative functions  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  and represented and of sales respectively 
the increase is associated with increased personnel costs to expand the administrative infrastructure as well as increases in professional fees and filing fees due to additional reporting requirements consequent upon becoming a public company 
provision for income taxes

quarterly operating results the following tables set forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the company  for the fiscal year and fiscal year 
this information has been derived from the quarterly financial statements of the company which are unaudited but which  in the opinion of management  have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
three month period ended june sept dec mar june sept dec mar revenues         gross profit        loss from operations     net loss   basic and diluted loss per common share basic and diluted loss per common share are presented to conform with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future  on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include  without limitation i the timing and size of orders which are received and can be shipped in any particular period  ii the commercial success of the company s products  iii delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements by the company and the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  iv the financial stability of the company s major customers  v the timing of new product introductions or announcements by the company or its competitors  vi the seasonality of the placement of customer orders  vii the timing and nature of selling and marketing expenses such as tradeshows and advertising campaigns  viii the timing of development expenditures and personnel changes  ix customer order deferrals in anticipation of product enhancements or new product offerings by the company or its competitors  x customer cancellation of orders and the gain or loss of significant customers  xi the mix of products sold  and xii the mix of oem and direct sales to end users 
the company has historically operated with little backlog because its products are generally shipped immediately upon receipt of an order by the company 
as a result  revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and on sales by the company s customers to end users 
the company has historically recognized a large portion of its revenues from sales booked and shipped in the last month of a quarter such that the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or at the end of  a particular quarter 
because a number of the company s individual orders are for significant amounts  the failure to ship a significant order in a particular quarter could materially adversely affect revenues and results of operations for such quarter 
to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  results of operations for subsequent quarters may be materially adversely affected 
due to these and other factors  the company s quarterly revenues  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its revenues in future periods or be able to sustain its level of revenues or its rate of growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the initial public offering of its common stock in december as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  and working capital of  versus  and  respectively at march  the company has no outstanding line of credit or other indebtedness for borrowed money 
the company used  to fund operating activities in the current year as compared with  used in operations in the prior year 
the use of funds in the fiscal year is primarily attributable to the net loss of  which was offset by a reduction in inventories  income taxes receivable and accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the change in accounts receivable from using cash of  in the fiscal year  to providing cash of  in the fiscal year is the result of enhanced collection efforts over the course of the year 
the change in inventory to providing cash of  in the fiscal year from using cash of  in the fiscal year resulted from the overall reduction of on hand quantities of inventory coupled with write downs of spaceorb inventory in the fiscal year 
inventory levels were high in the fiscal year as the company had made significant investments in inventory related to the spaceorb in order to have the necessary anticipated quantities on hand for sale during the peak retail christmas season 
in the fiscal year  the company made an effort to reduce its overall inventories  especially those related to the spaceorb however  as the company was unable to sell the on hand quantities of this product  and as systems configurations had changed  management determined that the inventory value was impaired 
therefore  a write down of  related to the spaceorb was taken in the fiscal year 
also during the fiscal year  the company received income tax refunds of  resulting from the carryback of the fiscal year net operating loss to the three previous years 
the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses from providing cash of  in the fiscal year from using cash of  in the fiscal year is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
the overall improvement in cash from operating activities from a use of  in the fiscal year to a use of  in the fiscal year was due to considerable efforts by management to improve the overall balance sheet 
net cash provided to the company through investing activities totaled  during the fiscal year 
the increase is attributable to net proceeds in the amount of  generated from net sales of the company s available for sale securities 
the increase was offset by  for purchases of furniture and equipment  primarily computer equipment  and  for purchases of intangible assets 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year will mirror capital expenditures for the fiscal year  but it has no commitments or specific plans for any significant purchases 
financing activities used  of net cash in the current year 
the company spent  to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
the cost was offset by  which was received upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the company believes existing cash and investment securities together with future anticipated funds from operations  will satisfy its projected working capital and other cash requirements through the end of its fiscal year ending march  substantial  additional funds will be required to continue software and hardware development  as well as to develop the sales and marketing infrastructure  distribution channels and market awareness of the company s products 
the company believes the level of financial resources available to it is an important competitive factor in its industry and may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace 
changes in technology or growth in revenues beyond currently established capabilities will also require further investment 
to the extent that the company s current financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s operating requirements  it may be necessary for the company to seek additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to the existing stockholders will result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business would be materially adversely affected  and  as a result  the company may be required to curtail its operations significantly 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund its long term working capital requirements  or that it will be able if necessary  to obtain equity financing on favorable terms  if at all

the company will not undertake and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events which may cause management to re evaluate such forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
fluctuations in results of operations 
the company s results of operations have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future  on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
see quarterly operating results for the factors affecting operating results 
developing market 
during the fiscal year  the company began to market its products designed for the consumer marketplace 
the company has had little experience in marketing its products to consumers 
the entry into the consumer market has created considerable risks for the company  some of which are outside of the company s control 
see part business products 
expansion into retail distribution channels 
the company commenced retail shipments of its spaceorb during fiscal retail distribution channel sales have required significantly greater marketing and sales expenditures and post sale support costs than the company s industrial sector products 
penetration of this market has depended upon building relationships with distributors and retailers 
an increasing number of vendors compete for access to these distributors and retailers  which generally offer products of several different companies  including products competitive with the company s products 
the company has committed substantial resources to the penetration of this distribution channel to date 
the company s efforts to commence sales through retail distribution sales channels have not been as successful as anticipated  and the inability of the company to penetrate this sales channel effectively has had a material adverse effect on its operating results 
as a result of the company s efforts in penetrating this sales channel  the gross margins have decreased as the company has had to price its products at low levels to penetrate this market 
the company has noted that its sales to retail channels have been significantly affected by seasonality primarily due to the increased demand for d game and entertainment applications and related products during the year end holiday buying season 
retail distributors have been permitted to return inventory to the company for credit against other purchases on negotiated terms 
in addition  the company has granted retail distributors price protection clauses in agreements with the company pursuant to which the company has been obligated to grant credits when the company has reduced selling prices on products previously purchased by the distributor 
moreover  to the extent the company generates significant sales to retail distribution channels relative to its sales to oems  there is a greater risk of increased product returns and warranty claims 
the company has established reserves for product returns and warranty claims based on its previous experiences and future expectations 
there can be no assurance that these reserves will be adequate or that product returns and warranty claims and price protection adjustments will not have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
reliance on third party distribution channels 
the company expects to increase its product sales through third party distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  value added resellers vars  system integrators and distributors 
such oems and vars are not under the control of the company 
although these customers in turn sell to a wide variety of end users  the company is subject not only to the risk that its customers will discontinue selling and marketing its products  but also to the risk that the end users supplied by the company s customers will alter their preferences in a manner that has a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its current resellers or expand its distribution channels by entering into arrangements with new resellers 
dependence on relationships with independent software vendors isvs 
the company maintains relationships with independent software vendors which incorporate the company s enabling software into their d applications 
as a result  sales of the company s products are dependent upon the continued market acceptance of the product application offerings of the isvs 
the isvs are under no contractual obligation to incorporate the company s enabling software into their products applications 
the incorporation of the company s enabling software can involve a substantial amount of time and money 
sales of the company s hardware products can lag from to months behind the actual incorporation of the company s enabling software into the isv s application 
any delay in the product development of an isv or a decision by the isv to incorporate the enabling software of a competitor of the company into its products applications would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  dependence on new product development 
the electronics industry in general  and the markets for the company s products in particular  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and significant competition 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards present opportunities for current and potential competitors of the company to gain market share and can quickly render the company s products less attractive or obsolete and unmarketable 
in order to keep pace with this rapidly changing market environment  the company must continually develop and incorporate into its products new technological advances and features desired by the marketplace at acceptable prices 
the successful development and commercialization of new products involves many risks  including the identification of new product opportunities  the timely completion of the development process  the control and recoupment of development and production costs and acceptance by customers of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products in a timely and cost effective manner  that the company s products will be accepted in the marketplace  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies uncompetitive 
dependence on relationships with significant customers 
the company sells substantially all of its products to and maintains strategic relationships with original equipment manufactures oems and value added resellers vars 
as a result  sales of the company s products are dependent upon the continued market acceptance of the service and product offerings of the company s customers 
although the company maintains contractual relationships with a substantial number of its customers  such contracts do not provide for minimum purchase requirements  nor do they contain provisions requiring the exclusive purchase of the company s products 
competition 
the market for computer products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the company s products currently compete against established products and no assurance can be given that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by technological advances of others 
the company expects that competition from existing competitors will increase and that new competitors will enter the d motion control market 
many of the existing and potential competitors have experienced management  larger technical staffs  more established and larger marketing and sales organizations  better developed distribution systems and significantly greater financial resources than the company 
the company anticipates that its competitors will ultimately develop hardware products based on technology that does not infringe on the patent rights of the company  which may provide capabilities similar or superior to those of the company s products 
increased competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
patents and proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary hardware and software technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  software license agreements  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures to protect its rights pertaining to its products 
such protection may not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to the company s products 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and defend united states and foreign patent protection for its products and preserve its trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that the company s issued patents  or any future patents  will provide the company with significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by the company will not be infringed upon by others 
in the case of infringement of the company s technologies  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to afford the expense of any litigation that may be necessary to enforce its proprietary rights 
in addition to seeking patent protection  in some cases the company may rely on contractual arrangements or trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that trade secrets will be developed and maintained  that secrecy obligations will be honored  or that others will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
disputes as to the ownership of such information may arise if consultants  key employees  or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to company projects  and such disputes may not be resolved in favor of the company 
due to the importance of patent and trade secret protections and the competitive nature of its industry  the company may also be subject to claims that its technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of other companies 
there can be no assurance that such claims will not arise  that the company will have sufficient resources to pursue any resulting litigation to a final judgment  or that the company will prevail in such litigation 
dependence on contract manufacturers  including overseas manufacturers 
the company has and will continue to rely on outside vendors to manufacture hardware devices among the company s products 
although the company s hardware devices are relatively simple devices to manufacture  and the company has not encountered any delays in obtaining adequate products from its outside contracting organizations  there can be no assurance that delays incurred or quality problems caused by any of the contract manufacturing organizations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to fill customer orders 
in  the company entered into a manufacturing contract with a entity located in the people s republic of china 
the company s reliance on outside manufacturers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products  and reduced control over the price  timeliness of delivery  reliability and quality of finished products 
certain of the company s contract manufacturers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
any inability to obtain timely deliveries of products and services having acceptable qualities or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of contract manufacturing services or to manufacture its own hardware devices internally  could delay the company s ability to ship its products 
any such delay could damage relationships with customers and such delay could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the use of a foreign manufacturer  in a country with an emerging commercial base  subjects the company to additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs and difficulties in communications with such foreign entity 
finally  the laws of certain countries do not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that such foreign manufacturer fails to perform in accordance with its contract with the company or to the extent the company has other claims against such manufacturer  it may be difficult to enforce such claims in the peoples republic of china 
attraction and retention of key employees 
the company is dependent on the principal members of its management 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its future success will be affected by its ability to attract and retain skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
although the company has not experienced difficulty to date  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires to continue to grow and operate profitably 
future capital needs 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  the response of competitors to the products based on the company s technology  and capital necessary for potential acquisitions 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond currently established capabilities will also require further investment 
to the extent that internally generated funds are insufficient to fund the company s operating requirements  it may be necessary for the company to seek additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to the existing shareholders will result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business would be materially adversely affected  and  as a result  the company may be required to curtail its operations significantly
