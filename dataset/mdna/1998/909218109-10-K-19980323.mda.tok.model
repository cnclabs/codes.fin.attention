item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company s loan agreement loan agreement  provides for a total commitment of million  consisting of a revolving credit facility through august  and a term loan thereafter  maturing on august  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to a borrowing base which is subject to a semi annual redetermination 
the latest borrowing base determination indicated million of the commitment is available to the company 
the loan agreement contains certain covenants which require the company to maintain consolidated net worth of at least million  a modified current ratio of not less than to  a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to and a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to in addition  working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
at december   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million 
at february   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million with million available for future borrowings 
the interest rate on the bank debt was and percent at december  and february   respectively 
at the company s election  any portion of the debt outstanding may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate for   or days with the remainder of the outstanding debt subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  the company may not pay in part or in whole the outstanding principal balance of the note to which such libor rate option applies 
at both december  and february   million of borrowings were subject to the libor rate 
a commitment fee of of percent is charged for any unused portion of the borrowing base 
shareholders equity at december  was million  making the company s ratio of long term debt to equity 
to the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources in the near and long term will consist of cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under the company s loan agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million as compared to million in at december  and january   the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures during were million including the hickman drilling company acquisition 
the company s oil and natural gas operations had capital expenditures of million  with million and million used for exploration and development drilling and producing property acquisitions  respectively 
capital expenditures made by the company s contract drilling operations were million in the company is reviewing the feasibility of expanding its contract drilling operations outside the continental united states  specifically into areas of south america 
this review is at a preliminary stage and the company is unable to state whether or when it might undertake such operations 
the company has not previously conducted international contract drilling operations  but in anticipates that such operations would involve a number of additional political  economic  currency  tax and other risks and costs not generally encountered in its domestic operations 
on november   the company acquired hickman drilling company  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  dated november  entered into by and between the company  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company the selling stockholders 
under the terms of this acquisition  the selling stockholders received  in aggregate   shares of common stock and promissory notes to be issued in the aggregate principal amount of  subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement  to be paid in five equal annual installments commencing january  the acquisition included nine land contract drilling rigs with depth capacities ranging from  to  feet  spare drilling equipment and approximately million in working capital 
the notes bear interest at the chase prime rate which at december  and february  was percent 
in december  the company also purchased a mid continent u a  horsepower rig with a  feet depth capacity and spare components from two additional rigs for a total consideration of million  of which  was paid at closing and the balance to be paid out over a period ending no later than three years 
the balance is to be paid out monthly with the monthly amount to be calculated on the basis of a predetermined daily rate multiplied by the number of days in such month that the acquired rig is employed for the account of the seller  all as more fully specified in the acquisition agreement 
if the balance of the purchase price has not been fully paid at the end of three years the remaining amount is to be paid in cash to the seller 
the remainder of the company s drilling capital expenditures in were for drill pipe and collars  the refurbishment of one drilling rig previously stacked and major overhauls on large rig components of drilling rigs in service 
the company s drilling rigs are composed of large components some of which  on a rotational basis  are required to be overhauled to assure continued proper performance 
such capital expenditures will continue in future years with approximately million projected for during  the company s oil and natural gas subsidiary plans to continue its focus on its developmental drilling as increased spot market natural gas prices in late and through lessened the availability of economical producing property acquisitions 
the majority of the company s capital expenditures are discretionary and primarily directed toward increasing reserves and future growth 
current operations are not dependent on the company s ability to obtain funds outside of the company s loan agreement 
the decision to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties at any given time depends on market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing given the circumstances involved  thus providing the company with a large degree of flexibility in incurring such costs 
depending  in part  on commodity pricing  the company plans to spend approximately million on its exploration capital expenditure program in prior to  the company had million warrants outstanding 
during  before the warrants expiration on august   million warrants were exercised providing million in additional capital to the company 
during  the company continued to receive monthly payments on behalf of itself and other parties collectively the committed interest from a natural gas purchaser pursuant to a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
per the settlement agreement these monthly payments ended at december  the monthly payments paid by the purchaser for natural gas not taken the prepayment balance were subject to recoupment in volumes of natural gas through a period ending on the earlier of recoupment or december  the recoupment period 
if natural gas was taken during a month  the value of such natural gas taken was credited toward the monthly amount the purchaser was required to pay 
in the event the purchaser took volumes of natural gas valued in excess of its monthly payment obligations  the value taken in excess was applied to reduce any then outstanding prepayment balance 
as a result of the settlement agreement  the december  prepayment balance of million is payable in equal annual payments over a five year period with the first payment due june  at december   the settlement agreement and the natural gas purchase contracts which were subject to the settlement agreement terminated 
the price per mcf under the settlement agreement was substantially higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of the higher price received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the natural gas previously subject to the settlement agreement will now be sold at spot market prices consistent with primarily all of the rest of the natural gas sold by the company 
oil and natural gas prices received by the company were volatile throughout average oil and natural gas prices received by the company in january  as compared to december  dropped by percent and percent  respectively 
the company s average price received for oil during was and the average natural gas price was 
average oil prices and natural gas spot prices received in march were down and percent  respectively  when compared with december  average prices 
oil prices within the industry remain largely dependent upon world market developments for crude oil 
prices for natural gas are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  and by world wide oil price levels 
any significant drop in spot market natural gas prices would have an adverse effect on the value of the company s reserves and further large drops in prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties 
likewise  declines in natural gas or oil prices could adversely effect the company operationally by  for example  adversely impacting future demand for its drilling rigs or financially by reducing the price received for its oil and natural gas sales and also by adversely effecting the semi annual borrowing base determination under the company s loan agreement since this determination is calculated on the value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
the company does not currently hedge against fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  nor does the company currently maintain any forward or future contracts relating to the production of its oil and natural gas 
as a result of the depressed condition existing in the contract drilling industry over the past decade  the company s ability to utilize its full complement of drilling rigs during the recent increase in drilling activity has been limited due to the lack of qualified labor and certain support equipment not only within the company  but in the industry as a whole 
the company s ability to utilize its drilling rigs at any given time is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and the company s ability to supply the type of equipment required 
although the company currently does not have a shortage of rig support equipment  the company s management expects that these factors will continue to influence the company s rig utilization during in the third quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock on the open market 
since that time   shares have been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
during the first quarters of  and    and  of the purchased shares  respectively  were reissued as the company s matching contribution to its k employee thrift plan 
at december    treasury shares were held by the company 
on april   the company completed a business combination between the company s natural gas marketing operations and a third party also involved in natural gas marketing activities forming a new company called ged gas services  llc ged 
the company owns a percent interest in ged 
effective november   ged sold its natural gas marketing operations to a third party 
this sale removed the company from the third party natural gas marketing business 
the creation of ged and its subsequent sale of its marketing operations did not adversely affect the company s drilling and oil and natural gas exploration operations or the profitability of the company as a whole 
the discontinuation of the company s natural gas marketing segment was accounted for as a discontinued operation and accordingly  the and prior year financial information reflect this treatment 
the company has reviewed the impact of the year software conversion as it relates to the company s information systems 
based on this review  the company believes the financial costs associated with this issue  including internal programming and implementation cost  will not be material 
the work needed to implement the necessary changes will be performed by the company s information systems personnel during the last half of and is scheduled to be effective january  effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations in previous years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of and throughout as drilling rig day rates and drilling rig utilization has increased  the impact of inflation has intensified as the availability of related equipment  third party services and qualified labor has decreased 
the impact on the company in the future will depend on the relative increase  if any  the company may realize in its drilling rig rates and the selling price of its oil and natural gas 
if industry activity continues to increase substantially  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor will occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in material and labor costs 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  in increases in rig utilization  contract drilling day rates  average natural gas prices received and natural gas production from new wells drilled during the year all combined to produce the increase in net income 
oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent increase in natural gas production and average natural gas prices received  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a percent decline in oil production and a percent decrease in average oil prices received by the company in oil production declined from levels due to the company s emphasis over the past two years in drilling development wells which focused on replacing and increasing natural gas reserves 
average natural gas spot market prices received by the company increased percent while volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement  which ended at december  and contained provisions for prices higher than current spot market prices  dropped percent 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately  and  in and  respectively 
in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in  and daywork revenues per rig per day increased percent 
during the first three quarters of  the company s monthly rig utilization consistently remained above rigs with daywork revenue per rig per day steadily climbing by percent 
in october utilization dropped slightly below rigs before the company acquired rigs through the hickman acquisition in late november and another rig in december  raising the company s rig count to rigs and its utilization in december to rigs 
daywork revenue per rig per day continued to rise in the fourth quarter  but the company s average dayrate declined percent in december compared to november since the acquired rigs  due to their depth capabilities  earned lower dayrates 
total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in increased operating margins resulted primarily from the increase in natural gas production and the increase in natural gas prices received by the company between the two years 
total operating costs were percent lower in compared to operating margins for contract drilling increased from percent in to percent in margins in improved due to increases in daily rig rates and utilization 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization 
total costs are expected to increase in due to a higher number of rigs expected to be utilized in contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization and additional drilling capital expenditures throughout depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent and the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel increased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs and outside services increased 
interest expense decreased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt decreased from percent in to percent in average bank debt also decreased percent during prior to  the company s effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by its net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carryforwards were fully recognized for financial reporting purposes  therefore  the company s effective income tax rate in and increased to approximately the statutory rate 
versus net income for was  compared with  in increased natural gas production from new wells drilled along with higher oil and natural gas prices  contract drilling day rates and rig utilization all combined to produce the large increase in net income 
net income in included  gain from the sale of natural gas compressors and certain related support equipment which were sold for million in the first quarter and by the receipt of  in the third quarter from a settlement reached by two of the company s subsidiaries in certain litigation brought against the federal deposit insurance corporation and other parties 
in the fourth quarter of  the company also recognized a  net gain from the company s interest in the sale of ged s gas marketing operations and a  income tax benefit 
net income in the fourth quarter of was reduced by a  write down of certain rig components as the company elected to take of its drilling rigs out of service 
oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent increase in natural gas production combined with a and percent increase in average oil and natural gas prices received by the company  respectively 
oil production remained virtually unchanged from levels 
average natural gas spot market prices received by the company increased by percent while volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement  which contains provisions for prices which are higher than current spot market prices  dropped by percent 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately and million in and  respectively

total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in increased operating margins resulted primarily from the increase in natural gas production and the increases in both oil and natural gas prices received by the company between the two years 
total operating costs increased percent primarily due to the additional costs associated with oil and natural gas production from new wells drilled in operating margins for contract drilling increased from percent in to percent in margins in improved due to increases in daily rig rates and utilization 
margins in were limited by initial start up costs incurred in the first quarter of to establish rigs in the south texas basin and by unusually wet weather conditions during the second quarter of which delayed rig moves and depressed rig utilization 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel declined from in to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs increased between the comparative years 
interest expense decreased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease in average interest rate was partially offset by an percent increase in bank debt outstanding in primarily due to the financing of new wells drilled and the additional rigs and drill pipe purchased during
