wireless alliance began its operations in november and was included in fourth quarter operations acquisition effective may   the company consummated the announced acquisition of the maine wireless telephone operations and related assets of unity cellular systems  inc and related cellular and microwave licenses from intercel  inc 
the company operates its maine operations through a wholly owned subsidiary  mrcc 
the acquired licenses cover the bangor  maine msa and maine rsa which includes augusta  the state capitol 
in addition  the company acquired intercel s interest in the northern maine cellular partnership  which holds a cellular license for maine rsa the company also acquired the remaining in northern maine from an unrelated third party for approximately million 
headquartered in bangor  mrcc serves more than  wireless customers within a  square mile service area that encompasses approximately  pops 
joint venture on august   the company and aerial communications  inc  formerly apt minneapolis  inc  announced the signing of a letter of intent to establish a joint venture named wireless alliance  llc 
wireless alliance will construct and operate personal communications services pcs networks in duluth  virginia and hibbing minnesota  fargo and grand forks  north dakota  superior  wisconsin and sioux falls  south dakota  pops 
prior to completion of the pcs build out  wireless alliance has been reselling cellular service to its  customers 
as pcs service becomes available during  customers will be given a dual mode phone service strategy as an alternative to their existing cellular service 
wireless alliance is percent owned by the company and percent owned by aerial communications  inc the company is responsible for managing wireless alliance 
of the million total investment  as of december   the company has contributed million towards its percent ownership while apt has contributed million in pcs licenses 
in addition  the company has contributed million in excess of its percent ownership  which is reflected as a note receivable from wireless alliance eliminated in consolidation 
general the company s principal operating objective is to increase revenues and achieve profitability through the acquisition and development of new cellular and digital markets and increased penetration in existing markets 
its total market encompasses million pops 
the company has continued to penetrate its existing minnesota markets through innovative sales initiatives 
however  the development of the wireless alliance cellular reselling program and the customers added through the acquisition of mrcc were the primary factors in the company s increased revenues in fiscal total customers increased to  in as compared to  in offsetting the increase in customers was a decrease in the average monthly revenue per customer from in to in the company believes that this decrease reflects an industry wide trend of adding lower usage customers  who use cellular service for personal convenience  security or as an alternative communication resource for their traditional landline telephone service 
the company intends to pursue acquisitions to the extent they enhance or extend its network or increase shareholder value although there can be no assurance any such acquisition will be consummated 
the company emphasizes customer support in an effort to maximize its customer retention 
for the year ended december   the company experienced an average monthly retention rate of  as compared to an industry average monthly retention rate of  as reported in the ctia data survey dated november  customer retention continues to be a challenge as the company s customer base grows and competition increases 
however  the company believes that it will continue to maintain relatively high retention rates due in part to its territory manager distribution philosophy and by offering communication service packages and value added features anticipating customer needs and by providing high quality and knowledgeable customer service 
the company s revenues consist of charges to customers for cellular and paging service  roaming revenues and equipment sales 
service revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by the company s customers and cellular and paging equipment lease revenues 
in addition  other charges include activation and feature charges for such features as voice mail  call waiting  and call forwarding 
roaming revenues consist of airtime  long distance and service fees charged for providing service to customers of other cellular systems that place or receive a call within the company s cellular service area 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer  or the intercarrier exchange rate  is determined by an agreement between the company and the roamer s cellular carrier 
the company has reciprocal agreements with cellular licensees in adjacent cellular service areas that allow the company to provide service to its customers calling from or receiving calls in these territories at favorable rates 
the company believes that roaming revenues will continue to increase as a result of an increase in both the number of roaming customers and roaming minutes of use as the cellular industry matures 
the company believes these increases will more than offset an expected decline in intercarrier exchange rates 
equipment sales consist of cellular and paging equipment and accessory sales to customers 
within certain markets  the company rents equipment to customers in order to reduce the customers perception that the cost of purchasing cellular service is prohibitive 
this program may negatively affect equipment sales  however  its influence is lessened by other equipment sales programs initiated in newly acquired markets 
operating income before depreciation and amortization ebitda increased to million in as compared to million in industry analysts consider ebitda a meaningful measure of an entity s ability to meet long term financial obligations and growth in ebitda a meaningful reflection of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as cellular telecommunications

the company will continue to construct additional cell sites and purchase cellular equipment in order to increase capacity as customer and usage volumes increase 
specific capital requirements of the company are based on the property  equipment  and network facilities requirements associated with the company s acquisition and expansion strategy and rate of customer growth 
the company currently estimates that it will spend approximately million for network expansion during while the company believes it will be able to borrow from third parties the amounts required to continue its network expansion  there can be no assurance that it can do so at acceptable terms

paul bank for cooperatives 
the company is currently negotiating with a commercial lending institution for a new revolving credit facility 
the purpose of the facility will be to acquire the assets of atlantic cellular systems  inc and western maine cellular  inc  for wireless alliance pcs investment requirements  and for other general corporate purposes 
other matters inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant 
year issue the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
during fiscal  the company did not incur any cost to modify existing computer systems and applications  and estimates that approximately  will be incurred in and the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
if year modifications are not properly completed either by the company or its vendors  banks or any other entities with whom the company conducts business  the company could be adversely impacted 
subsequent event on february   the company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the net assets of atlantic cellular  lp atlantic for approximately million 
the cellular properties to be acquired from atlantic include the entire state of vermont rsa  rsa and the burlington metropolitan statistical area  western new hampshire rsa  the northeastern corner of new york rsa  and northwestern massachusetts rsa on february   the company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase western maine cellular wmc  a wholly owned subsidiary of utilities  inc for approximately million 
the cellular properties provide service to western maine rsa 
long term financing to support both the purchases of atlantic and wmc has been arranged through toronto dominion bank  which has also acted as a financial advisor to the company seasonality the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income loss 
the company s average monthly revenue per cellular customer has historically increased during the second and third calendar quarters 
this increase reflects greater usage by the company s cellular customers and roamers who travel in the company s cellular service area for weekend and vacation recreation or work in seasonal industries  such as agriculture and construction 
because the company s cellular service area includes many seasonal recreational areas  the company expects that roaming revenues will continue to fluctuate seasonally more than service revenues
