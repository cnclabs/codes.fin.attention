newsedge subscriptions are generally for an initial term of twelve months  payable in advance  and are automatically renewable for successive one year periods unless the customer delivers notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the then current agreement 
newsedge subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term  beginning on installation of the newsedge service 
accordingly  a substantial portion of the company s revenues is recorded as deferred revenues until they are recognized over the license term 
the company does not capitalize customer acquisition costs 
certain newswires offered by the company through newsedge are purchased by the customer directly from the news provider and payments are made directly from the newsedge customer to the provider 
for some of these newswires  the company receives ongoing royalties on payments made by the customer to the news provider  and those royalties constitute part of the company s subscription and royalty revenues

despite the company s profitability in and  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the net deferred tax asset 
the uncertainty is due to the mechanism required for utilizing net operating less carryforwards nols and tax credit carryforwards  as well as the company s history of cumulative losses since inception of million as of december  the company has significant nols from disqualifying dispositions and tax credit carryforwards tccs primarily from research and development activities 
the company is required to first use the nols including nols generated from disqualifying dispositions prior to realizing any benefit from the tccs  thus extending the time as to when the tccs can be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources on august   the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock  which provided the company with net proceeds of approximately  prior to the initial public offering  the company funded its operations primarily from cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock

the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and funds anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
subsequent events on february   the company merged with individual to form newsedge corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  shares of the company were exchanged for all outstanding shares  options and warrants of individual  inc on the basis of one share of individual  inc common stock for one half of one share of the company s common stock 
as of december   newsedge corporation had million in total assets on a pro forma combined basis  including million in cash and short term investments 
the company expects to incur a charge of approximately million to million in the first quarter of related to integration of operations  asset write downs  personnel reduction and other one time merger related charges 
the integration of the business of individual requires  among other things  integration of the companies respective service offerings and coordination of the companies sales  marketing and research and development efforts 
historically  the sales models used by both companies sales organizations have differed significantly  although each employs direct sales personnel 
as compared to the company  pre merger  individual s product line traditionally experienced a shorter sales cycle and its sales model relied more heavily on telesales 
there can be no assurance that the company can take full advantage of the combined sales force s efforts 
the companies have also used a number of distribution channels in the various geographic markets in which their respective products are sold and there can be no assurance that channel conflict will not develop as the company attempts to integrate these channels 
the success of the integration process will be significantly influenced by the ability of the company to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and research and development personnel 
there is no assurance that the foregoing will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the integration of operations requires the dedication of management resources  which may distract attention from the day to day operations of the company 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of the companies may have a material adverse effect upon the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
see certain factors affecting future operating results for additional risks associated with the merger 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
uncertainties relating to integration of operations the company entered into the agreement and plan of merger and organization with individual  inc individual on november   with the expectation that the merger will result in long term strategic benefits 
these anticipated benefits will depend in part on whether the companies operations can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner 
there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the combination of the companies requires  among other things  integration of the companies respective service offerings and coordination of the companies sales  marketing and research and development efforts 
historically  the sales models used by the company and individual have differed significantly 
while the company sold principally to the enterprise market utilizing a direct sales force  individual addressed the three tiers of the market with a distribution strategy that utilized a direct sales force at the enterprise level  telesales to workgroups  and an internet distribution model that incorporated world wide web web banner advertising  marketing relationships with a number of high traffic web sites and agreements with internet service providers to capture the individual knowledge worker 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to take full advantage of the combined sales force s efforts 
the company and individual also used a number of distribution channels in certain overseas markets in which products are sold and there can be no assurance that channel conflicts will not develop as the company attempts to integrate these channels 
the services of the company rely on the timely collection  processing and distribution of news and information to enterprises and individuals around the world 
while the company intends to take precautions to maintain service levels  there can be no assurances that the combination of operations centers will not cause service interruptions or performance degradation of the company s services 
should significant service disruptions occur  customer retention  revenues  and service and support costs of the company could be materially adversely affected 
the success of the integration process will be significantly influenced by the ability of the company to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and research and development personnel 
there is no assurance that the foregoing will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the current integration of operations requires the dedication of management resources  which may distract attention from the day to day operations of the company 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of the companies could have a material adverse effect upon the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
history of operating losses individual was incorporated in january and introduced its initial service  first  in march since its inception  individual incurred substantial costs to develop and enhance its technology  to create  introduce  and enhance its service offerings  to establish marketing and distribution relationships  to recruit and train a sales and marketing group  to acquire customers for its subscription services  and to build an administrative organization 
as a consequence  individual incurred operating losses in each of its fiscal quarters and in each year since inception  including net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   individual had an accumulated deficit on a stand alone basis of approximately million 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the individual business will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
the failure of the individual business to achieve profitability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
costs and expenses of integration the company estimates that it  and individual incurred direct transaction costs of approximately million to million associated with the merger  substantially all of which will be charged to operations of the company in the first quarter of the company expects to incur an additional significant charge to operations of approximately million to million  in the first quarter of  related to integration of operations  asset write downs  personnel reduction and other one time merger related charges 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the merger 
effects of merger on customers there can be no assurance that the present and potential customers of the company will continue their current buying patterns without regard to the merger 
any significant delay or reduction in orders could have an adverse effect on the near term business and results of operations of the company 
in addition  uncertainties regarding product overlap of the companies respective services and resolution of that overlap may cause customers to delay purchasing decisions regarding these products 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results may in the future fluctuate significantly depending on factors such as demand for its services  changes in service mix  the size and timing of new and renewal subscriptions from corporate customers  advertising revenue levels  the effects of new service announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced versions of its services on a timely basis and the level of product and price competition 
a substantial portion of the company s cost of revenue  which consists principally of fees payable to information providers  telecommunications costs and personnel expenses  is relatively fixed in nature 
the operating expense levels of the company are based  in significant part  on their expectations of future revenue 
if quarterly revenues are below management s expectations  results of operations would be adversely affected because a relatively small amount of the company s costs and expenses will vary with its revenues 
future operating results uncertain the company s ability to increase its revenues will depend upon its ability to expand its sales force  to increase sales to new customers as well as increase penetration into existing customers  and to integrate the company s product offerings under a single brand 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of the company s pre merger  individual s or the company s post merger results of operations are not and will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
although each of the company and individual experienced growth in revenues in recent years  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will sustain revenue growth or be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
dependence on continued growth in use of the internet although individual  and now the company  distributes certain products and services across multiple delivery platforms  including facsimile  electronic mail  and private networks based on lotus notes and other groupware products  sales of certain of individual s products and services  such as newspage and clarinews  depend upon the adoption of the internet as a widely used medium for commerce and communication 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon 
there can be no assurance that communication or commerce over the internet will become widespread or that extensive content will continue to be provided over the internet 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development and commercialization of performance improvements  including high speed modems 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it by such potential growth or that the performance or reliability of the web will not be adversely affected by this continued growth 
the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the web and the company s online services 
if the necessary infrastructure or complementary services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
reliance on advertising revenues and uncertainty of web as advertising medium the internet is an unproven medium for paid advertising sponsorship of web based services such as individual s  and now the company s  newspage and clarinews services 
subscriptions to these web based services are partially subsidized by revenues from the sale of advertisements on the web pages of such services 
most of the company s advertising customers have only limited experience with the web as an advertising medium  have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to web based advertising and may not find such advertising to be effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional print and broadcast media 
the company s ability to generate significant advertising revenues to subsidize subscriptions to its web based services will depend upon  among other things  advertisers acceptance of the web as an effective and sustainable advertising medium  the development of a large base of users of the company s services possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  and the ability of the company to develop and update effective advertising delivery and measurement systems 
no standards have yet been widely accepted for the measurement of the effectiveness of web based advertising  and there can be no assurance that such standards will develop sufficiently to support web based advertising as a significant advertising medium 
in addition  there is intense competition in the sale of advertising on the internet  which has resulted in a wide range of rates quoted by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  which makes it difficult to project future levels of internet advertising revenues that will be realized generally or by any specific company 
competition among current and future web sites  as well as competition with other traditional media for advertising placements  could result in significant price competition and reductions in advertising revenues 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that individual will sustain or increase current advertising sales levels 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel competition for qualified sales  technical and other qualified personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees in the future 
if the company is unable to hire and retain such personnel  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
success of the integration process following the merger and future financial success also depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
additions of new  and departures of existing  personnel  particularly in key positions  can be disruptive and can result in departures of existing personnel  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the business information services industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and the entry into the field of extremely large and well capitalized companies as well as smaller competitors 
the company will compete or may compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies i large  well established news and information providers such as the dialog corporation  dow jones  bridge  lexis nexis  pearson  reuters and thomson  ii market data services companies such as adp  bloomberg and telerate  iii traditional print media companies that are increasingly searching for opportunities for on line provision of news  including through the establishment of world wide web sites on the internet  iv large providers of lan based and internet based software systems such as ibm lotus  netscape and microsoft  which could  in the future  ally with competing news and information providers  and v single user  advertising subsidized web based services and internet access providers 
many of these companies and market participants not named above have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
increased competition  on the basis of price or otherwise  may require price reductions or increased spending on marketing or software development  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to acquisitions individual  pre merger  recently completed the acquisition of clarinet communications corp  and the company may acquire other companies  products or technologies in the future 
there can be no assurance that these acquisitions can be effectively integrated  that such acquisitions will not result in costs or liabilities that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition  or that the company will obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such transactions 
management may from time to time consider acquisitions of assets or businesses that it believes may enable the company to obtain complementary skills and capabilities  offer new products  expand its customer base or obtain other competitive advantages 
such acquisitions involve potential risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  technology  products and personnel  completing and integrating acquired in process technology  diverting management s resources  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new employees and customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
dependence on cooperative marketing arrangements the company has entered into certain cooperative marketing agreements and informal arrangements with software vendors  web site sponsors and operators of on line services  including microsoft  netscape and netcom 
these companies presently market services that compete directly with those of the company 
if the company s marketing activities with such companies were terminated  reduced  curtailed  or otherwise modified  the company may not be able to replace or supplement such efforts alone or with others 
if these companies were to develop and market their own business information services or those of the company s competitors  the company s business and results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
litigation risks a class action shareholder suit was filed against individual  certain of its directors and officers and the underwriters of its initial public offering claiming that the defendants made misstatements  or failed to make statements  to the investing public in individual s prospectus and registration statement relating to its initial public offering  as well as in subsequent public disclosures  relating to the alleged existence of disputes between joseph a 
amram  individual s former chief executive officer  and individual now the company 
the company believes that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against the claims  and based upon information currently available  believes that the action will not have a material impact on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that this litigation will ultimately be resolved on terms that are favorable to the company and that the resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on news providers a significant percentage of the company s customers subscribe to services provided by one or more of press association inc  a subsidiary of the associated press  dow jones  the financial times  reuters and thompson 
the company s agreements with news providers are generally for terms of one to three years  with automatic renewal unless notice of termination is provided before the end of the term by either party 
these agreements may also be terminated by the provider if the company fails to fulfill its obligations under the agreement 
many of these news and information providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with the company 
termination of one or more significant news provider agreements would decrease the news and information which the company can offer its customers and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
also  an increase in the fees required to be paid by the company to its information providers would have an adverse effect on the company s gross margins and results of operations 
because the company licenses the informational content included in its services from third parties  the company s exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed content and generally obtain indemnification for any breach thereof  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that indemnification will adequately compensate the company for any breach 
dependence on news transmission sources the company s news and information for the newsedge products is transmitted using one or more of three methods leased telephone lines  satellites or fm radio transmission 
none of these methods of news transmission is within the control of the company  and the loss or significant disruption of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
many newswire providers have established their own broadcast communications networks using one or more of these three vehicles 
in these cases  the company s role is to arrange communications between the news provider and the newsedge customer s server 
for sources which do not have their own broadcast communications capability  news and information is delivered to the company news consolidation facility  where it is reformatted for broadcast to newsedge servers and retransmitted to customers through an arrangement between the company and wavephore wavephore  a common carrier communications vendor 
wavephore presently markets services that compete directly with those of the company 
wavephore is also the communications provider for many newswires offered by the company through newsedge 
the company s agreement with wavephore expires on december  this agreement can be terminated earlier in the event of a material breach by the company of the agreement 
if the agreement with wavephore were terminated on short notice  or if wavephore were to encounter technical or financial difficulties adversely affecting its ability to continue to perform under the agreement or otherwise  the company s business would be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that if wavephore were unable to fulfill its obligations  other sources of retransmission would be available to the company  although the transition from wavephore to those sources could result in delays or interruptions of service that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk of system failure or inadequacy the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
although the company will have limited back up capability  this measure does not eliminate the significant risk to the company s operations from a natural disaster or system failure at its principal site 
in addition  any failure or delay in the timely transmission or receipt of feeds and computer downloads from its information providers  whether on account of system failure of the information providers  the public network or otherwise  could disrupt the company s operations 
risks relating to year issues because the company s software and services are not date sensitive or date dependent  the company believes that its software and services are substantially year compliant and currently does not anticipate material expenditures to remedy any year problems 
however  many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  and therefore  many companies will be required to modify their computer hardware and software prior to the year in order to remain functional 
many enterprises  including the company s present and potential customers  will be devoting a substantial portion of their information systems spending to resolving this upcoming year problem  which may result in spending being diverted from network applications  such as the company s products  over the next two years 
additionally  the company utilizes third party computer and telecommunications equipment to distribute its products as well as to operate other aspects of its business  and there can be no assurances that such equipment is year compliant 
although the company intends to take measures to address the impact  if any  of year issues  failure of any critical equipment to operate properly in the year may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition or require the company to incur unanticipated material expenses to remedy any problem 
rapid technological change the business information services  software and communications industries are subject to rapid technological change  which may render existing products and services obsolete or require significant unanticipated investments in research and development 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its service offerings and keep pace with technological developments 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing services  to develop new products and services that address the needs of its customers and to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices  each on a timely basis 
services as complex as those offered by the company entail significant technical risks  often encounter development delays and may result in service failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
any such delays in development or failures that occur after commercial introduction of new or enhanced services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology the company is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights in its software and technology 
there can be no assurance that such measures are or will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies or services 
individual licensed the proprietary smart filtering software  which is used as the filtering engine for all of its products and services  from cornell research foundation  inc cornell university 
under the terms of the license agreement with cornell university  individual  and now the company  has exclusive worldwide rights until february to design  develop  market  and sell systems and services based on the smart software for the retrieval and dissemination of data from recent and continually changing data sources 
provided that the company is not then in default of the license agreement  at the end of the initial term of the agreement the company will retain a continuing worldwide  non exclusive  perpetual royalty free right to use the smart software  and in addition  the company owns  and will continue to own  all enhancements to the smart software that it has developed 
there can be no assurance  however  that cornell university will not license the smart software to a third party  including a competitor of the company  once the company s exclusive rights have lapsed 
in addition  cornell university may terminate the license agreement if the company has materially breached the agreement and such breach remains uncured for days after written notice of such breach has been given 
if the license agreement were to terminate  the company could be required to develop or acquire a replacement filtering technology  and there can be no assurance that such technology could be developed or acquired  on a timely basis or at all  and on favorable terms to the company 
consequently  any termination of the company s license agreement with cornell university would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
there has been substantial litigation in the information services industry involving intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that it is not infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  inasmuch as the company licenses the informational content that is included in its services from third parties  its exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed informational content and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representations 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights of the company 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any such litigation would be costly and divert management s attention  either of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent the company from selling its services  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition
