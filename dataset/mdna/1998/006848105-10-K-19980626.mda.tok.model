cable television operations products and services video services cable television systems receive a variety of television  radio and data signals transmitted to receiving sites headends by way of off air antennas  microwave relay systems and satellite earth stations 
signals are then modulated  amplified and distributed primarily through fiber optic and coaxial cable to subscribers  who pay fees for the service 
cable television systems are generally constructed and operated pursuant to non exclusive franchises awarded by state or local government authorities for specified periods of time 
cable television systems typically offer subscribers a package of basic video services consisting of local and distant television broadcast signals  satellite delivered non broadcast channels which offer programming such as news  sports  family entertainment  music  weather  shopping  etc 
and public  governmental and educational access channels 
in addition  premium service channels  which provide movies  live and taped concerts  sports events and other programming  are offered for an extra monthly charge 
systems also offer pay per view programming  which allows the subscriber to order special events or movies and to pay on a per event basis 
local  regional and national advertising time is sold in the majority of the systems  with commercial advertisements inserted on certain satellite delivered non broadcast channels 
digital video services are now available to adelphia subscribers who lease or purchase a digital converter 
digital tv is a computerized method of defining  transmitting and storing information that makes up a television signal 
since digital signals can be compressed  adelphia can transmit up to channels in the space currently used to transmit just one analog channel 
digital tv converters are available to approximately of adelphia s customers 
adelphia s digital tv subscribers may also receive multichannel premium services  such as hbo   and from east and west coast satellite feeds  enhanced pay per view options with movie channels  up to channels of cd quality music from music choice and an interactive on screen program guide to help them navigate the new digital choices 
high speed data services power link  the company s high speed data service provided through cable modems  which includes residential  institutional  and business service offerings  constitutes an alternative to the traditional slower speed data offerings available through internet service providers isps 
power link offers customers speeds greater than those available through a t line  at costs that compare to a typical isp plus a second telephone line 
the company s deep fiber design allows the use of the expanded bandwidth potential of digital compression technology for cable data and video services 
high speed cable data services are now available at speeds far in excess of that which is currently available via a kilobit per second telephone modem 
in addition  using a high speed cable modem and special ethernet card allows the user to bypass telephone lines  does not require the user to log on  and allows for multiple sessions or connections to multiple services simultaneously 
the company also offers high speed internet access through the use of one way cable modems  which provide the high speeds of broadband on the data downstream and utilize a telephone line return path 
one way cable modems enable the company to offer the high speed data service to of its customers  while completing the system buildout of two way broadband plant 
the company also offers traditional dial up internet access for those customers who initially prefer this method of internet access to the higher speeds of our broadband network 
this establishes the company as a full service internet provider and creates a customer base which can be upgraded to the high speed service in the future 
other services adelphia offers wireless messaging services through its wholly owned subsidiary  page time  inc page time 
page time provides one way messaging services to the company s systems via resale arrangements with existing paging network operators 
the company plans to offer two way messaging services to its customers beginning in fiscal in july  adelphia began selling long distance telephone service on a resale basis 
services offered include state to state and in state long distance  as well as service  international calling  calling card services and debit card services 
the company s sales effort is focused on the consumer market and emphasizes the simplicity and savings of one low monthly rate available hours a day  days a week 
in addition to the activities described above  the company has made a substantial commitment to technological development as a member of cable television laboratories  inc  a not for profit research and development company serving the cable industry 
operating strategy the company s cable television operations strategy is to construct and operate a broadband network capable of offering a broad range of telecommunications services and providing superior customer service while maximizing operating efficiencies 
the company intends to build on its expertise as a cable television service provider  as well as to become a provider of bundled communications services 
it intends to combine its cable television service with high speed data and internet access  paging and telephony service 
by acquiring and developing systems in geographic proximity  the company has been able to realize significant operating efficiencies through the consolidation of many managerial  administrative and technical functions 
the systems have consolidated virtually all of their administrative operations  including customer service  service call dispatching  marketing  human resources  advertising sales and government relations into regional offices 
each regional office has a related technical center which contains the facilities necessary for the systems technical functions  including construction  installation and system maintenance and monitoring 
consolidating customer service functions into regional offices allows the company to provide customer service through better training and staffing of customer service representatives  and by providing more advanced telecommunications and computer equipment and software to its customer service representatives than would otherwise be economically feasible in smaller systems 
the company considers technological innovation to be an important component of its service offerings and customer satisfaction 
the company intends to continue the upgrade of its network infrastructure to add channel capacity  increase digital transmission capabilities and further improve system reliability 
these improvements will enable the company to continue its introduction of additional services  such as digital video  high speed data and internet service and impulse ordered pay per view programming  which expand customer choices and are expected to increase company revenues 
management believes that the company is among the leaders of the cable industry in the deployment of fiber optic cable with one of the most advanced cable network infrastructures 
hyperion products and services hyperion s products and services are designed to appeal to the sophisticated telecommunications needs of its business  governmental and educational customers 
local services hyperion provides local dial tone services to customers  which allows them to complete calls in their calling area and to access a long distance calling area 
local services and long distance services can be bundled together using the same transport facility 
hyperion s networks are designed to allow a customer to easily increase or decrease capacity and alter enhanced services as the telecommunications requirements of the business change 
in addition to its core local services  hyperion also provides access to third party directory assistance and operator services 
long distance services hyperion provides domestic and international long distance services for completing intrastate  interstate and international calls 
long distance service is offered as an additional service to hyperion s local exchange customers 
long distance calls which do not terminate on hyperion s networks which are currently the bulk of such calls are passed to long distance carriers which route the remaining portion of the call 
enhanced services in addition to providing typical enhanced services such as voicemail  call transfer and conference calling  hyperion offers additional value added enhanced services to complement its core local and long distance services 
these enhanced service offerings include access to internet services  data networking services and specialized application services 
growth strategy hyperion s objective is to be the leading local telecommunications service provider to businesses  governmental and educational end users  vars  isps and ixcs within its markets 
to achieve this objective  hyperion has pursued a regionalized facilities based strategy to provide extensive  high capacity network coverage and to broaden the range of telecommunications products and services it offers to targeted customers 
hyperion provides its services to telecommunications intensive customers which include medium and large businesses  governmental and educational end users  and other telecommunications providers 
management believes that its target customers are a large and under served universe who generally have no choice other than to buy communications services from the incumbent lec or ixc 
these customers generally seek reliability  high quality  broad geographic coverage  end to end service  solutions oriented customer service and timely introduction of new and innovative services 
the company believes it will be able to continue to compete effectively for end users by offering superior reliability  product diversity  service and custom solutions to meet end user needs at competitive prices 
hyperion also offers its local services to ixcs and has entered into national service agreements with at t and mci to be their preferred supplier of dedicated access and switched access transport services 
by providing switched voice  enhanced services and long distance access on its own fiber optic networks  hyperion believes it can better control the provisioning  delivery and monitoring of its services as well as increase its operating margins 
on net services improve the company s ability to provide bundled service offerings by reducing its reliance upon incumbent lecs for servicing and technological upgrades of leased dedicated transport or unbundled network elements 
hyperion currently provides approximately of its switched services to customers on net  though this percentage will decline as the company continues to offer switched services on an unbundled network element and total service resale basis 
however  hyperion believes it will provision a majority of its access lines on its own networks for the foreseeable future 
hyperion believes that a significant portion of business  governmental and educational customers prefer a single source telecommunications provider that delivers a full range of efficient and cost effective solutions to meet their telecommunications needs 
hyperion believes that offering a customized  integrated package of telecommunications services positions it to best address the increasing telecommunications requirements of businesses within its markets 
as a facilities based  single source provider of bundled telecommunications services  hyperion believes it can satisfy the growing telecommunications demands of its customers on a more effective and cost efficient basis than many of its competitors 
recent development of the systems the company has focused on acquiring and developing systems in markets which have favorable historical growth trends 
the company believes that the strong household growth trends in its systems market areas are a key factor in positioning itself for future growth in basic subscribers 
for a description of acquisitions by the company and olympus from april  through the date of this filing  see note to adelphia s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
tci partnership 
on january   adelphia signed a definitive agreement to establish a partnership into which tele communications  inc tci will contribute its cable systems in buffalo  new york  erie  pennsylvania  and ashtabula and lake county  ohio  totaling approximately  subscribers  and adelphia will contribute its western new york and lorain  ohio systems  totaling approximately  subscribers 
upon closing of the transaction  tci will hold a minority interest in the partnership 
adelphia will manage the partnership and will consolidate the partnership s results for financial reporting purposes 
the company expects that the transaction will close prior to september  the company will continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of its business through the acquisition of additional cable television systems in geographic proximity to its existing regional market areas or in locations that can serve as the basis for new market areas  either directly or indirectly through joint ventures  where appropriate 
the following table indicates the growth of the company systems and olympus systems by summarizing the number of homes passed by cable and the number of basic subscribers for each of the five years in the period ended march  the table also indicates the numerical growth in subscribers attributable to acquisitions and the numerical and percentage growth attributable to internal growth

cable television operations technologies and capital improvements the company has made a substantial commitment to the technological development of the systems and is aggressively investing in the upgrade of the technical capabilities of its cable plant in a cost efficient manner 
over of adelphia s networks have bandwidth capacity of mhz or greater 
the company continues to deploy fiber optic cable and to upgrade the technical capabilities of its broadband networks 
the result is significant increases in network capacity  digital capability  two way communication and network reliability 
the design of the current system upgrade  when completed  will deploy on average one fiber optic node for every two system plant miles or approximately one fiber node for every homes passed compared to the industry norm of to homes passed per fiber optic node 
approximately of the system will be upgraded to mhz 
approximately of the plant will remain at mhz 
the upgraded system will be completely addressable and provide two way communication capability 
the additional bandwidth will enable the company to offer additional video programming services 
a portion of the bandwidth will be allocated to the new service offerings such as two way data  telephony and video on demand 
the company believes this combination of bandwidth and the relatively low homes passed per fiber node will provide adequate capacity and flexibility to offer any and all of the existing and anticipated services into the foreseeable future with minimal additional capital expenditures 
by the end of fiscal  approximately of customers will be served by two way cable plant 
the upgraded system  on average  will include only two active pieces of equipment between the headend and the home 
limiting the number of active pieces of equipment combined with the small number of homes per fiber node reduces the potential for mechanical failure and the number of customers affected by such a failure  all of which provides increased reliability to the customers 
subscriber services and rates the company s revenues are derived principally from monthly subscription fees for various services 
rates to subscribers vary in accordance with the type of service selected 
although service offerings vary across franchise areas because of differences in plant capabilities  each of the areas typically offer services at monthly prices ranging as follows service rate range basic cable television cable value cable television premium cable television high speed internet access dial up internet access paging long distance plus 
per minute in addition  the company derives revenue from telephony with rates determined on a usage basis 
an installation fee  which the company may wholly or partially waive during a promotional period  is usually charged to new subscribers 
subscribers are free to terminate services at any time without charge  but often are charged a fee for reconnection or change of service 
the cable communications policy act of the cable act  as amended by the cable act  deregulated basic service rates for systems in communities meeting the federal communication commissions fcc definition of effective competition 
pursuant to the fcc s definition of effective competition adopted following enactment of the cable act  substantially all of the company s franchises were rate deregulated 
however  in june  the fcc amended its effective competition standard  which increased the number of cable systems which could be subject to local rate regulation 
the cable act contains a new definition of effective competition under which nearly all cable systems in the united states are subject to regulation of basic service rates 
additionally  the legislation i eliminated the annual basic rate increase allowed by the cable act without local approval  ii allows the fcc to adjudicate the reasonableness of rates for non basic service tiers  other than premium services  for cable systems not subject to effective competition in response to complaints filed by franchising authorities and or cable subscribers  iii prohibits cable systems from requiring subscribers to purchase service tiers above basic service in order to purchase premium services if the system is technically capable of doing so  iv allows the fcc to impose restrictions on the retiering and rearrangement of cable services under certain circumstances  and v permits the fcc and franchising authorities more latitude in controlling rates and rejecting rate increase requests 
the telecommunications act of the act ends fcc regulation on nonbasic tier rates on march  see legislation and regulation 
for a discussion of recent fcc rate regulation and related developments  see legislation and regulation and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and competitive matters 
franchises the cable act provides that cable operators may not offer cable service to a particular community without a franchise unless such operator was lawfully providing service to the community on july  and the franchising authority does not require a franchise 
the systems operate pursuant to franchises or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities  substantially all of which are nonexclusive 
such franchises or authorizations awarded by a governmental authority generally are not transferable without the consent of the authority 
as of march   the company held franchises  olympus held franchises and the managed systems held franchises 
most of these franchises can be terminated prior to their stated expiration by the relevant governmental authority  after due process  for breach of material provisions of the franchise 
under the terms of most of the company s franchises  a franchise fee generally ranging up to of the gross revenues of the cable system is payable to the governmental authority 
for the past three years  franchise fee expense incurred by the company has averaged approximately of gross system revenues 
the franchises issued by the governmental authorities are subject to periodic renewal 
in renewal hearings  the authorities generally consider  among other things  whether the franchise holder has provided adequate service and complied with the franchise terms 
in connection with a renewal  the authority may impose different and more stringent terms  the impact of which cannot be predicted 
to date  all of the company s material franchises have been renewed or extended  at or effective upon their stated expiration  generally on modified terms 
such modified terms have not been materially adverse to the company 
the company believes that all of its material franchises are in good standing 
from time to time  the company notifies the franchising authorities of the company s intent to seek renewal of the franchise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the cable act 
the cable act process requires that the governmental authority consider the franchise holder s renewal proposal on its own merits in light of the franchise holder s past performance and the community s needs and interests  without regard to the presence of competing applications 
see legislation and regulation 
the cable act alters the administrative process by which operators utilize their cable act franchise renewal rights 
such changes could make it easier in some instances for a franchising authority to deny renewal of a franchise 
hyperion networks network construction the company s networks are constructed to cost effectively access areas of significant end user telecommunications traffic  as well as the pops of most ixcs and the majority of the lec cos 
the company establishes with its local partner general requirements for network design including engineering specifications  fiber type and amount  construction timelines and quality control 
the company s engineering personnel provide project management  including contract negotiation and overall supervision of the construction  testing and certification of all facilities 
the construction period for a new network varies depending upon the number of route miles to be installed  the initial number of buildings targeted for connection to the network  the general deployment of the network and other factors 
networks that the company has installed to date have generally become operational within six to ten months after the beginning of construction 
network operating control center nocc in coudersport  pennsylvania  the company has built the nocc  which is equipped with state of the art system monitoring and control technology 
the nocc is a single point interface for monitoring all of the company s networks and provisioning all services and systems necessary to operate the networks 
the nocc supports all of the company s networks including the management of  building connections  switches or remote switching modules and  network route miles as of march  the nocc is designed to accommodate the company s anticipated growth 
the nocc is utilized for a variety of network management and control functions including monitoring  managing and diagnosing the company s sonet networks  central office equipment  customer circuits and signals and the company s switches and associated equipment 
the nocc is also the location where the company provisions  coordinates  tests and accepts all orders for switched and dedicated circuit orders 
in addition  the nocc maintains the database for the company s circuits and network availability 
network personnel at the nocc also develop and distribute a variety of software utilized to manage and maintain the networks 
connections to customer locations office buildings are connected by network backbone extensions to one of a number of physical rings of fiber optic cable  which originate and terminate at the networks central office 
signals are sent simultaneously on both primary and alternate protection paths through a network backbone to the networks central office 
within each building  network internal wiring connects the networks fiber optic terminal equipment to the customer premises 
customer equipment is connected to network provided electronic equipment generally located where customer transmissions are digitized  combined and converted to an optical signal 
the traffic is then transmitted through the network backbone to the networks central office where it can be reconfigured for routing to its ultimate destination on the network 
cable television operations competition although the company and the cable television industry have historically faced modest competition  the competitive landscape is changing and competition will increase 
the company believes that the increase in competition within its communities will occur gradually over a period of time 
at the present time  cable television systems compete with other communications and entertainment media  including off air television broadcast signals which a viewer is able to receive directly using the viewer s own television set and antenna 
the extent to which a cable system competes with over the air broadcasting depends upon the quality and quantity of the broadcast signals available by direct antenna reception compared to the quality and quantity of such signals and alternative services offered by a cable system 
in many areas  television signals which constitute a substantial part of basic service can be received by viewers who use their own antennas 
local television reception for residents of apartment buildings or other multi unit dwelling complexes may be aided by use of private master antenna services 
cable systems also face competition from alternative methods of distributing and receiving television signals and from other sources of entertainment such as live sporting events  movie theaters and home video products  including videotape recorders and compact disc players 
in recent years  the fcc has adopted policies providing for authorization of new technologies and a more favorable operating environment for certain existing technologies that provide  or may provide  substantial additional competition for cable television systems 
the extent to which cable television service is competitive depends in significant part upon the cable television system s ability to provide an even greater variety of programming and other services than that available off air or through competitive alternative delivery sources 
in addition  certain provisions of the cable act and the act are expected to increase competition significantly in the cable industry 
see legislation and regulation 
the cable act prohibits the award of exclusive franchises  prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises and permits them to operate cable systems themselves without franchises 
individuals presently have the option to purchase earth stations  which allow the direct reception of satellite delivered program services formerly available only to cable television subscribers 
most satellite distributed program signals are being electronically scrambled to permit reception only with authorized decoding equipment  generally at a cost to the viewer 
from time to time  legislation has been introduced in congress which  if enacted into law  would prohibit the scrambling of certain satellite distributed programs or would make satellite services available to private earth stations on terms comparable to those offered to cable systems 
broadcast television signals are being made available to owners of earth stations under the satellite home view copyright act of  which became effective january  for a six year period 
this act establishes a statutory compulsory license for certain transmissions made by satellite owners to home satellite dishes for which carriers are required to pay a royalty fee to the copyright office 
this act has been extended by congress until december  the cable act enhances the right of cable competitors to purchase nonbroadcast satellite delivered programming 
see legislation and regulation federal regulation 
video programming is now being delivered to individuals by high powered direct broadcast satellites dbs utilizing video compression technology 
this technology has the capability of providing more than channels of programming over a single high powered dbs satellite with significantly higher capacity available if multiple satellites are placed in the same orbital position 
video compression technology is being used by cable operators to similarly increase their channel capacity 
dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small rooftop or side mounted antenna  and it is more accessible than cable television service where a cable plant has not been constructed or where it is not cost effective to construct cable television facilities 
dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nationwide basis by several service providers 
one dbs service provider is proposing to deliver at least some local television stations via satellite  thus lessening the distinction between cable television and dbs service 
cable communications systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multichannel  multipoint distribution service mmds  commonly called wireless cable systems  which use low power microwave frequencies to transmit video programming over the air to subscribers 
there are mmds operators who are authorized to provide or are providing broadcast and satellite programming to subscribers in areas served by the company s systems 
mmds systems are less capital intensive  are not required to obtain local franchises or to pay franchise fees and are subject to fewer regulatory requirements than cable television systems 
mmds systems ability to compete with cable television systems has previously been limited by channel capacity  the inability to obtain programming and regulatory delays 
recently  however  mmds systems have developed digital compression technology which provides for more channel capacity and better signal delivery 
although relatively few mmds systems in the united states are currently in operation or under construction  virtually all markets have been licensed or tentatively licensed 
a series of actions taken by the fcc  including reallocating certain frequencies to wireless services  are intended to facilitate the development of wireless cable television spectrum that will be used by wireless operators to provide additional channels of programming over longer distances 
several regional bell operating companies acquired interests in major mmds companies 
the company is unable to predict whether wireless video services will have a material impact on its operations 
additional competition may come from private cable television systems servicing condominiums  apartment complexes and certain other multiple unit residential developments 
the operators of these private systems  known as satellite master antenna television smatv systems  often enter into exclusive agreements with apartment building owners or homeowners associations which preclude franchised cable television operators from serving residents of such private complexes 
however  the cable act gives franchised cable operators the right to use existing compatible easements within their franchise areas upon nondiscriminatory terms and conditions 
accordingly  where there are preexisting compatible easements  cable operators may not be unfairly denied access or discriminated against with respect to the terms and conditions of access to those easements 
there have been conflicting judicial decisions interpreting the scope of the access right granted by the cable act  particularly with respect to easements located entirely on private property 
further  while a franchised cable television system typically is obligated to extend service to all areas of a community regardless of population density or economic risk  a smatv system may confine its operation to small areas that are easy to serve and more likely to be profitable 
under the act  smatv systems can interconnect non commonly owned buildings without having to comply with local  state and federal regulatory requirements that are imposed upon cable systems providing similar services  as long as they do not use public rights of way 
the us copyright office has concluded that smatv systems are cable systems for purposes of qualifying for the compulsory copyright license established for cable systems by federal law 
the fcc has authorized a new interactive television service which will permit non video transmission of information between an individual s home and entertainment and information service providers 
this service will provide an alternative means for dbs systems and other video programming distributors  including television stations  to initiate the new interactive television services 
this service may also be used by the cable television industry 
the fcc also has initiated a new rulemaking proceeding looking toward the allocation of frequencies in the ghz range for a new multi channel wireless video service which could make video channels available in a single market 
it cannot be predicted at this time whether competitors will emerge utilizing such frequencies or whether such competition would have a material impact on the operations of cable television systems 
the fcc has recently auctioned a sizable amount of spectrum in the ghz band for use by a new wireless service  local multipoint distribution service lmds  which among other uses  can deliver over channels of digital programming directly to consumers homes 
the extent to which the winning licenses in this service will use this spectrum in particular regions of the country to deliver multichannel video programming to subscribers  and therefore provide competition for franchised cable systems  is at this time uncertain 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hyperion 
the act eliminates the restriction against ownership and operation of cable systems by local telephone companies within their local exchange service areas 
telephone companies are now free to enter the retail video distribution business through any means  such as dbs  mmds  smatv or as traditional franchised cable system operators 
alternatively  the act authorizes local telephone companies to operate open video systems without obtaining a local cable franchise  although telephone companies operating such systems can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
up to two thirds of the channel capacity of an open video system must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the local telephone company 
the open video system concept replaces the fcc s video dialtone rules 
the act also includes numerous provisions designed to make it easier for cable operators and others to compete directly with local exchange telephone carriers 
with certain limited exceptions  neither a local exchange carrier nor a cable operator can acquire more than of the other entity operating within its own service area 
advances in communications technology  as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment  are constantly occurring 
thus  it is not possible to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments might have on the cable industry 
the ability of cable systems to compete with present  emerging and future distribution media will depend to a great extent on obtaining attractive programming 
the availability and exclusive use of a sufficient amount of quality programming may in turn be affected by developments in regulation or copyright law 
see legislation and regulation 
the cable television industry competes with radio  television and print media for advertising revenues 
as the cable television industry continues to develop programming designed specifically for distribution by cable  advertising revenues may increase 
premium programming provided by cable systems is subject to the same competitive factors which exist for other programming discussed above 
the continued profitability of premium services may depend largely upon the continued availability of attractive programming at competitive prices 
hyperion competition in each of the markets served by hyperion s networks  the services offered by hyperion compete principally with the services offered by the incumbent local exchange carrier lec serving that area 
incumbent lecs have long standing relationships with their customers  have the potential to subsidize competitive services from monopoly service revenues  and benefit from favorable state and federal regulations 
in light of the passage of the telecommunications act of  federal and state regulatory initiatives will provide increased business opportunities to clecs such as hyperion  but regulators are likely to provide incumbent lecs with increased pricing flexibility for their services as competition increases 
there has also been significant merger activity among the rbocs in anticipation of entry into the long distance market  including the merger of bell atlantic and nynex  whose combined territory covers a substantial portion of hyperion s markets 
hyperion also faces  and will continue to face  competition from other current and potential market entrants  including other clecs  incumbent lecs which are not subject to rboc restrictions on long distance  at t  mci  sprint and other ixcs  cable television companies  electric utilities  microwave carriers  wireless telecommunications providers and private networks built by large end users 
in addition  all of the major ixcs are expected to enter the market for local telecommunications services 
hyperion also competes with equipment vendors and installers  and telecommunications management companies with respect to certain portions of its business 
employees at june   there were  full time employees of the company  olympus  and the managed partnerships  of which employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements at three locations 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be good 
legislation and regulation the company s existing and anticipated businesses are regulated by the fcc  some state governments and most local governments 
in addition  various legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration from time to time by congress and various federal agencies may materially affect the company s existing and anticipated businesses 
the following is a summary of federal laws and regulations affecting the growth and operation of the company s existing and anticipated businesses and a description of certain state and local laws 
cable television federal laws and regulations cable communications policy act of the cable act became effective on december  this federal statute  which amended the communications act of the communications act  created uniform national standards and guidelines for the regulation of cable television systems 
violations by a cable television system operator of provisions of the communications act  as well as of fcc regulations  can subject the operator to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions 
among other things  the cable act affirmed the right of franchising authorities state or local  depending on the practice in individual states to award one or more franchises within their jurisdictions 
it also prohibited non grandfathered cable television systems from operating without a franchise in such jurisdictions 
in connection with new franchises  the cable act provides that in granting or renewing franchises  franchising authorities may establish requirements for cable related facilities and equipment  but may not establish or enforce requirements for video programming or information services other than in broad categories 
cable television consumer protection and competition act of the cable act on october   congress enacted the cable act 
this legislation effected significant changes to the legislative and regulatory environment in which the cable industry operates 
it amended the cable act in many respects 
the cable act became effective on december   although certain provisions  most notably those dealing with rate regulation and retransmission consent  became effective at later dates 
the legislation also required the fcc to initiate a number of rulemaking proceedings to implement various provisions of the statute 
the cable act allows for a greater degree of regulation on the cable industry with respect to  among other things i cable system rates for both basic and certain nonbasic services  ii programming access and exclusivity arrangements  iii access to cable channels by unaffiliated programming services  iv leased access terms and conditions  v horizontal and vertical ownership of cable systems  vi customer service requirements  vii franchise renewals  viii television broadcast signal carriage and retransmission consent  ix technical standards  x subscriber privacy  xi consumer protection issues  xii cable equipment compatibility  xiii obscene or indecent programming and xiv requiring subscribers to subscribe to tiers of service other than basic service as a condition of purchasing premium services 
additionally  the legislation encourages competition with existing cable systems by allowing municipalities to own and operate their own cable systems without having to obtain a franchise  preventing franchising authorities from granting exclusive franchises or unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises covering an existing cable system s service area and prohibiting the common ownership of cable systems and co located mmds or smatv systems 
the cable act also precludes video programmers affiliated with cable television companies from favoring cable operators over competitors and requires such programmers to sell their programming to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision may limit the ability of cable programming suppliers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable television companies 
a number of provisions in the cable act relating to  among other things  rate regulation  have had a negative impact on the cable industry and the company s business 
telecommunications act of the act significantly revised the federal regulatory structure 
as it pertains to cable television  the act  among other things  i eliminates the regulation of certain nonbasic programming services in  ii expands the definition of effective competition  the existence of which displaces rate regulation  iii eliminates the restriction against the ownership and operation of cable systems by telephone companies within their local exchange service areas and iv liberalizes certain of the fcc s cross ownership restrictions 
the fcc has been conducting a number of rulemaking proceedings in order to implement many of the provisions of the act 
fcc regulation the fcc  the principal federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over cable television  has promulgated regulations covering such areas as the registration of cable systems  cross ownership between cable systems and other communications businesses  carriage of television broadcast programming  consumer education and lockbox enforcement  origination cablecasting and sponsorship identification  children s programming  the regulation of basic cable service rates in areas where cable systems are not subject to effective competition  signal leakage and frequency use  technical performance  maintenance of various records  equal employment opportunity  and antenna structure notification  marking and lighting 
the fcc has the authority to enforce these regulations through the imposition of substantial fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders and or the imposition of other administrative sanctions  such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities often used in connection with cable operations 
furthermore  the cable act required the fcc to adopt regulations covering  among other things  cable rates  signal carriage  consumer protection and customer service  leased access  indecent programming  programmer access to cable television systems  programming agreements  technical standards  consumer electronics equipment compatibility  ownership of home wiring  program exclusivity  equal employment opportunity  and various aspects of direct broadcast satellite system ownership and operation 
the act requires certain changes to various provisions of these regulations 
a brief summary of the most material federal regulations as adopted to date follows 
rate regulation the cable act codified existing fcc preemption of rate regulation for premium channels and optional nonbasic program tiers 
the cable act also deregulated basic cable rates for cable television systems determined by the fcc to be subject to effective competition 
the cable act substantially changed the statutory and fcc rate regulation standards 
the cable act replaced the fcc s old standard for determining effective competition  under which most cable systems were not subject to local rate regulation  with a statutory provision that has resulted in nearly all cable television systems becoming subject to local rate regulation of basic service 
additionally  the cable act eliminated the annual rate increase for basic service previously allowed by the cable act without local approval  required the fcc to adopt a formula  for franchising authorities to enforce  to assure that basic cable rates are reasonable  allows the fcc to review rates for nonbasic service tiers other than per channel or per program services in response to complaints filed by franchising authorities  prohibits cable television systems from requiring customers to purchase service tiers above basic service in order to purchase premium services if the system is technically capable of doing so  required the fcc to adopt regulations to establish  on the basis of actual costs  the price for installation of cable service  remote controls  converter boxes and additional outlets  and allows the fcc to impose restrictions on the retiering and rearrangement of cable services under certain limited circumstances 
the act expands the definition of effective competition to cover situations where a local telephone company or its affiliate  or any multichannel video provider using telephone company facilities  offers comparable video service by any means except dbs 
satisfaction of this test deregulates both basic and nonbasic tiers 
the act ends fcc regulation of nonbasic tier rates on march the fcc s regulations set standards for the regulation of basic and nonbasic cable service rates other than per channel or per program services 
the fcc s original rules became effective on september  the rules have been amended several times 
the rate regulations adopt a benchmark price cap system for measuring the reasonableness of existing basic and nonbasic service rates  and a formula for future rate increases based on inflation and increases in certain costs 
alternatively  cable operators have the opportunity to make cost of service showings which  in some cases  may justify rates above the applicable benchmarks 
the rules also require that charges for cable related equipment eg  converter boxes and remote control devices and installation services be unbundled from the provision of cable service and based upon actual costs plus a reasonable profit 
local franchising authorities and or the fcc are empowered to order a reduction of existing rates which exceed the benchmark level for either basic and or nonbasic cable services and associated equipment  and refunds could be required 
the retroactive refund period for basic cable service rates is limited to one year 
a significant number of franchising authorities have become certified by the fcc to regulate the rates charged by the company for basic cable service and for associated equipment 
the company s ability to implement rate increases consistent with its past practices will likely be limited by the regulations that the fcc has adopted 
carriage of broadcast television signals the cable act contains new mandatory carriage requirements 
these new rules allow commercial television broadcast stations which are local to a cable system ie  the system is located in the station s area of dominant influence  to elect every three years whether to require the cable system to carry the station  subject to certain exceptions  or whether the cable system will have to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station 
local  noncommercial television stations are also given mandatory carriage rights  subject to certain exceptions  within the larger of i a mile radius from the station s city of license or ii the station s grade b contour a measure of signal strength 
unlike commercial stations  noncommercial stations are not given the option to negotiate retransmission consent for the carriage of their signal 
in addition  cable systems will have to obtain retransmission consent for the carriage of all distant commercial broadcast stations  except for certain superstations  ie  commercial satellite delivered independent stations such as wtbs 
the cable act also eliminated  effective december   the fcc s regulations requiring the provision of input selector switches 
the statutory must carry provisions for noncommercial stations became effective on december  must carry rules for both commercial and noncommercial stations and retransmission consent rules for commercial stations were adopted by the fcc on march  the must carry requirement for commercial stations went into effect on june   and any stations for which retransmission consent had not been obtained other than must carry stations  non commercial stations and superstations had to be dropped as of october  the most recent election between must carry and retransmission consent for local commercial television broadcast stations was on october  a number of stations previously carried by the company s cable television systems elected retransmission consent 
the company was able to reach agreements with broadcasters who elected retransmission consent and has therefore not been required to pay cash compensation to broadcasters for retransmission consent or been required by broadcasters to remove broadcast stations from the cable television channel line ups 
the company has  however  agreed to carry some services eg  espn and a new service by fox in specified markets pursuant to retransmission consent arrangements which it believes are comparable to those entered into by most other large cable operators 
channel set asides the cable act permits local franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public  educational and governmental access programming 
the company believes that none of the systems franchises contain unusually onerous access requirements 
the cable act further requires cable systems with thirty six or more activated channels to designate a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties 
while the cable act presently allows cable operators substantial latitude in setting leased access rates  the cable act requires leased access rates to be set according to a formula determined by the fcc 
the fcc has recently revised the existing rate formula in a way which will significantly lower the rates cable operators have been able to charge 
it is possible that such leased access will result in competition to services offered by the company on the other channels of its cable systems 
competing franchises questions concerning the ability of municipalities to award a single cable television franchise and to impose certain franchise restrictions upon cable television companies have been considered in several recent federal appellate and district court decisions 
these decisions have been somewhat inconsistent and  until the us supreme court rules definitively on the scope of cable television s first amendment protections  the legality of the franchising process and of various specific franchise requirements is likely to be in a state of flux 
it is not possible at the present time to predict the constitutionally permissible bounds of cable franchising and particular franchise requirements 
however  the cable act  among other things  prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to grant franchises to competing cable systems and permits franchising authorities to operate their own cable systems without franchises 
cross ownership the act repealed the cable act s prohibition on lecs providing video programming directly to customers within their local exchange telephone service areas  except in rural areas or by specific waiver of fcc rules 
the act also authorized lecs to operate open video systems without obtaining a local cable franchise  although lecs operating such systems can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
where demand exceeds channel capacity  up to two thirds of the channels on an open video system must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the lec 
the act eliminated the fcc rule prohibiting common ownership between a cable system and a national broadcast television network 
the act also eliminated the statutory ban covering certain common ownership interests  operation or control between a television station and cable system within the station s grade b signal coverage area 
however  the parallel fcc rules against cable television station cross ownership remains in place  subject to review by the fcc within two years 
finally  the cable act prohibits common ownership  control or interest in cable television systems and mmds facilities or smatv systems having overlapping service areas  except in limited circumstances 
the act exempts cable systems facing effective competition from the mmds and smatv cross ownership restrictions 
pursuant to the cable act  the fcc has imposed limits on the number of cable systems which a single cable operator can own 
in general  no cable operator can have an attributable interest in cable systems which pass more than of all homes nationwide 
attributable interests for these purposes include voting interests of or more unless there is another single holder of more than of the voting stock  officerships  directorships and general partnership interests 
the fcc has stayed the effectiveness of these rules pending the outcome of the appeal from the us district court decision holding the multiple ownership limit provision of the cable act unconstitutional 
the fcc has also adopted rules which limit the number of channels on a cable system which can be occupied by programming in which the cable system s owner has an attributable interest 
the limit is of all activated channels 
franchise transfers the cable act requires franchising authorities to act on any franchise transfer request submitted after december  within days after receipt of all information required by fcc regulations and by the franchising authority 
approval is deemed to be granted if the franchising authority fails to act within such period 
technical requirements historically  the fcc has imposed technical standards applicable to the cable channels on which broadcast stations are carried  and has prohibited franchising authorities from adopting standards which were in conflict with or more restrictive than those established by the fcc 
the fcc has recently revised such standards and made them applicable to all classes of channels which carry downstream ntsc video programming 
local franchising authorities are permitted to enforce the fcc s new technical standards 
the fcc also has adopted additional standards applicable to cable television systems using frequencies in the mhz and mhz bands in order to prevent harmful interference with aeronautical navigation and safety radio services  and has also established limits on cable system signal leakage 
periodic testing by cable operators for compliance with these technical standards and signal leakage limits is required 
the company believes that the systems are in compliance with these standards in all material respects 
the cable act requires the fcc to update periodically its technical standards to take into account changes in technology 
the fcc has adopted regulations to implement the requirements of the cable act designed to improve the compatibility of cable systems and consumer electronics equipment 
pole attachments the fcc currently regulates the rates and conditions imposed by certain public utilities for use of their poles  unless under the federal pole attachments act  state public service commissions are able to demonstrate that they regulate rates  terms and conditions of the cable television pole attachments 
a number of states including massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio and vermont and the district of columbia have certified to the fcc that they regulate the rates  terms and conditions for pole attachments 
in the absence of state regulation  the fcc administers such pole attachment rates through use of a formula which it has devised and from time to time revises 
the act directs the fcc to adopt a new rate formula for any attaching party  including cable systems  which offers telecommunications services 
this new formula will result in significantly higher attachment rates for cable systems which choose to offer such services 
other matters fcc regulation also includes matters regarding a cable system s carriage of local sports programming  restrictions on origination and cablecasting by cable system operators  application of the rules governing political broadcasts  customer service  home wiring  and limitations on advertising contained in nonbroadcast children s programming 
copyright cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of broadcast signals 
in exchange for making semi annual payments to a federal copyright royalty pool and meeting certain other obligations  cable operators obtain a statutory license to retransmit broadcast signals 
the amount of this royalty payment varies  depending on the amount of system revenues from certain sources  the number of distant signals carried  and the location of the cable system with respect to over the air television stations 
various bills have been introduced into congress over the past several years that would eliminate or modify the cable television compulsory license 
at the request of congress  the copyright office has commenced an inquiry into possible revisions of the compulsory license 
without the compulsory license  cable operators might need to negotiate rights from the copyright owners for each program carried on each broadcast station in the channel lineup 
such negotiated agreements could increase the cost to cable operators of carrying broadcast signals 
the cable act s retransmission consent provisions expressly provide that retransmission consent agreements between television broadcast stations and cable operators do not obviate the need for cable operators to obtain a copyright license for the programming carried on each broadcaster s signal 
copyrighted music performed in programming supplied to cable television systems by pay cable networks such as hbo and basic cable networks such as usa network has generally been licensed by the networks through private agreements with the american society of composers and publishers ascap and bmi  inc bmi  the two major performing rights organizations in the united states 
as a result of extensive litigation  ascap and bmi are both now required to offer through to the viewer licenses to the cable networks which would cover the retransmission of the cable networks programming by cable systems to their subscribers 
copyrighted music performed by cable systems themselves on local origination channels  peg channels  and in locally inserted advertising and cross promotional announcements must also be licensed 
a blanket license is available from bmi 
cable industry negotiations with ascap are still in progress 
cable television state and local regulation because a cable television system uses local streets and rights of way  cable television systems are subject to state and local regulation  typically imposed through the franchising process 
state and or local officials are usually involved in franchise selection  system design and construction  safety  service rates  consumer relations  billing practices and community related programming and services 
cable television systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises  permits or licenses granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity 
franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases are terminable if the franchise operator fails to comply with material provisions 
the cable act established renewal procedures and criteria designed to protect incumbent franchises against arbitrary denials of renewal 
while these formal procedures are not mandatory unless timely invoked by either the cable operator or the franchising authority  they can provide substantial protection to incumbent franchisees 
even after the formal renewal procedures are invoked  franchising authorities and cable operators remain free to negotiate a renewal outside the formal process 
nevertheless  renewal is by no means assured  as the franchisee must meet certain statutory standards 
even if a franchise is renewed  a franchising authority may impose new and more onerous requirements such as upgrading facilities and equipment  although the municipality must take into account the cost of meeting such requirements 
the cable act makes several changes to the process under which a cable operator seeks to enforce its renewal rights which could make it easier in some cases for a franchising authority to deny renewal 
franchises usually call for the payment of fees  often based on a percentage of the system s gross subscriber revenues  to the granting authority 
although franchising authorities may impose franchise fees under the cable act  such payments cannot exceed of a cable system s annual gross revenues 
in those communities in which franchise fees are required  the company currently pays franchise fees ranging up to of gross revenues 
franchising authorities are also empowered in awarding new franchises or renewing existing franchises to require cable operators to provide cable related facilities and equipment and to enforce compliance with voluntary commitments 
in the case of franchises in effect prior to the effective date of the cable act  franchising authorities may enforce requirements contained in the franchise relating to facilities  equipment and services  whether or not cable related 
the cable act  under certain limited circumstances  permits a cable operator to obtain modifications of franchise obligations 
upon receipt of a franchise  the cable system owner usually is subject to a broad range of obligations to the issuing authority directly affecting the business of the system 
the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and even from city to city within the same state  historically ranging from reasonable to highly restrictive or burdensome 
the cable act places certain limitations on a franchising authority s ability to control the operation of a cable system operator and the courts have from time to time reviewed the constitutionality of several general franchise requirements  including franchise fees and access channel requirements  often with inconsistent results 
on the other hand  the cable act prohibits exclusive franchises  and allows franchising authorities to exercise greater control over the operation of franchised cable systems  especially in the area of customer service and rate regulation 
the cable act also allows franchising authorities to operate their own multichannel video distribution system without having to obtain a franchise and permits states or local franchising authorities to adopt certain restrictions on the ownership of cable systems 
moreover  franchising authorities are immunized from monetary damage awards arising from regulation of cable systems or decisions made on franchise grants  renewals  transfers and amendments 
the specific terms and conditions of a franchise and the laws and regulations under which it was granted directly affect the profitability of the cable television system 
cable franchises generally contain provisions governing charges for basic cable television services  fees to be paid to the franchising authority  length of the franchise term  renewal  sale or transfer of the franchise  territory of the franchise  design and technical performance of the system  use and occupancy of public streets and number and types of cable services provided 
the act prohibits a franchising authority from either requiring or limiting a cable operator s provision of telecommunications services 
various proposals have been introduced at the state and local levels with regard to the regulation of cable television systems  and a number of states have adopted legislation subjecting cable television systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state governmental agencies  even to the exclusion of local community regulation 
some of these states regulate jointly and impose regulation of a character similar to that of a public utility 
attempts in other states to regulate cable television systems are continuing and can be expected to increase 
such proposals and legislation may be preempted by federal statute and or fcc regulation 
to date  the states in which the company operates that have enacted such state level regulation are new york  new jersey  massachusetts and vermont 
the company cannot predict whether other states in which it currently operates  or in which it may acquire systems  will engage in such regulation in the future 
the foregoing does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal  state and local regulations and legislation relating to the cable television industry 
other existing federal regulations  copyright licensing and  in many jurisdictions  state and local franchise requirements currently are the subject of a variety of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative and legislative proposals which could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which cable television systems operate 
neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry or the company can be predicted at this time 
telephony and telecommunications federal laws and regulations the act also alters federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding telecommunications providers and services  including the company  and creates a favorable environment in which the company may provide telephone and other telecommunications services and facilities 
the following is a summary of the key provisions of the act that could materially affect the telecommunications business of the company 
the act was intended to promote the provision of competitive telephone services and facilities by cable television companies and others 
the act declares that no state or local laws or regulations may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service 
states are authorized to impose competitively neutral requirements regarding universal service  public safety and welfare  service quality  and consumer protection 
the act further provides that cable operators and affiliates providing telecommunications services are not required to obtain a separate franchise from local franchising authorities lfas for such services 
an lfa may not order a cable operator or affiliate to discontinue providing telecommunications services or discontinue operating its cable system on the basis that it has failed to obtain a separate franchise or renewal for the provision of telecommunications services 
the act prohibits lfas from requiring cable operators to provide telecommunications service or facilities as a condition of the grant of a franchise  franchise renewal  or franchise transfer  except that lfas may seek institutional networks as part of such franchise negotiations 
the act provides that  when cable operators provide telecommunications services  lfas may require reasonable  competitively neutral compensation for management of the public rights of way 
the lfa must publicly disclose such compensation requirements 
the company believes that it qualifies as a connecting carrier under federal law and therefore does not need fcc certification to provide intrastate service 
in the event that it is determined that the company must seek fcc certification  the company believes that such certification will be granted by the fcc in a timely manner 
the company may be required to file certain tariffs and reports with the fcc 
interconnection and other telecommunications carrier obligations to facilitate the entry of new telecommunications providers including cable operators  the act imposes interconnection obligations on all telecommunications carriers 
all carriers must interconnect their networks with other carriers and must not deploy network features and functions that interfere with interoperability 
lecs also have a set of separate identified obligations beyond those that apply to new entrants i good faith negotiation with those seeking interconnection  ii unbundling  equal access and non discrimination requirements  iii resale of services  including resale at wholesale rates  iv notice of changes in the network that would affect interconnection and interoperability and v physical collocation unless shown that practical technical reasons  or space limitations  make physical collocation impractical 
under the act  individual interconnection rates must be just and reasonable  based on cost  and may include a reasonable profit 
traffic termination charges shall be mutual and reciprocal 
the act permits carriers to agree on a bill and keep system  but does not require such a system 
the act contemplates that interconnection agreements will be negotiated by the parties and submitted to a state public service commission spsc for approval 
a spsc may become involved  at the request of either party  if negotiations fail 
if the state regulator refuses to act  the fcc may determine the matter 
if the spsc acts  an aggrieved party s remedy is to file a case in federal district court 
the act provides for a rural exemption to interconnection requests  but also provides that the exception does not apply where a cable operator makes an interconnection request of a rural lec within the operator s franchise area 
the act requires that all telecommunications providers including cable operators that provide telecommunications services must contribute equitably to a universal service fund usf  and the fcc may exempt an interstate carrier or class of carriers if their contribution would be minimal under the usf formula 
the act allows states to determine which intrastate telecommunications providers contribute to the usf 
the act prohibits geographic end user rate de averaging to protect rural subscribers rates 
fcc interconnection order on august  the fcc released its first report and order  second report and order and memorandum opinion and order promulgating rules and regulations to implement congress statutory directive converning the interconnection obligations of all telecommuications carriers  including obligations of clecs and lecs  and incumbent lec pricing of interconnection and unbundled elements the local competition orders 
the local competition orders adopted a national framework for interconnection but left to the individual states the task of implementing the fcc s rules 
the local competition orders also established rules implementing the act requirements that lecs negotiate interconnection agreements  and provide guidelines for review of such agreements by state pucs 
on july   the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit eighth circuit vacated certain portions of the local competition orders  including provisions establishing a methodology for pricing interconnection and unbundled netowrk elements  a rule permitting new entrants to pick and choose among various provisions of existing interconnecton agreements between lecs and their competitors  and other provisions relating to the purchase of access to unbundled netowrk elements 
the operating companies had negotiated and obtained state pucs approval of a anumber of interconnection agreements with incumbent lecs prior to this eighth circuit decision 
the eighth circuit decision has created uncertainty about individual state rules governing pricing  terms and conditions of interconnection decisions  and could make negotiating and enforcing such agreements in the future more difficult and protracted 
it could also require renegotiation of relevant portions of existing incerconnection agreements  or subject them to additional court and regulatory proceedings 
it remains to be seen whether the network can continue to obtain andmaintain interconnection agreements on terms acceptable to them in every state  though most states have already adopted pricing rules  if not interim prices  which are for the most part consistent with the fcc s related pricing provisions 
the supreme court has agreed to review the various eighth circuit decisions vacating major portions of the fcc s local competition orders 
in so doing  the court also granted several cross petitions for review by incumbent lecs challenging portions of the eighth circuit opinion that upheld certain fcc determinations with respect to unbundled network elements 
a decision by the supreme court is not expected until early internet services federal laws and regulations transmitting indecent material via the internet was made criminal by the act 
however  on line access providers are exempted from criminal liability for simply providing interconnection service  they are also granted an affirmative defense from criminal or other action where in good faith they restrict access to indecent materials 
these provisions have been challenged in federal court 
the act further exempts on line access providers from civil liability for actions taken in good faith to restrict access to obscene  excessively violent or otherwise objectionable material 
telephony and telecommunications state law and regulation adelphia s nonconsolidated joint venture  olympus communications  lp  has systems in florida 
in  the florida legislature amended chapter of florida statutes by enacting an act relating to local exchange telecommunications companies florida act chapter  fl 
stat 

this new law substantially altered florida law regarding telecommunications providers and services  such as olympus 
the following is a summary of the key provisions of the florida act and associated florida public service commission psc actions that could materially affect olympus telecommunications business 
the florida act the florida act vests in the psc virtually exclusive jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications matters 
the florida act limits municipalities to taxation of certain telecommunications services or management of long distance carriers occupation of local rights of way 
the florida act further directs the psc to employ flexible regulatory treatment to ensure the widest possible range of telecommunications services  and provides that new entrants such as the company are subject to a lesser level of regulatory oversight than lecs 
psc actions pursuant to the florida act and the act and the fcc s first report and order  the psc is conducting several proceedings to address competitive issues 
to summarize  pursuant to the florida act  the psc has adopted rules requiring certification of clec interexchange telecommunications service providers  operator service providers  alternative access vendor services  and shared tenant services providers 
the florida act provides that the psc shall grant certification to applicants upon a showing of sufficient technical  financial  and managerial capability to provide service in the geographic area proposed to be served 
the company believes that olympus meets the statutory requirements for psc certification for any type of intrastate telecommunications service provider  and that any such application process should be completed expeditiously 
in addition  like the act  the florida act requires lecs to interconnect with certified clecs 
approximately fourteen interconnection agreements have been reached between lecs and clecs to date  while approximately five clecs have requested psc arbitration of stalled agreements 
the psc is obligated under the florida act to arbitrate any disputes in no more than days from date of request 
as well  the psc has ordered bellsouth  the state s largest lec  to unbundle eight network elements for resale by clecs  and the psc has ordered favorable interim rates for these elements 
the psc has not yet adopted an order resolving wholesale discounts associated with local service resale 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that the florida act and actions of the psc to date reflect a generally favorable legal and regulatory environment for new entrants  such as olympus  to intrastate telecommunications in florida

the changes in adelphia s results of operations for the years ended march  and  compared to the respective prior year  were primarily the result of acquisitions  expanding existing cable television operations and the impact of increased advertising sales and other service offerings as well as an increase in cable rates  effective october  and august  the high level of depreciation and amortization associated with the significant number of acquisitions in recent years  the recent upgrading and expansion of systems  interest costs associated with financing activities and hyperion s continued investment in the clec business will continue to have a negative impact on the reported results of operations 
also  significant charges for depreciation  amortization and interest are expected to be incurred in the future by the olympus joint venture  which will also adversely impact adelphia s future results of operations 
adelphia expects to report net losses for the next several years

the increases were attributable to the following year ended march  acquisitions basic subscriber growth rate increases premium programming fees advertising sales and other services effective october  and august   certain rate increases related to regulated cable services were implemented in substantially all of the company s systems 
advertising revenues and revenues derived from other strategic service offerings such as paging  high speed data services  long distance and clec services also had a positive impact on revenues for the year ended march  direct operating and programming expenses 
direct operating and programming expenses  which are mainly basic and premium programming costs and technical expenses  increased and for the years ended march  and  respectively  compared with the respective prior year 
such increases were primarily due to increased operating expenses from acquired systems  increased programming costs and incremental costs associated with increased subscribers 
because of regulatory limitations on the timing and extent to which cost increases may be passed on to customers  direct operating and programming expenses have increased at a greater rate than corresponding revenue increases 
as a result of recent fcc regulatory rulemaking decisions  the company intends to continue its systematic program of rate increases to reverse this trend 
additionally  hyperion expenses increased due to expansion of operations at its network control center  as well as an increase in the number and size of its networks  which resulted in increased employee related costs and equipment maintenance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  which are mainly comprised of costs related to system offices  customer service representatives  and sales and administrative employees  increased and for the years ended march  and  respectively  compared with the respective prior year 
the increases were primarily due to incremental costs associated with acquisitions  subscriber growth and hyperion overhead and network operating and control center cost increases to accommodate the growth in the number of operating companies managed and monitored 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was higher for the years ended march  and  compared with the respective prior year  primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions consummated during the years ended march   and  as well as increased capital expenditures made during the past several years

on may   the company reached a settlement with the fcc regarding such rate disputes 
the amount recorded in the year ended march  was adequate to cover the settlement 
priority investment income from olympus 
priority investment income is comprised of payments received from olympus of accrued priority return on the company s investment in plp interests in olympus 
priority investment income increased during the years ended march  and as compared with the respective prior year due to increased payments by olympus 
interest expense net 
interest expense net increased approximately and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
for the year ended march  interest expense increased primarily due to incremental debt related to acquisitions and the issuance of the hyperion senior discount notes 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate on outstanding debt 
for the year ended march   interest expense net increased primarily due to incremental debt related to acquisitions and the issuance of the hyperion senior secured notes 
these increases were partially offset by i the utilization of the proceeds from the convertible preferred stock and the redeemable preferred stock offerings to repay outstanding debt  ii the refinancing of outstanding borrowings  and iii interest income on cash balances 
interest expense includes non cash accretion of original issue discount and non cash interest expense totaling   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in non cash interest for the year ended march  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to adelphia s cash payment of interest on its senior pay in kind notes for the six month period ended february  this decrease was partially offset by the accretion of original issue discount related to the hyperion senior discount notes 
equity in loss of joint ventures 
the equity in loss of joint ventures represents primarily i the company s pro rata share of olympus losses and the accretion requirements of olympus preferred limited partner interests  and ii hyperion s pro rata share of its less than majority owned partnerships operating losses 
the increase in the loss during the year ended march   compared with the prior year  is due to an increase in the losses of certain investments in the clec business in which hyperion is a less than majority partner and increased losses of olympus 
the increase in the loss during the year ended march   compared with the prior year  is primarily due to losses of olympus and an increase in the losses of certain hyperion clec joint ventures

as a result of these two transactions  adelphia recognized an extraordinary loss of  for the year ended march liquidity and capital resources the cable television and other telecommunications businesses are capital intensive and typically require continual financing for the construction  modernization  maintenance  expansion and acquisition of cable and other telecommunications systems

adelphia exchanged its systems serving  subscribers primarily in the mansfield  ohio area for systems owned by time warner cable companies serving  subscribers adjacent to systems owned or managed by adelphia in virginia  new england and new york 
hyperion on september  and february   hyperion acquired the partnership interests of various of its local partners  thereby increasing its ownership interest in seven of its networks to for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately  and certain other consideration 
as a result of these transactions  hyperion s weighted average ownership in its networks  based upon gross property plant and equipment  increased to as of march  these transactions are consistent with hyperion s goal to own at least a interest in each of its networks and to dispose of its interests in those in which acquiring a controlling interest is not economically attractive 
hyperion may consider similar transactions from time to time in its other markets 
on march   the fcc completed the auction of licenses for local multipoint distribution service lmds 
hyperion  through a limited partnership in which it is a limited partner  was the successful bidder at a net cost of  for ghz licenses  which cover approximately of the nation s population in excess of million people in the eastern half of the united states

there can be no assurances that lmds spectrum will provide a cost effective means to connect to end user locations 
resources 
the company plans to continue to explore and consider new commitments  arrangements or transactions to refinance existing debt  increase the company s liquidity or decrease the company s leverage 
these could include  among other things  the future issuance by adelphia  or its subsidiaries  of public or private equity or debt and the negotiation of new or amended credit facilities 
these could also include entering into acquisitions  joint ventures or other investment or financing activities  although no assurance can be given that any such transactions will be consummated 
the company s ability to borrow under current credit facilities and to enter into refinancings and new financings is limited by covenants contained in adelphia s indentures and its subsidiaries credit agreements  including covenants under which the ability to incur indebtedness is in part a function of applicable ratios of total debt to cash flow 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds  borrowings under existing credit facilities  and future financing sources will be sufficient to meet its short term and long term liquidity and capital requirements 
although in the past the company has been able to refinance its indebtedness or obtain new financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that the terms of such financings would be favorable 
management believes that the telecommunications industry  including the cable television and telephone industries  continues to be in a period of consolidation characterized by mergers  joint ventures  acquisitions  sales of all or part of cable companies or their assets  and other partnering and investment transactions of various structures and sizes involving cable or other telecommunications companies 
the company continues to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of its business through the acquisition of additional cable television systems in geographic proximity to its existing regional markets or in locations that can serve as a basis for new market areas 
the company  like other telecommunications companies  has participated from time to time and is participating in preliminary discussions with third parties regarding a variety of potential transactions  and the company has considered and expects to continue to consider and explore potential transactions of various types with other cable and telecommunications companies 
however  no assurances can be given as to whether any such transaction may be consummated or  if so  when

regulatory and competitive matters the cable television operations of the company may be adversely affected by changes and developments in governmental regulation  competitive forces and technology 
the cable television industry and the company are subject to extensive regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
the cable act significantly expanded the scope of regulation of certain subscriber rates and a number of other matters in the cable industry  such as mandatory carriage of local broadcast stations and retransmission consent  and increased the administrative costs of complying with such regulations 
the fcc has adopted rate regulations that establish  on a system by system basis  maximum allowable rates for i basic and cable programming services other than programming offered on a per channel or per program basis  based upon a benchmark methodology  and ii associated equipment and installation services based upon cost plus a reasonable profit 
under the fcc rules  franchising authorities are authorized to regulate rates for basic services and associated equipment and installation services  and the fcc will regulate rates for regulated cable programming services in response to complaints filed with the agency 
the act ends fcc regulation of cable programming service tier rates on march  rates for basic and cable programming services are set pursuant to a benchmark formula 
alternatively  a cable operator may elect to use a cost of service methodology to show that rates for basic and cable programming services are reasonable 
refunds with interest will be required to be paid by cable operators who are required to reduce regulated rates 
the fcc has reserved the right to reduce or increase the benchmarks it has established 
the rate regulations also limit increases in regulated rates to an inflation indexed amount plus increases in certain costs such as taxes  franchise fees  costs associated with specific franchise requirements and increased programming costs 
cost based adjustments to these capped rates can also be made in the event a cable operator adds or deletes channels or completes a significant system rebuild or upgrade 
because of the limitation on rate increases for regulated services  future revenue growth from cable services will rely to a much greater extent than has been true in the past on increased revenues from unregulated services and new subscribers than from increases in previously unregulated rates 
the fcc has adopted regulations implementing all of the requirements of the cable act 
the fcc is also likely to continue to modify  clarify or refine the rate regulations 
adelphia cannot predict the effect of the act or future rulemaking proceedings or changes to the rate regulations 
in fiscal  adelphia recorded a  charge representing management s estimate of the total costs to be incurred to resolve all of adelphia s rate complaints with the fcc 
on may   adelphia reached a settlement of all rate complaints before the fcc on terms and conditions consistent with certain other cable television companies that utilized a la carte packages that have reached settlement resolution with the fcc on this issue 
under the terms of the agreement  adelphia made refunds of approximately  including interest through december   plus interest from january  through the date of payment 
adelphia also reduced its rates in certain communities 
at march   of the  charge remained in accrued interest and other liabilities  which management believes is adequate to cover the settlement 
no assurance can be given as to what other future actions congress  the fcc or other regulatory authorities may take or the effects thereof on adelphia 
adelphia is currently unable to predict the effect that the amended regulations  future fcc treatment of a la carte packages or other future fcc rulemaking proceedings will have on their business and results of operations in future periods 
cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time 
because such franchises are generally non exclusive  there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems  including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves  and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes 
the cable act and the act contain provisions which encourage competition from such other sources 
the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators  local telephone companies  other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home  or other potential competitors  or  if such competition materializes  the extent of its effect on the company 
the act repealed the prohibition on clecs from providing video programming directly to customers within their local exchange areas other than in rural areas or by specific waiver of fcc rules 
the act also authorized clecs to operate open video systems ovs without obtaining a local cable franchise  although clecs operating such a system can be required to make payments to local governmental bodies in lieu of cable franchise fees 
where demand exceeds capacity  up to two thirds of the channels on an ovs must be available to programmers unaffiliated with the clec 
the statute states that the ovs scheme supplants the fcc s video dialtone rules 
the fcc has promulgated rules to implement the ovs concept  and new jersey bell telephone company has been granted permission to convert its video dialtone authorization in dover township  new jersey to an ovs authorization 
the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  the impact of any such effect is not known or estimable 
the company also competes with dbs service providers 
dbs has been available to consumers since a single dbs satellite can provide more than channels of programming 
dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small outdoor antenna 
dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nationwide basis by several service providers 
at this time  any impact of dbs competition on the company s future results is not known or estimable 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has recently completed the planning stage of a project that addresses the year data processing issues relating to modifications of its mainframe computer applications 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and perform the necessary tests  all of which is expected to be completed by june the financial impact of these modifications is not expected to be significant to the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company has begun communicating with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company
