in addition  the company incurred a non cash expense of  in settlement of a contractual right 
as a result  net loss decreased  for the year ended december  from the prior year 
during  the company conducted clinical trials for its oral and injectable forms of calcitonin and continued its scale up and production of cgmp calcitonin as well as its ongoing collaborative research projects  which together increased research and development expenses 
in addition  there were increased financings causing an increase in interest expense

the adoption of sfas has had no effect on the company s reported per share results 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company completed construction of its peptide production facility in boonton  new jersey 
the facility was constructed in a shell building that is being leased under a year net lease which began in february the company has two year renewal options as well as an option to purchase the facility 
the total cost of leasehold improvements and process equipment for this facility  including current validation costs  totaled approximately million 
the improvements and equipment were primarily financed from the remainder of the million of proceeds received as a result of the exercise by the warrant holders of the company s class a warrants in and the proceeds of million from the sale of stock in there are currently no material commitments outstanding for capital expenditures relating to either the boonton facility or the company s facility in fairfield 
the company  at december   had cash and cash equivalents of  a decrease of  from december  the company s ability to generate cash from operations will depend primarily upon signing research or licensing agreements  achieving defined benchmarks in such agreements  receiving regulatory approval for its licensed products  and the commercial sale of these products 
in  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with a pharmaceutical company in china 
this joint venture contributed  to revenues 
it is uncertain whether any additional revenues will be recognized or received in connection with this joint venture 
in july  the company entered into an agreement under which it granted to the parke davis division of warner lambert company a worldwide license to use the company s oral calcitonin technology 
upon execution of the agreement  the company received million in payments from warner lambert  consisting of a million licensing fee and a million equity investment by warner lambert  shares of common stock were purchased at a price of approximately per share 
in addition  the company is eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments during the course of the development program if specified milestones are achieved  of which million would be received prior to the commencement of phase i clinical studies in the us the first of these milestones was achieved in february  resulting in a payment to the company of million 
if the product is successfully commercialized  the company also would receive revenue from royalties on product sales by warner lambert and its affiliates and from the sale of raw material to warner lambert 
the company has retained the right to license the use of its technologies for injectable and nasal formulations of calcitonin on a worldwide basis 
the company s cash requirements have increased to approximately million per year with the opening of its peptide manufacturing facility 
in addition  the company faces principal and interest obligations over the next several years under its outstanding convertible debentures and other indebtedness 
however  because of the current below market conversion prices of each of the issues of debentures  a substantial portion of such debentures has been  and a substantial portion of the remainder is expected to be  converted into common stock  thereby decreasing the amount of cash required for principal and interest payments 
see note of notes to financial statements 
after receipt of an aggregate of million from warner lambert in july and february  management believes that the company currently has sufficient financial resources to sustain its operations at the current level through the second quarter of the company will require additional funds to ensure continued operations beyond that time 
management currently believes that the various milestones in the warner lambert agreement can be achieved on a timely basis thereby precluding the need for any outside financing of the company s operations in the near term 
early stage milestones primarily relate to the product s performance characteristics  while the latter stage milestones are primarily related to regulatory filings and approvals 
in addition to the warner lambert agreement  management is actively seeking other licensing and or supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies for injectable and nasal forms of calcitonin 
however  there is no assurance that any additional revenue generating agreements will be signed 
in the absence of or the delay in achieving the warner lambert milestones or in signing other agreements  obtaining adequate funds from other sources  which might include a debt or equity financing  would be necessary to sustain the company s operations 
however  there is no assurance as to the terms on which such additional funds would be available or that in such circumstances sufficient funds could be obtained 
while the company believes that the implementation of the warner lambert licensing transaction will satisfy the company s liquidity requirements over the near term  satisfying the company s long term liquidity requirements will require the successful commercialization of the product licensed to warner lambert or one of its other calcitonin products 
in addition  the commercialization of a calcitonin product will require the company to incur additional capital expenditures  including expenditures to expand or upgrade the company s manufacturing operations to satisfy its supply obligations under the warner lambert license agreement 
however  neither the cost or timing of such capital expenditures are determinable at this time
