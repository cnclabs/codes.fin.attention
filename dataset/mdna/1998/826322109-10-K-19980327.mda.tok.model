specialty product revenue and expense is primarily related to the workers compensation insurance business 
the combined ratio for the workers compensation insurance business was compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the reduction was due to a basis point decrease in the loss ratio along with a basis point decrease in the expense ratio 
compared to the prior year period  incurred losses for the current accident year were reduced as a result of the company s ability to overlay and implement managed care techniques to the workers compensation claims 
in addition  the company had net favorable loss development totaling million compared to net favorable loss development of million for the comparable prior year period 
the favorable development is largely due to actual paid losses below projected losses and the majority of the favorable loss development occurred on the through accident years 
there can be no assurances that favorable development  or the magnitude thereof  will continue in the future 
the losses and loss adjustment expense ratio for the year ended december  reflects the company s current projection of the ultimate costs of claims occurring in the current as well as prior accident years

excluding these non recurring costs  the effective tax rate for is

medical and specialty product expenses

in addition  specialty product expenses for and were impacted by the loss development on prior accident years 
during the year  the company had net favorable loss development on prior accident years of million  compared to net favorable loss development of million for the comparable prior year period 
the majority of the favorable loss development occurred on the through accident years 
the favorable development on the year appears to be primarily due to the company s aggressive actions to resolve claims

the company will fund approximately million to smhs during the seven month implementation period of the tricare region contract 
these monies will be reimbursed by the department of defense in accordance with the provisions of the contract 
smhs was notified on february  that the gao sustained a competitor s protest of the contract award for tricare managed care support region and recommended that the contract be re bid 
the tma  along with the company  has filed a motion requesting that the gao reconsider its recommendation 
if the gao does not change its recommendation and the tma follows the recommendation  there are several possible outcomes  including litigation 
the company currently anticipates providing health care delivery for one year of the contract should a re bid occur 
the company is in the process of modifying or replacing its computer systems and applications to accommodate the year 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems will recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company currently expects to complete all material replacements or modifications of its computer systems and applications sufficiently in advance of the year to allow for adequate testing so as not to negatively impact its operations 
the company is in the process of implementing two major systems at an estimated cost of million 
these systems will be year compliant 
the company is expensing the costs to make modifications as incurred 
management currently estimates the remaining modification costs to be approximately million to million over the next to months 
while this is a substantial effort  it will give the company the benefits of new technology and functionality for many of its financial and operational computer systems and applications 
the inability of the company to timely complete its year modifications and replacements  or the inability of companies with which the company does business to timely complete their year modifications  could have a material effect on the company s operations 
the company has a capital budget of approximately million  primarily for computer hardware and software  medical buildings  furniture and equipment for the newly constructed  square foot  six story corporate headquarters building  and other requirements due to the company s projected growth and expansion 
the company financed a portion of the newly constructed administrative building in january  and received million 
on january   million of the projected capital expenditure budget was used by the company to purchase all of the assets and operations of three clinics in southern nevada 
the company s liquidity needs over the next months will primarily be for the capital items noted above to support growing membership in nevada  implementation of the region tricare contract  the company s stock repurchase program  as well as debt service and expansion of the company s operations  including potential acquisitions 
the company believes that existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  mortgage financing and equipment leasing  and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures  debt service and any expansion activities during the next months 
additionally  subject to unanticipated cash requirements  the company believes that its existing working capital and operating cash flow and  if necessary  its access to new credit facilities  will enable it to meet its liquidity needs on a longer term basis 
the holding company may receive dividends from its hmo and insurance subsidiaries which generally must be approved by certain state insurance departments 
the company s hmo and insurance subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain certain deposits and must also meet certain net worth and reserve requirements 
the hmo and insurance subsidiaries had restricted assets on deposit in various states totaling million and million  as of december  and december   respectively 
the hmo and insurance subsidiaries also meet requirements to maintain minimum stockholder s equity ranging from million to million 
of the cash and cash equivalents held at december   million is designated for use only by the regulated subsidiaries 
such amounts are available for transfer to the holding company from the hmo and insurance subsidiaries only to the extent that they can be remitted in accordance with terms of existing management agreements and by dividends 
remaining amounts are available on an unrestricted basis 
the holding company will not receive dividends from its hmo or insurance subsidiaries that would cause violation of statutory net worth and reserve requirements 
inflation health care costs generally continue to rise at a faster rate than the consumer price index 
the company uses various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on its anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with the company s various health care providers  and other health care cost containment measures 
there can be no assurance  however  that  in the future  the company s ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation the company s business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion in promulgating regulations and in interpreting and enforcing laws and regulations 
while the company is unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or the impact on the company of any particular change  the company s operations and financial results could be negatively affected by regulatory revisions 
for example  any proposals affecting underwriting practices  limiting rate increases  requiring new or additional benefits or affecting contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care providers willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for the company to control medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in applicable laws and regulations  the company is subject to various audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the federal employee retirement income security act  which regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers  the federal employees health benefit plan  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery of health care 
any such government action could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect the company s reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for the company to sell its products and services
