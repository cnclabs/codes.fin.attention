other matters the company is modifying its computer software to accommodate the year internal related computer costs are anticipated to be minor 
the company does not anticipate incurring any external costs to be year compliant 
where appropriate  graham is obtaining confirmation from its significant suppliers and customers that they  too  are actively making the required changes 
graham is not aware of any problems at this time 
although graham believes it will be year compliant  the company cannot assure anyone that its customers  suppliers  or governmental agencies will be ready 
increases in material and labor costs experienced in recent years have been offset by cost cutting measures and selling price increases 
obtaining price increases are largely a factor of supply and demand for graham s products  whereas inflation factors can originate from influences outside of the company s direct global competition
