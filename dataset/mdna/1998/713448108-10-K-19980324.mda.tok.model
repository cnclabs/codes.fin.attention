item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  cash flows and liquidity and capital resources management s discussion and analysis all per share information is computed using average shares outstanding  assuming dilution 
introduction management s discussion and analysis is presented in four sections 
the introductory section discusses the disposal of the restaurants segment and two pervasive issues impacting many companies  market risk and year pages 
the second section analyzes the results of operations  first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our two industry segments pages 
the final two sections address our consolidated cash flows and liquidity and capital resources pages 
cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding pepsico s future performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are also inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from what we expect 
disposal of the restaurants segment on august  we announced that our board of directors approved a formal plan to spin off our restaurant businesses to our shareholders 
under the plan  owners of pepsico capital stock as of september  received one share of common stock of the new restaurant company  tricon global restaurants  inc tricon  for every ten shares of pepsico capital stock 
the spin off was completed on october  distribution date 
in  we also sold pepsico food systems pfs  the restaurant distribution operation and all of the non core us restaurant businesses 
as a result  the sales  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities  and cash flows of the restaurants segment have been classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
see note accordingly  the discussions that follow focus on the continuing operations of our packaged goods businesses 
market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios  foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses and commodity prices  affecting the cost of our products 
interest rates pepsico centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
we use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt they are intended to modify 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt 
accordingly  any market risk or opportunity associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is our practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by million 
foreign exchange operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  can cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constitute about percent of our consolidated operating profit  excluding unusual items 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating profit include the mexican peso  british pound  canadian dollar and brazilian real 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than million 
this represents of the international segment operating profit disclosed on page f after adjusting for unusual items 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses arising from the remeasurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings for the last three years 
the sensitivity analyses presented in the interest and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa 
commodities we are subject to market risk with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use futures contracts to hedge immaterial amounts of our commodity purchases 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in a company s operations 
if either we  our significant customers or suppliers fail to correct year issues  such failure could have a significant impact on our ability to operate our businesses 
however  the impact cannot be quantified at this time 
we are in the process of taking actions to address and complete the work associated with the year each of our business segments and corporate have established teams to identify and correct year issues 
internal software with non compliant code is expected to be fixed or replaced with software that is year compliant 
similar attention is being given to technology infrastructures  manufacturing plants and building facilities to achieve compliance in all these areas 
the teams are also charged with investigating the year capabilities of suppliers  customers and other external entities  and with developing contingency plans where necessary 
an inventory and assessment of all computer systems and application software have been completed  and plans for establishing compliance have been developed in the us these plans identify which non compliant hardware and software will be corrected  upgraded or replaced  the timetable and resource requirements to achieve those objectives and estimated associated costs 
remediation and testing activities are under way at both pepsi cola and frito lay 
most of our larger international operations have made similar progress  while some of our smaller international operations  which are generally less automated  are still developing their strategies 
we do not expect year spending to materially affect consolidated profitability or liquidity 
this expectation assumes that our existing forecast of costs to be incurred contemplates all significant actions required and that we will not be obligated to incur significant year related costs on behalf of our customers or suppliers 
about of the total estimated spending represents replacement systems that  in addition to being year compliant  provide significantly enhanced capability which will benefit operations in future years 
results of operations consolidated review net sales rose million or in  reflecting volume gains  partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation 
net sales rose billion or in  reflecting net volume gains and higher effective net pricing including the effect of product  package and country mix in both of our business segments 
these gains were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact 
volume gains in both years were driven by worldwide snack foods and north american beverages

the decline in ongoing operating profit also reflects lapping gains from the sale of an investment in a bottling cooperative and a settlement made with a supplier 
international net sales declined million 
the decline was due to unfavorable currency translation effects  primarily driven by spain and japan 
bcs increased 
strong double digit growth in china  the philippines and india was partially offset by double digit declines in brazil  venezuela and south africa 
the declines in venezuela and south africa reflect the impact of the unexpected loss of our bottler in august and the cessation of our joint venture operation  respectively 
in november  we entered into a new joint venture to replace the venezuelan bottler 
total concentrate shipments to franchisees increased at about the same rate as their bcs 
reported operating losses declined million 
ongoing operating results improved by million  reflecting a small profit in compared to a loss in the increase in ongoing operating results was driven by lower manufacturing costs  reduced net losses from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and lower g a expenses 
operating results also benefited from the lapping of s higher than normal expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet adjustments and actions 
the lower manufacturing costs were primarily due to favorable raw material costs and lower depreciation resulting from certain businesses held for disposal

s d expenses grew at the same rate as sales and volume 
profit growth was aided by lapping charges taken in  primarily for losses on supply contracts  take or pay co packing penalties and a write down of excess co packing assets 
a gain on the sale of an investment in a bottling cooperative and a settlement with a supplier for purchases made in prior years also helped profit growth 
benefits of approximately million related to the us restructuring were achieved in due to the centralization of purchasing and improved administrative and business processes 
all benefits from the restructuring will be reinvested in the business 
international in we began to implement a new strategy to focus on building our core business in markets in which we are already strong and in certain emerging markets 
decisions were made accordingly to dispose of certain businesses and to restructure operations  resulting in unusual impairment and restructuring charges 
liabilities associated with the restructuring charge were expected to be paid by the end of and the restructuring was expected to generate about million in savings in and about million a year thereafter

core brands  excluding their low fat and no fat versions  had mid single digit growth led by double digit growth in lay s brand potato chips and strong double digit growth in tostitos brand tortilla chips 
operating profit grew million 
the increase reflects the volume growth and the higher effective net pricing  which exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising support 
the growth rate of promotional price allowances moderated in the fourth quarter 
these gains were partially offset by higher operating and manufacturing costs and increased administrative expenses 
the increased operating costs reflect increased s d and a m 
s d and manufacturing costs both reflect capacity costs and some inefficiencies incurred to capture the volume opportunities created when anheuser busch exited the salty snack food business 
these inefficiencies began to moderate in the fourth quarter 
the increase in operating expenses coupled with higher g a expenses  partially reflect investment spending to sustain strong volume growth 
this increased investment spending  including costs of developing and testing new products  was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non core business 
international net sales increased million

consolidated cash flows pepsico s consolidated cash and cash equivalents increased billion over the prior year reflecting a significant increase in cash provided by discontinued operations  partially offset by increased cash outflows to reduce debt  increase our investment portfolios and repurchase shares 
net cash provided by operating activities rose million or to billion in  driven by increased income before all noncash charges and credits 
cash flow growth from operating working capital was reduced by the year over year change in accounts payable and other current liabilities  primarily due to lapping restructuring accruals recorded in the fourth quarter of net cash used for investing activities nearly doubled in to billion  primarily reflecting a billion swing in our short term investment portfolio activity  partially offset by million of increased proceeds from sales of businesses and reduced capital spending of million 
the change in our short term investment portfolio activity primarily reflects investing a portion of the cash flows provided by discontinued operations 
this compares to when we repatriated the proceeds from our maturing investments in puerto rico as a result of the small business job protection act of this tax law eliminated our exemption from us federal income tax on investment income generated in puerto rico 
the repatriated proceeds were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper debt 
the cash flow from sales of businesses in primarily reflects the sale of international bottling operations and our investment in a non core international snack food business 
lower capital spending was driven by north american snack foods 
the decline reflects the lapping of capital spending incurred to capture volume opportunities created when anheuser busch exited the salty snack food business  partially offset by new product related spending 
spending on acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is expected to increase in net cash used for financing activities more than doubled to billion in the increase primarily reflects increased net debt repayments of billion and share repurchases 
share repurchase activity in millions cost   shares repurchased number of shares of shares outstanding at beginning of year at december   million shares were available under the current repurchase authority granted by our board of directors 
net cash flow provided by discontinued operations increased billion in the significant increase primarily reflects a billion cash distribution received from tricon just prior to the restaurant spin off 
in addition  it reflects after tax cash proceeds of billion associated with the sale of pfs and the non core us restaurant businesses  the effects of refranchising restaurants and other operating activities 
free cash flow free cash flow is a measure we use internally to evaluate our cash flow performance and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

the billion increase in free cash flow in largely reflects our strategic initiative to exit the restaurant business 
in addition  free cash flow from continuing operations nearly doubled with improved cash flows from operating activities  larger proceeds arising from the sale of businesses and reduced capital spending 
both continuing and discontinued operations contributed to the million or increase in the free cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources at year end  billion of short term borrowings were reclassified as long term  reflecting our intent and ability  through the existence of our unused revolving credit facilities  to refinance these borrowings 
our unused credit facilities  which exist largely to support the issuances of short term debt  were billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
annually  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon the mutual consent of pepsico and the lending institutions 
we reduced our credit facilities by million at year end due to decreased borrowing needs 
our net debt level  which reflects the pro forma remittance of investment portfolios net of related taxes as a reduction of total debt  and leverage at year end were lower than prior years 
we plan to gradually releverage over time 
our strong cash generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world
