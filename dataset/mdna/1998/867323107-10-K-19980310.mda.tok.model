acquisitions during  the registrant acquired the remaining portions of leach international corporation s automated power management system product line 
the electric load management technology and related business was purchased from leach during the leach acquisition provides sundstrand with the capability of supplying a complete electrical system on airframes 
in  the registrant also purchased from labinal sa its interest in auxiliary power international corporation and related assets 
subsequent to december   the registrant acquired the business and assets  and assumed certain liabilities of ansimag  inc ansimag  a manufacturer of non metallic  magnetically driven  sealless pumps 
the registrant also purchased maso process pumpen gmbh maso  located in germany 
maso  which concentrates its sales efforts in europe  designs  develops and manufactures pumps used in the food processing and pharmaceutical industries  using the same technology as the sine r pump product line sold by registrant 
robin industries sa robin was also acquired by the registrant subsequent to december  robin is located in france and manufactures mixers for industrial applications 
foreign operations and activity the registrant has been expanding its international activities during the past several years  in part through joint venture operations  acquisitions  and the development of foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  the registrant enters into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to protect specific assets and liabilities and certain cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result  foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not expected to have a material impact on the registrant s financial condition or results of operations 
for further information related to foreign currency forward contracts see the summary of significant accounting policies note on pages and and the financial instruments with off balance sheet risk note on pages and the registrant continues to explore a variety of strategies to expand its international presence  including joint ventures and distribution arrangements 
markets in areas with high growth potential  such as the asia pacific region and latin america  are the primary focus of the registrant s efforts 
the registrant believes the current volatility in the asian financial markets will have an adverse effect on the future results of its operations and the estimated impact has been factored into the registrant s forecast which is discussed in the outlook section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages and unfilled orders unfilled orders increased by million to  million at december   of which million are not expected to be filled in unfilled orders at december  were million 
unfilled orders in the aerospace segment increased by approximately percent from while industrial segment unfilled orders decreased approximately four percent 
aerospace unfilled orders at december  are expected to decline slightly from december  and industrial unfilled orders are expected to remain flat 
auxiliary power units the registrant s power systems product line includes auxiliary power units apus and environmental control systems developed and produced for both the military and commercial aerospace markets 
since  the registrant has participated in the development and marketing of a family of apus to serve the commercial airline transport market 
initial entry into this market has required substantial investment by the registrant 
the registrant continues to project near and long term growth opportunities in both commercial oem sales and the aftermarket business 
major successes included boeing s commitment to the boeing aircraft on which the registrant s apu is sole sourced  being named the apu supplier for the embraer  which is gaining acceptance in the new passenger regional jet market  and the registrant s successful bid for the us airways apu contract for their fleet of a family of aircraft  which could cover up to aircraft 
additional investment in the product line is expected  but at a lower rate than in prior years  as the family of existing apus is applied to a limited number of new aircraft platforms 
impact of year the registrant is working to correct its year issue  which if not resolved could result in the failure of a variety of systems or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the registrant s assessment process related to the year issue has been divided into the following categories business operating systems examples include accounting and treasury  other operating systems examples include engineering  computer aided drafting and environmental systems  suppliers customers  and products 
following is the current status of each category 
business operating systems in  the registrant began the assessment and modification process to address the year issue 
based on a completed assessment of all business operating systems  the registrant determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly  in the year and thereafter 
the registrant believes that with modifications to existing software and  in some cases  conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the registrant 
the registrant is utilizing both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year modifications 
the registrant estimates the modification and replacement plan is approximately percent complete and anticipates the majority of the systems will be year ready by december   with all systems being revised or replaced by june the total cost of this portion of the year project is estimated to be between million and million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the registrant has incurred approximately million related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts on  its year project  and the development of a plan and systems modifications 
other operating systems the registrant is in the process of finalizing its assessment of year issues associated with other operating systems and expects to complete the assessment phase and establish an action plan by june the registrant further expects to complete all necessary revisions or replacements of these systems by june preliminary cost estimates for addressing these systems are not currently available 
suppliers customers the registrant has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the registrant s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
the failure of the systems of such companies could adversely effect the registrant s operations 
products the registrant is in the process of determining its exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold  but does not believe any exposure would have a material adverse affect on the registrant s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the costs of the project and the date on which the registrant believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
these estimates may not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the registrant s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
interest rate risk the registrant s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the registrant s long term debt obligations 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity and estimated fair value for the registrant s debt obligations as of december  fair thereafter total value dollar amounts in millions notes payable variable rate average interest rate long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate foreign currency risk the registrant uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure to foreign currency volatility 
these contracts limit the registrant s exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
financial instruments are not held or issued for trading purposes 
on contracts which qualify for hedge accounting of a firm commitment  a net investment in a foreign entity  or an intercompany loan of a long term nature  gains and losses are deferred and included in the measurement of the hedged transaction upon settlement 
foreign currency forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
the table below provides information about the registrant s foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts 
the table presents the contractual amount by year in which the contracts expire at the contract exchange rates  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and the estimated fair value of these contracts as of december  contractual amount average estimated contract fair total rate value amounts in millions buy contracts british pound sterling singapore dollar other various total contractual amount average estimated contract fair total rate value amounts in millions sell contracts french franc other various total environmental matters for a detailed discussion  see the environmental matters note on pages and liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at december   compared with million at december  the million increase was due primarily to lower restructuring liabilities and higher inventories and other current assets  partially offset by higher notes payable  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
inventories increased in response to higher sales and order activity in the aerospace segment 
the investment in higher inventories was funded with increased notes payable and accounts payable 
the significant increase in other accrued liabilities resulted from higher warranty accruals  increased loss contract reserves  and higher advanced payments received from customers  all of which are a result of the previously mentioned growth in sales and order activity in the aerospace segment 
other current assets increased primarily as a result of the advance funding of a trust for incurred but not reported health care claims 
net cash flow from operating activities increased to million in from million in the growth in cash flow from operations is due primarily to higher net earnings and lower deferred tax assets resulting from the realization of tax planning strategies  partially offset by the increase in working capital previously discussed 
net cash flow from operating activities in decreased to million from million in excluding the restructuring charges and related items  operating cash flow did not change materially year over year as the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were substantially offset by higher net earnings and the effect of increased accrued expenses 
the increase in accrued expenses in  excluding fluctuations in restructuring reserves  was due primarily to increases in advanced payments received from customers and post retirement benefit liabilities

on february   the registrant s board of directors authorized a two for one stock split payable as a percent stock dividend which was distributed on march   to shareholders of record on march  shareholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split in prior periods by reclassifying from retained earnings to common stock the par value of the additional shares arising from the split 
in addition  all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of the registrant s common stock have been restated to reflect the split 
on june   the registrant was authorized by its board of directors to issue up to an additional million of long term debt 
during the fourth quarter of  the registrant arranged a private shelf facility with the prudential insurance company of america which will allow it quick access to the private debt market through november on february   the registrant filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which will facilitate quick access to the public debt market 
on january   the registrant s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of its common stock  bringing the total authorized for repurchase to million shares 
the registrant had purchased approximately million shares through december  at a total purchase price of million 
in addition  approximately  shares have been repurchased through february  funds for the repurchases were provided by the registrant s commercial paper program and operating activities 
the registrant will consider a variety of options for the repurchase of the shares  from time to time  including open market purchases or dutch auctions 
the registrant currently intends to hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
the registrant uses debt to the extent internally generated cash flow is insufficient to meet its requirements 
accordingly  the ratio of its total debt to total capital is important since it indicates the registrant s capacity to absorb additional debt 
this ratio was percent at the end of  compared with percent at the end of  and percent at the end of the registrant expects that for its total debt to total capital ratio will be in the percent to percent range 
capital expenditures  cash dividend payments  and working capital requirements will be financed from the registrant s continuing sources of liquidity 
the registrant remains actively involved in evaluating potential acquisitions  which may be financed with internal cash flow  debt  stock  or a combination thereof 
capital expenditures excluding leased equipment consisting of normal replacements of property  plant  and equipment and increased investment in machinery and equipment related to increasing volume and new manufacturing process strategies were million in compared with million in capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately million in  as the new manufacturing process strategies program and an information systems project continue in the aerospace segment 
total research and development expenditures for the years   and were million  million  and million  respectively  of which million  million  and million  respectively  was funded by customers 
the registrant expects research and development expenditures to be approximately million  including approximately million of which will be customer funded

in the future  the registrant intends to continue in this area of excellence while focusing on new product and market opportunities 
the emphasis will be on sales growth through the development or acquisition of products of like technology and profit potential 
additionally  the registrant is focusing on improving its manufacturing capabilities and processes so that its ability to manufacture and serve its customers will continue to be important competitive advantages 
the new business and manufacturing process strategies will be focused through decentralized organizations 
focused business units and enterprises will be used to implement customized improvements in work flow  cycle time reductions  and customer responsiveness 
outlook the following discussion contains forward looking information which is subject to market risks and opportunities that could have a material impact on actual results  and accordingly should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language set forth in the registrant s most recent report on form k which is on file with the securities and exchange commission 
aerospace the sustained strength in commercial aircraft order rates during will produce increased shipments to oem customers during  while aftermarket shipments will be up slightly 
aerospace military sales are expected to show continued growth in as a result of increased shipments to foreign military customers 
industrial the registrant s industrial businesses are expected to be up slightly in a healthy us industrial economy and improved european markets may be partially offset by the volatility in asian markets 
in addition  the registrant s industrial operating profits are expected to improve as benefits from the restructuring  which began in  of sullair europe s air compressor business continue to be realized 
forecast while the registrant is concerned about the recent economic turmoil in asia  the impact on the registrant so far has been minimal 
taking into consideration the uncertainties of this situation  the registrant has adjusted its projection accordingly 
assuming the situation in asia does not deteriorate materially from this point  the registrant projects that sales should increase between percent and percent and our operating profit should be in the percent range 
as a result  we expect to generate diluted earnings per share of between to  excluding restructuring costs  one time items and any future share repurchases 
were it not for the asian crisis and the related impact  the diluted earnings per share forecast would have been approximately 
higher 
the registrant s goal for the years beyond is to increase earnings per share by at least percent per year 
for  the registrant plans to invest approximately million in capital expenditures and expend approximately million on research and development 
even with this high level of research and development and capital spending  the registrant expects to generate operating cash flow after capital expenditures of between million and million in the registrant s goal is to increase cash flow in and by at least million per year 
the registrant will continue to invest its cash for optimal returns  either by investing in the company or by growing the company through acquisitions 
the registrant expects that its total debt to total capital ratio will be in the range of percent to percent at year end total aerospace sales are projected to increase between percent and percent for with commercial oem sales projected to increase by between percent and percent 
commercial aftermarket sales should increase by about percent 
military oem sales are expected to increase between percent and percent and military aftermarket sales should be up by percent to percent 
because of the and acquisitions and the strategic initiatives spending  the aerospace segment operating profit margin is expected to be reduced by about two percentage points 
despite this reduction  the aerospace segment is expected to generate an operating profit margin in excess of percent for  which should result in aerospace operating profit growing by approximately percent 
the registrant expects industrial segment sales to grow by between percent and percent in the industrial segment operating profit margin is expected to be between percent and percent  which should result in industrial segment operating profit growing by percent to percent
