item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this document 
overview since the company s founding in  a primary focus of its operations has been research and development 
achievement of successful research and development and commercialization of products derived from such efforts is subject to high levels of risk and significant resource commitments 
the company has a history of operating losses and expects to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next few years  as it continues to develop its proprietary products  devote significant resources to preclinical studies  clinical trials  and manufacturing and to defend its patents and other proprietary rights 
the company s revenues to date have consisted principally of research and development funding  licensing and signing fees and milestone payments from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies under collaborative research and development and patent licensing agreements 
these revenues may vary considerably from reporting period to reporting period and revenues in any period may not be predictive of revenues in any subsequent period  and variations may be significant depending on the terms of the particular agreements 
in  the company began receiving royalties from sales of zenapaxr by hoffmann la roche inc  including its affiliates roche 
the company is dependent upon the further development  regulatory and marketing efforts of roche with respect to zenapax and there can be no assurance that roche s further development  regulatory and marketing efforts will be successful  including  without limitation  if and when regulatory approvals in various countries may be obtained and whether or how quickly zenapax might be adopted by the medical community 
the company began to receive royalties based on revenue from sales of zenapax by roche in  with royalties based on us sales paid to the company on a quarterly basis and international sales on a semi annual basis 
the company intends to recognize royalty revenues when royalty reports are received from roche and the company s other collaborative partners 
this method of recognizing royalty revenues from the company s licensees  taken together with the unpredictable timing of payments of non recurring licensing and signing fees and milestones under new and existing collaborative research and development and patent licensing agreements  is likely to result in significant fluctuations in revenues in quarterly and yearly periods 
although the company anticipates entering into new collaborations and patent licensing agreements from time to time  the company presently does not anticipate realizing non royalty revenue from its new and proposed collaborations and agreements at levels commensurate with the non royalty revenue historically recognized under its older collaborations 
moreover  as the company expands its business activities  advancing potential products in clinical development  the company anticipates that its operating expenses will generally continue to increase significantly as the company dedicates more resources to its research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical activity  and administrative and patent activities 
accordingly  in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or patent licensing agreements  significant royalties on sales of zenapax and other products licensed under the company s intellectual property rights  or other sources  the company expects to incur substantial operating losses in the foreseeable future as certain of its earlier stage potential products move into later stage clinical development  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development  as the company invests in additional facilities or manufacturing capacity  as the company defends or prosecutes its patents and patent applications and as the company invests in research or acquires additional technologies or businesses 
contract revenues from research and development are recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contracts 
revenues from achievement of milestone events are recognized when the funding party agrees that the scientific or clinical results stipulated in the agreement have been met 
deferred revenue arises principally due to timing of cash payments received under research and development contracts 
the company s collaborative  humanization and patent licensing agreements with third parties provide for the payment of royalties to the company based on net sales of the licensed product under the agreement 
the agreements generally provide for royalty reports to the company following completion of each calendar quarter or semi annual period and royalty revenue is recognized when royalty reports are received from the third party

the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others  royalties from roche s marketing of zenapax  the ability of the company to enter into additional patent licensing arrangements  the progress of the company s product candidates in clinical trials  the ability of the company s collaborative partners to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market the company s products  the continued or additional support by collaborative partners or other third parties of research and clinical trials  enhancement of existing and investment in new research and development programs  the time required to gain regulatory approvals  the resources the company devotes to self funded products  manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  the ability of the company to obtain and retain funding from third parties under collaborative agreements  the development of internal marketing and sales capabilities  the demand for the company s potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by the company  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in order to develop and commercialize its potential products the company may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing may only be available on terms dilutive to existing stockholders 
the company believes that existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs through at least year compliance the company has conducted a preliminary review of its internal operations and inquired of certain of its key vendors to assess the appropriate resource commitments and contingency plans that may be required to maintain the company s computer systems after december  based on this preliminary review  the company does not believe that modifications to existing computer systems to provide for proper functioning with respect to dates in the year and thereafter will pose significant operational problems or require significant financial commitments on behalf of the company 
this belief is based on a preliminary review and certain related estimates and assumptions of future events such as the timely completion or availability of upgrades or modifications to the company s software and computer systems as specified by its vendors  and the continued availability of certain resources and internal capabilities  including without limitation the employees of the company responsible for the information systems and manufacturing software used in the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that a complete review of the company s operations will not identify additional efforts that may have a material impact on the future operating results or financial condition of the company  that management s estimates can be achieved  that certain software used by the company will be upgraded or modified and made available to the company in a timely manner  that management s assumptions regarding the further growth of the company are complete or accurate or that the required resources and capabilities of the company to address this potential issue will continue to be available in a timely manner 
moreover  the company s operations and development program are dependent upon certain third party vendors who perform services for the company  as well as certain agencies and organizations such as the us food and drug administration and foreign regulatory authorities 
these third party vendors  agencies and authorities may have difficulties or problems in timely upgrading or modifying their internal operations and computer systems to address the year issue and there can be no assurance that the systems of these vendors  agencies and authorities will be timely upgraded or modified in a manner that would not adversely affect the company s business
