on february   the company entered into an agreement with aero international regional the ba j agreement to acquire new j aircraft  and into a related agreement that gave the company permission to refinance through third parties up to fifteen previously delivered j aircraft that were under leases supported by british aerospace 
the new aircraft were to be delivered under long term leases with british aerospace  but were also eligible for third party financing 
four of the new aircraft had been delivered as of may   when british aerospace announced that it would no longer manufacture the j as part of its regular product line 
on july   the company and british aerospace amended the ba j agreement to cancel any further deliveries of j s pursuant to the ba j agreement

in addition  the faa from time to time amends its regulations which such amended regulations may impose additional regulatory burdens on the company such as the installation of new safety related items collision and windshear avoidance systems and enhanced flight data recorders 
depending upon the scope of the faa s order and amended regulations  these requirements may cause the company to incur substantial  unanticipated expenses 
capital equipment and debt service in the company anticipates capital spending of approximately million consisting primarily of million to own two crjs and one j aircraft  million for spare parts  engines and equipment  and million for other capital assets 
the company anticipates that it will be able to arrange financing for the aircraft and spares through a combination of manufacturer and third party financing arrangements on favorable terms  although there is no certainty that such financing will be available or in place before the commencement of deliveries 
the company currently has an agreement in principle from a third party for approximately million in debt financing associated with the purchase of nine crj s to be delivered in and debt service for is estimated to be approximately million reflecting increased borrowings related to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes and the purchase of four j aircraft 
the foregoing amount does not include additional debt that may be required for the financing of the crj spare parts and engines 
the company believes that  in the absence of unusual circumstances  its cash flow from operations  the accounts receivable credit facility  and other available equipment financing will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements for the next twelve months
