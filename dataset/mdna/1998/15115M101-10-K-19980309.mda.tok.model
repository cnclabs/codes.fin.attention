item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors set forth in risk factors that may affect future operating performance hereunder and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company intends to deploy and operate a series of wireless data communications networks pursuant to services agreements with utilities and other parties including new power market participants to earn recurring revenues by providing nmr services and to use the networks to support a variety of non utility applications 
the company employs two basic strategies in the deployment of its networks saturation deployments for providing nmr services to existing utilities  and broad deployments for providing nmr services to other parties including new power market participants 
under the company s saturation deployment strategy  the company builds out its wan and lan concurrently in order to cover every meter in a utility s designated service area 
the saturation deployment strategy has proven effective because it allows coverage of all of the energy consumers in those service areas 
under the company s broad deployment strategy  the company first deploys its wan in service areas where the largest consumers of energy are located and where energy consumers and other power market participants are most likely to value the company s services and or to concentrate their marketing efforts 
as contracts for the provision of nmr services are obtained  the company builds out its lan on an incremental basis as necessary to service those customers or for advanced coverage of certain areas 
both the lan and wan can be further expanded incrementally as additional business outside the existing coverage areas is obtained 
broad deployment offers energy service providers who lack the established utilities designated geographical customer bases the flexibility to build as they grow or to pursue particular market niches 
it also offers established utilities who are not yet prepared to commit their resources to a long term saturation deployment project the opportunity to cover a portion of their customers initially and to increase coverage in their service areas over time  potentially to all of their meters 
by using networks deployed under either strategy  the company is also able i to offer nmr information metering services directly to energy consumers  to the extent that the information provided by such services is not being made available to them by their own utility or energy service provider  ii to offer sub metering nmr services to industrial and commercial customers who desire to monitor the energy consumption of particular hvac system components  individual manufacturing processes or pieces of equipment  individual departments  etc  and iii to offer a range of non utility wireless data communication services for such applications as home security  remote status monitoring of vending machines  office equipment and parking meters  and remote control of traffic lights 
the company s business strategy has affected and will continue to affect its financial condition and results of operations as follows composition of revenues 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees earned under services agreements related to its wireless communications networks 
under the company s existing services agreements with utilities  the company receives monthly nmr service fees based on the number of endpoint devices that are in revenue service during the applicable month 
uneven revenue growth 
the timing and amount of the company s future revenues will depend upon its ability to obtain additional services agreements with utilities and other parties including new power market participants and upon the company s ability to deploy and operate successfully its wireless communications networks for utility and non utility applications 
new services agreements are expected to be obtained on an irregular basis  and there cellnet may be prolonged periods during which the company does not enter into any additional services agreements or other arrangements 
as a result  the company expects that its revenues will not grow smoothly over time  but will increase unevenly as the company enters into new services agreements and other commercial relationships  and may decrease sharply in the event that any of its existing services agreements are terminated or not renewed 
see risk factors that may affect future performance uncertainty of future revenues  need for additional services contracts and fluctuating operating results 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s future revenues will depend on the number of new services agreements with established utilities and other parties including new power market participants and on the amount of nmr services to be provided thereunder 
the company s only existing contracts are with established utilities 
during  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from its contracts with kcpl and ue 
the utility industry is historically characterized by long purchasing cycles and cautious decision making  and purchases of the company s services are  to a substantial extent  deferrable in the event that utilities seek to limit capital expenditures or decide to defer such purchases for other reasons 
only a limited number of utilities have made a commitment to purchase the company s services to date 
although the uncertainty surrounding proposed regulatory changes in some states may have caused  and may continue to cause  additional delays in purchasing decisions by established utilities  the company believes that implementation of utility deregulation will ultimately accelerate the utility decision making process 
the company believes that it will enter into additional services contracts with other utilities and other parties including new power market participants  however  if the company s services do not gain widespread industry acceptance  its revenues would not increase significantly after services contracts for existing network systems have been fully installed 
with the advent of utility industry deregulation  the company is seeking opportunities to provide its nmr services to other parties including new power market participants 
the company believes it is well positioned to offer competitive advantages to established utilities and other parties including new power market participants 
the company has entered into several contracts with new power market participants and others for the provision of nmr services 
however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into contracts covering a sufficient number of meters to recoup its costs of deployment  on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
the company also anticipates that  under contracts with new power market participants  it would build out its networks  at least in part  before the capacity is fully committed 
see business business strategy 
for these reasons  the company s ability to obtain financing for the capital expenditures associated with these contracts may be limited  although the company also believes that it will be able to defer a significant portion of the capital expenditures by building out its networks incrementally as needed  and that the new power market participants would lease or acquire the endpoints from the company  reducing the company s costs 
the company also anticipates that its contracts with new power market participants and other parties will be shorter term than those it has entered into with established utilities  and may therefore not fully cover the costs of network build out and associated operating costs 
the company intends to reduce this risk by marketing its services to a wide range of new power market participants and other parties  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such marketing efforts  or that the new power market participants will be successful in capturing any significant share of the energy service market 
the company s long term business plan contemplates the generation of a significant percentage of future revenues from non utility services 
the company believes its future ability to service its indebtedness and to achieve profitability will be affected by its success in generating substantial revenues from such additional services 
the company currently has no services contracts which provide for the implementation of such services  and the company has not yet deployed such services on a commercial scale 
in addition  unless the company is successful cellnet in deploying its wireless networks in targeted service areas  the company may not be able to offer any such services in such areas or may be able to offer these services only on a limited basis 
revenues lag network deployment 
the company expects to realize network service revenue under a services agreement with a utility or new power market participant only when a portion of the network is installed and they have begun billing their customers based upon the nmr data obtained 
the company expects that its receipt of network service revenue will lag the signing of the related services agreements by a minimum of six months and that it will generally take two to four years to complete installation of a network after each services agreement has been signed 
a network s service revenues are not expected to exceed the company s capital investments and expenses incurred to deploy such network for several years 
as of december   the company had approximately  meters under long term contracts  of which approximately  meters were in revenue service 
the company signed agreements with kcpl and ue in august and august  respectively  and did not receive its first revenue under the kcpl and ue services agreements until september and may  respectively 
the company has completed the installation of its nmr network for kcpl and had installed approximately  meters on the network by december  the company expects to add an additional  meters to the kcpl network in which would be added to the total number of meters in revenue service upon acceptance by kcpl for billing purposes 
the remaining  meters under contract with kcpl may be automated or read manually 
as of december   the company completed the on line deployment of approximately  meters to the ue network 
the company began the installation of both the nsp and puget networks in august and began receiving revenue from puget in january the company has also successfully completed a demonstration project with pg e in san francisco pursuant to which the company has installed a network that will cover approximately  electric and gas meters 
pg e has acknowledged that the data collection  cost savings  customer service and other objectives of the demonstration network have been met 
in september  the company entered into a services contract with ip l for the installation of its nmr network that will cover approximately  meters 
installation of the initial portion of the ip l network was completed in november as additional segments of the company s networks are installed and used by its customers for billing purposes  the company expects to realize a corresponding increase in its network service revenues 
however  if the company is able to deploy successfully an increasing number of networks over the next few years  the operating losses created by this lag in revenues  the negative cash flow resulting from such operating losses  and the capital expenditures expected to be required in connection with the installation of such networks  are expected to widen for a period of time and will continue until the operating cash flow from installed networks exceeds the costs of deploying and operating the additional networks 
impact of rapid expansion 
the company will be required to invest significant amounts of capital in its networks and to incur substantial and increasing sales and marketing expenses before receiving any return on such expenditures through network service revenues 
the company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company does not expect significant revenues relative to anticipated operating costs during and expects to incur substantial and increasing operating losses and negative net cash flow after capital expenditures for the foreseeable future as it expands and installs additional networks 
the company does not expect positive cash flow after capital expenditures from its nmr services operations for several years 
the company will require substantial capital to fund operating cash flow deficits and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and expects to finance these requirements through significant additional external financing 
see risk factors that may affect future performance history and continuation of operating losses and substantial leverage and ability to service debt  substantial future capital needs 
cellnet interest income 
the company has earned substantial amounts of interest income on short term investments of the proceeds of its financing activities 
the company expects to utilize substantially all of its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in deploying its wireless communications networks  in continuing research and development activities related thereto  in related selling and marketing activities and for general and administrative purposes 
as such funds are expended  interest income is expected to decrease 
results of operations revenues revenues for the three years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
revenues prior to were attributable primarily to product sales and development and other contract revenues unrelated to the company s current focus of providing nmr services that were largely non recurring 
during  kcpl and ue accounted for and of the company s revenues  respectively 
during  kcpl and ue accounted for and of the company s revenues  respectively 
revenues for declined  from  primarily as a result of the transition from product sales to network service revenues 
during  nsp and kcpl accounted for and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the company s nmr service revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and  respectively 
the company generally realizes service revenues under its services agreements only when its networks or portions thereof are successfully installed and operating and its clients begin billing their own customers or begin using the nmr services provided 
revenues are expected to increase as the company continues to install its networks  the networks or portions thereof become operational  and its clients begin billing their own customers or begin using the nmr services provided 
due primarily to the nature  amount and timing of revenues received to date  no meaningful period to period comparisons can be made 
revenues received during the years ended december   and  respectively  are not reliable indicators of revenues that might be expected in the future 
cost of revenues for the years ended december   and cost of revenues primarily consisted of network operations costs 
cost of revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues was driven by increasing costs of providing network services  due primarily to growth in the number of employees and associated costs necessary for network monitoring operations at customer sites and at the company s headquarters  network deployment management and customer training 
costs of network services also include the increased installation  applications and rf engineering staffing at the company s headquarters to support anticipated additional utility contracts 
network services do not currently generate a profit as the company has not yet achieved a scale of services sufficient to cover network costs 
the company will incur significant and increasing costs primarily attributable to network operation and depreciation 
once a network has been fully installed  costs associated with generating network revenues will consist primarily of maintaining a monitoring center for such network  network depreciation and miscellaneous maintenance and operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses  consisting of research and development  marketing and sales  general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization expenses  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses on a period to period basis is attributable to the company s rapid growth and to increasing research and development and marketing and cellnet sales expenditures 
the company expects to continue to spend a significant portion of its resources on research and development activities for the foreseeable future 
marketing and sales costs are expected to increase moderately over current levels as the company continues its efforts to sign new services agreements 
general and administrative costs are expected to increase over time in line with the company s expected growth and expected to increase moderately for the next few years in connection with the planned installation of a new enterprise information system commencing in the second quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses are attributable largely to continuing system software  firmware and equipment development costs  prototype manufacturing  testing  personnel costs  consulting fees  and supplies 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company s networks include certain software applications which are integral to their operation 
the costs to develop such software have not been capitalized as the company believes its software development is essentially completed when technological feasibility of the software is established and or development of the related network hardware is complete 
research and development expenses were million net of expenses reimbursable by bcn of million for technology migration costs  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development spending increases in  and reflect primarily additions to the company s engineering staff and costs associated with development of processes to retrofit utility meters for use in the cellnet network 
the company expects that research and development expenses will increase moderately in the near term for additional investments in research and development projects and in connection with the establishment of international operations 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist principally of personnel costs  including commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel  advertising  trade show and other promotional costs 
marketing and sales expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses have increased due to the company s accelerated efforts to sign new services agreements and a significantly larger advertising program 
the company expects a moderate increase in marketing and sales expenses over current levels as the company continues its efforts to sign new services agreements 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include compensation paid to general management and administrative personnel costs  travel  and communications and other general administrative expenses  including fees for professional services 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase over time in line with its expected growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the company s networks in progress  including both equipment manufactured by the company and systems partially installed in the field  property and leasehold improvements 
depreciation and amortization expense has increased as a result of increased additions to networks in progress  property and leasehold improvements year to year 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate the company accounts for its investment in bcn  which began operations in  using the equity method 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million as its share of bcn s losses 
the cellnet company expects to recognize increased losses in the future from its share of bcn s losses as bcn expands its operations 
interest income and expense prior to june  the company funded its liquidity needs primarily from the issuance of equity securities 
in june and november  the company issued and sold a total of million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the company s senior notes due the notes and related warrants the warrants for proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million 
on october   the company completed an initial public offering the initial public offering in which it sold  shares of its common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the company 
in connection with the initial public offering  the company also received million in proceeds from the cash exercise of the warrants the warrant exercise to purchase  shares of cellnet s common stock 
in addition  on october   the company completed certain direct placements the direct placements in which it sold  shares of its common stock for proceeds of approximately million 
in september  the company issued and sold a total of approximately million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior notes due the notes and warrants the warrants for proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  million of the issue price for the notes and warrants was issued in exchange for all of the company s notes 
the company has earned interest income on the invested proceeds from the notes  notes  the initial public offering  warrant exercise and direct placements 
the company has also incurred significant interest expense from the amortization of the original issue discount on the notes and the notes 
interest expense will increase significantly in future periods as a result of increased accretion of a larger original issue discount balance from the issuance of the notes 
interest income has been and will continue to be received by the company from the short term investment of proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt securities pending the use of such proceeds by the company for capital expenditures and operating and other expenses 
interest income is expected to be highly variable over time as proceeds from the issue and sale of additional equity and debt securities are received and as funds are used by the company in its business 
interest income for the three years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
no interest on the notes is payable prior to april  thereafter  until maturity on october   interest will be payable semi annually in arrears on each april and october the carrying amount of the notes accretes from the date of issue and the company s interest expense includes such accretion 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company has not provided for or paid federal income taxes due to the company s net losses 
a nominal provision has been recorded for various state minimum income and franchise taxes 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to offset future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
the extent to which the loss carryforwards can be used to offset future taxable income may be limited  depending on the extent of ownership changes within any three year period as provided in the tax reform act of and the california conformity act of such state carryforwards will expire between and such federal carryforwards will expire cellnet between and equity issuances in april and the initial public offering in triggered such limitations on loss carryforwards 
as of december   approximately million of net operating losses remain limited to an annual usage of approximately million for federal tax purposes 
based upon the company s history of operating losses and the expiration dates of the loss carryforwards  the company has recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of its net deferred tax assets 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt on september   the company exchanged million aggregate value at maturity of notes and warrants for million in new proceeds and the extinguishment of its million aggregate value at maturity of notes 
the exchange of the notes was accounted for as an early extinguishment of debt  resulting in an extraordinary charge of million  consisting of the unamortized portion of the debt issuance cost of the notes of million  million attributable to consent fees and other costs related to the extinguishment of the notes  and accelerated accretion of interest on the notes of million 
impact of the year the company believes that its wireless data communications networks are year compliant 
accordingly  the company expects that the advent of the millennium will have no adverse effect on its network operations 
certain of the company s legacy computer information systems require modification  upgrade or replacement in order to be year compliant 
because these systems are becoming obsolete  the company has decided to replace them with a new enterprise information system to be installed commencing in the second quarter of and expects to complete installation in advance of the year the company expects to finance over several years most of the costs involved in purchasing and installing the new enterprise information system  which are estimated at approximately million for liquidity and capital resources the company requires significant amounts of capital for research and development in connection with the development of its proprietary wireless communications network and related products and services  for investments in the installation and testing of such networks and for related sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
historically  the company has satisfied its liquidity requirements primarily through external financings  including private placements of equity and debt securities and interest income derived from the investment of the proceeds of its financing activities 
in  and  net cash used in the company s operating activities totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from cash used to fund net operating losses 
in  and  net cash used for investing activities totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the company s investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of network components and inventory  the construction and installation of networks  purchases of property and equipment  and purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments 
in and  net proceeds from the sale and maturation of short term investments of million and million  respectively  were used to fund operating activities 
in  and  net cash provided by the company s financing activities totaled million  million and million  respectively  including cash provided by the private sale of the company s equity securities of million in in june and november  the company received an aggregate of million of gross cellnet proceeds million in net proceeds from the private sale of the notes and related warrants 
during  the company financed its operations primarily from the proceeds of the offering of the notes and warrants  together with interest income of million 
on october   the company completed its initial public offering in which it sold  shares of its common stock at an offering price of per share for net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the company 
in addition  on october   the company completed the direct placements in which it sold  shares of its common stock for proceeds of million 
on september   the company received an aggregate of approximately million from the sale of the notes and warrants 
all holders of outstanding notes tendered and exchanged their notes for notes having an initial accreted value of million 
warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock with an exercise price of per share were attached to the notes 
aggregate proceeds of million were attributable to the warrants 
the notes were issued at an initial accreted value of million and will fully accrete to a face value of million 
the notes were issued at a substantial discount from their aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
although interest is not payable on the notes prior to april   the carrying amount of such indebtedness will increase as the original issue discount is amortized through maturity on october  beginning october   the notes will bear interest  payable semi annually  at a rate of per annum  with payments commencing april  no principal payments on the notes are due prior to maturity on october  there is a risk that the company will not be able to refinance the notes prior to the date cash interest payments become due and payable on such notes or at their maturity date 
the company s ability to refinance the notes will depend on prevailing capital market conditions  the company s performance and financial position and the company s indebtedness  which is projected to be high 
any inability by the company to refinance the notes would limit the company s ability to meet its obligations on such notes 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
the decline of million was due to increased operating costs and the development and construction of the company s wireless communications networks  offset by proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
deployments of the company s wireless communications networks will require substantial additional capital 
as of december   the company was committed to make approximately million in capital expenditures for saturation deployment network installations during in addition  the company anticipates that it may spend as much as million in capital expenditures relating to the installation of its broad deployment network in california  although the exact amount of such expenditures will depend  in part  upon the amount of nmr and other services contracted for 
the company may make additional capital expenditures in connection with the installation of new networks  the expansion of existing networks and or an acceleration in anticipated network installation schedules 
in addition  funds will be required for a number of purposes including  but not limited to  further enhancements to the system software  firmware  hardware and other equipment to increase the speed  capacity and functionality of the system  to enhance system productivity over time and to expand the scope of utility and other network information services that may be offered on the cellnet system 
the company expects that cash used for the construction and installation of networks and for the purchase of property and equipment will increase substantially as and when the company obtains new services agreements or enters into other arrangements for the installation of its networks  and that the company will require significant amounts of additional capital from external sources 
sources of additional capital for the company and its subsidiaries may include project or conventional cellnet bank financing  including financing provided by utilities to finance the construction of networks being built out primarily for them  public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and cash generated from operating activities 
the company expects that a substantial portion of its future financing will be at the subsidiary level on a project basis 
the company expects to obtain third party financing for the construction of wireless networks  based on the projected cash flow expected to be generated from such projects 
the company expects that the recurring revenue stream from long term services contracts and other arrangements will support the amortization of debt raised for the project involved  however no assurance can be given that this will occur 
the company does not anticipate deriving any significant cash from such operations for several years 
the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  anticipated interest income  other revenues and expected sources of project financing of approximately million will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next months 
the company requires and intends to raise a substantial amount of capital in and expects that it will continue to require substantial amounts of additional capital in the future 
the extent of additional financing will depend on the success of the company s business 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses and to generate increasingly negative net cash flow during the next several years while it develops and installs its network communications systems 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company or  if available  that it can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company and within the limitations contained in the indenture or that may be contained in any additional financing arrangements 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness 
future financings may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development and expansion plans and expenditures  which could limit the ability of the company to meet its debt service requirements and could have a material adverse effect on its business and on the value of the common stock 
see risk factors that may affect future operating performance substantial leverage and ability to service debt  substantial future capital needs 
risk factors that may affect future operating performance dependence on and uncertainty of market acceptance the company s success will be almost entirely dependent on whether established utilities and other parties including new power market participants sign services contracts with cellnet or enter into other arrangements which allow cellnet to install nmr networks servicing a substantial number of meters 
because automation of utility meter reading and distribution is a relatively new and evolving market and is likely to be significantly affected by deregulation  it is difficult to predict the future growth rate and size of this market 
utilities are testing products from various suppliers for various applications  and no industry standard has been broadly adopted 
the cellnet system is one possible solution for automated meter reading and distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving the large scale adoption of its system 
in the event that the utilities or other parties including new power market participants do not adopt the company s technology  or do so less rapidly than expected by the company  the company s future results  including its ability to service its indebtedness and achieve positive cash flow or profitability  will be materially and adversely affected 
in recent competitive bids  potential electric and gas utility customers have selected competing systems to perform services offered by the company  and other parties  including energy service providers  may from time to time select competing services in the future 
see business competition 
during  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from its contracts with kcpl and ue 
any decision by a utility to utilize the company s services will involve a significant organizational  technological and cellnet financial commitment 
the utility industry historically is characterized by long purchasing cycles and cautious decision making 
utilities typically undergo numerous steps before making a final purchase decision 
these steps  which can take up to several years to complete  may include the formation of a committee to evaluate the purchase  the review of different technical options with vendors  performance and cost justifications  regulatory review and the creation and issuance of requests for quotes and proposals  as well as the utilities normal budget approval process 
although the uncertainty surrounding proposed regulatory changes in some states may have caused  and may continue to cause  additional delays in purchasing decisions by established utilities  the company believes that implementation of utility deregulation will ultimately accelerate the utility decision making process 
purchases of the company s services are  to a substantial extent  deferrable in the event that utilities seek to limit capital expenditures or decide to defer such purchases for other reasons 
only a limited number of utilities have made a commitment to purchase the company s services to date  and there can be no assurance as to when or if the company will enter into additional services contracts or that any such contracts would be on terms favorable to the company

with the advent of utility industry deregulation  the company is seeking opportunities to provide its nmr services to other parties including new power market participants 
the company believes it is well positioned to offer competitive advantages to established utilities and other parties including new power market participants 
although the company has entered into several contracts with new power market participants and other parties  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into contracts covering a sufficient number of meters to recoup its costs of deployment  on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
the company s ability to enter into contracts with other parties including new power market participants depends  in part  on the timing and type of deregulation in each state 
the company also anticipates that  under contracts with other parties including new power market participants  it would build out its networks  at least in part  before the capacity was fully committed 
see business business strategy 
for these reasons  the company s ability to obtain financing for the capital expenditures associated with these contracts may be limited 
the company believes  however  that it will be able to defer a significant portion of the required capital expenditures by building out its networks incrementally as needed  and that the new power market participants and other parties would lease or acquire the endpoints from the company  reducing the company s costs 
the company also anticipates that its contracts with new power market participants and other parties will be shorter term than those it has entered into with established utilities  and the revenues may therefore not fully cover the costs of network build out and associated operating costs 
the company intends to reduce this risk by marketing its services to a wide range of new power market participants and other parties  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such marketing efforts  or that the new power market participants and other parties will be successful in capturing any significant share of the energy service market 
uncertainty of future revenues  need for additional services contracts and fluctuating operating results the timing and amount of future revenues will depend almost entirely upon the company s ability to obtain new services agreements with established utilities and other parties including new power market participants and upon the successful deployment and operation of the company s wireless data communications networks 
the signing of any new services contracts for saturation and broad deployments is expected to occur on an irregular basis 
the company expects that it will generally take two to four years to complete the installation of each saturation deployment network after a services contract has been signed 
service revenues from both types of such networks are not expected to exceed the company s capital investments and expenses incurred to deploy and operate such networks for several years 
the company will not begin to receive recurring revenues under a services contract until portions of the network become operational  which is expected to occur in saturation deployments no earlier cellnet than six months after the execution of the applicable services contract 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected by delays or difficulties arising in the network installation process 
the cost of network deployments will be highly variable and depend upon a wide variety of factors  including radio frequency characteristics  the size of a service territory and density of endpoints within such territory  the nature and sophistication of services being provided  the cost of spectrum acquisition  local labor rates and other economic factors 
cellnet currently derives almost all of its revenues from long term services contracts with a limited number of established utilities 
the company will not generate sufficient cash flow to service its indebtedness or achieve profitability unless it enters into additional services contracts covering a significant number of additional meters 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete commercial deployments of the cellnet system under current services contracts successfully or that it will obtain enough additional services contracts on satisfactory terms for network deployments in a sufficient number of locations to allow the company to achieve adequate cash flow to service its indebtedness or achieve positive cash flow or profitability 
the company s operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of the company s control  including the rate at which established utilities and new power market participants enter into new services contracts  general economic conditions  economic conditions in the utility industry  the effects of governmental regulations and regulatory changes  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  the introduction of new services by the company or its competitors  the mix of services sold  pricing changes and new service introductions by the company and its competitors and prices charged by suppliers 
in response to a changing competitive environment  the company may elect from time to time to make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or enter into strategic relationships or investments that could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow

dependence on businesses relationships a key element of the company s business strategy is the formation of corporate relationships with leading companies 
the company is currently investing  and plans to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships 
the company believes that its success in penetrating markets for utility and non utility applications of its network will depend in large part on its ability to maintain these relationships and to cultivate additional or alternative relationships

the company will be required to pay cash interest on the notes commencing april  and repay the notes on october  cellnet intends to incur substantial additional indebtedness  primarily in connection with installing future networks 
as a result  cellnet will have substantial debt service obligations 
the company s capital expenditures will increase significantly if new services contracts are signed  and the company expects that its cash flow  in part due to increased capital expenditures  will be increasingly negative over the next several years 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service requirements will depend upon achieving significant and sustained growth in the company s cash flow  which will be affected by a number of factors  including its success in implementing its business strategy  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s ability to generate such cash flow is subject to a number of risks and contingencies 
included among these risks are the possibilities that i the company may not obtain sufficient additional services agreements or complete scheduled installations on a timely basis  ii revenues may not be generated quickly enough to meet the company s operating costs and debt service obligations  iii the operating and or capital costs associated with the installation and maintenance of the network could be higher than projected  iv the company s wireless systems could experience performance problems  or v adoption of the company s services within a network could be less widespread than anticipated 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to whether or when the company s operations will generate positive cash flow or become profitable or whether the company or its subsidiaries will at any time have sufficient resources to meet their debt service obligations 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain alternate liquidity to service its indebtedness  it will have to take actions such as to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance its indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that effecting any of these strategies would yield sufficient proceeds to make the required payments on the notes 
in particular  there is a risk that the company would be unable  if needed  to refinance the notes prior to the date cash interest payments become due and payable on the notes or at their maturity date  given uncertainty about prevailing capital market conditions  the company s then performance and financial position and the company s projected high levels of indebtedness 
such inability to refinance the notes could result in cross defaults under other indebtedness and may limit the company s ability to meet its obligations on the notes 
in addition  the degree to which the company is leveraged could have significant consequences  including  but not limited to  the following i the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development  acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes may be materially limited or impaired  ii the company s cash flow  if any  cannot be used in the company s business as a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  and iii the company s high degree of leverage may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns  may limit its ability to withstand competitive pressures and may reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
the company will require substantial additional funds for the development  commercial deployment and expansion of its networks  and for funding operating losses 
as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company intends to raise a substantial amount of additional capital in and expects that it will continue to require substantial amounts of additional capital in the future 
depending upon the number and timing of any new services agreements and upon the associated network deployment costs and schedules  the company may require additional equity or debt financing earlier than cellnet estimated in order to fund its working capital and other requirements 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  that it will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in the event that the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow and is otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments on its indebtedness  the company could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing its indebtedness 
in the event of such default  the holders of such indebtedness would have certain enforcement rights  including the right to accelerate such debt and the right to commence an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against the company 
history and continuation of operating losses the company has incurred substantial and increasing operating losses since inception 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million  primarily resulting from expenses incurred in the development of the company s wireless data communications system  marketing of the company s nmr  distribution automation and other services  the installation of its wireless data communications networks and the payment of other normal operating costs 
the company does not expect revenues to exceed anticipated operating costs during and expects to incur substantial and increasing operating losses and negative net cash flow after capital expenditures for the foreseeable future as it expands its research and development and marketing efforts and installs additional networks 
the company expects that its receipt of network service revenues will lag the signing of the related services agreements by a minimum of six months and that it will generally take two to four years to complete installation of a network after each services agreement has been signed 
the company s network service revenues from a particular network are expected to lag significantly behind network installation expenses until such network is substantially complete 
if the company is able to deploy additional networks  the losses created by this lag in revenues are expected to increase until the revenues from the installed networks overtake the costs associated with the deployment and operation of such additional networks 
accordingly  the company does not expect positive cash flow after capital expenditures from its nmr services operations for several years

substantial and increasing competition the emerging market for utility nmr systems  the deregulation of the electric utility industry and the potential market for other applications once a common infrastructure is in place  have led electronics  communications and utility product companies to begin developing various systems  some of which currently compete  and others of which may in the future compete  with the cellnet system 
deregulation will likely cause competition to increase 
the company believes that its only significant direct competitor in the marketplace at present is itron  inc itron  an established manufacturer and seller of hand held and drive by automated meter reading amr equipment for utilities 
itron is currently providing to customers its genesis tm system  a radio network system similar to the company s system  for meter reading purposes 
there may be many potential alternative solutions to the company s nmr services including traditional wireless solutions 
motorola is an example of a company whose technology might be adapted for nmr and who might become a competitor of the company 
mtel has announced that it intends to adapt its technology to offer residential services similar to nmr some time in over its existing paging network  with the development of endpoint cellnet radios and network management capabilities being left to other independent companies 
whisper communications formerly  a part of diablo research now offers its true way tm fixed based radio frequency rf architecture communications technology for automated meter reading and other services and has several trials underway 
metricom  a provider primarily of subscriber based  wireless data communications for users of portable and desktop computers  is currently involved in the amr market through trials with whisper communications 
schlumberger industries  inc schlumberger and greenland are among the companies that have conducted  or are in the process of conducting  pilot trials of utility network automation systems 
several companies are offering telephone based network automated meter reading services or equipment 
among these are international teldata and american innovations 
established suppliers of equipment  services and technology to the utility industry such as asea brown boveri and general electric could expand their current product and service offerings so as to compete directly with the company  although they have not yet done so 
many of the company s present and potential future competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and manufacturing resources  name recognition and experience than the company 
the company s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than the company 
while cellnet believes its technology  including its software  is widely regarded as competitive at the present time  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing products  technologies or software that are better or more cost effective 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
in addition  if the company achieves significant success it could draw additional competitors into the market 
traditional providers of wireless services may in the future choose to enter the company s markets 
such existing and future competition could materially adversely affect the pricing for the company s services and the company s ability to sign new services contracts and maintain existing agreements 
competition for services relating to non utility applications may be more intense than competition for nmr services  and additional competitors may emerge as the company continues to develop non utility applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow

technological performance and build out of the system  rapid technological change and uncertainty the company s initial target market is the monitoring  control and automation of utilities electric  gas and water meters and distribution networks 
there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not develop with respect to the company s technology  products or services  or that the company will be successful in completing the development and commercial implementation of its technology on a wider scale 
the company must continue to expand and upgrade its capabilities in connection with such commercial implementation  the success of which cannot be assured 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop successfully a full range of endpoint devices 
the company must also continue to develop the hardware enhancements necessary to utilize its system on a commercial basis with a variety of different electric  gas and water meters 
the company s future success will be materially adversely affected if it is not successful or is significantly delayed in continuing technology development and enhancement programs 
the company s future success will also depend  in part  on its ability to enhance its existing hardware  software and wireless communications technology 
the telecommunications industry has been characterized by rapid  significant technological advances 
the advent of computer linked electronic networks  fiber optic transmission  cellnet advanced data digitization technology  cellular and satellite communications capabilities and personal communications systems pcs have radically expanded communications capabilities and market opportunities 
future advances may render the company s technology obsolete or less cost effective than competitive systems or erode the company s market position 
many companies from diverse industries are seeking solutions for the transmission of data over traditional communications media  including radio and paging  as well as more recently developed media such as cellular and pcs based networks 
competitors may be capable of offering significant cost savings or other benefits to the company s customers  and there can be no assurance that the company will maintain competitive services or obtain appropriate new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms 
the company s future performance will also depend significantly on its ability to respond to future regulatory changes 
see business wireless communications industry overview 
the company s necessary development efforts will require it to make continued substantial investments 
the company has encountered product development delays in the past affecting both software and hardware components of its system

access to radio frequency rf spectrum  regulation by the federal communications commission fcc the company attempts to obtain exclusive usage of licensed bandwidth and or secure its own licenses 
the company has focused its spectrum acquisition strategy generally on the largest msas and cmsas in the united states 
as of december   the company had acquired spectrum licenses in the top msas cmsas 
however  sufficient frequency spectrum may not be available to fully enable the delivery of all or a part of the company s wireless data communications services or the company may be required to find alternative frequencies 
the cost of obtaining such spectrum is currently difficult to estimate and may involve time delays and or increased cost to the company 
the company could also be unable to obtain frequency in certain areas 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on the company s future ability to provide its network services and on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
see business spectrum regulation 
the company s network equipment uses radio spectrum and  as such  is subject to regulation by the fcc 
the company s network equipment uses both licensed rf spectrum allocated for multiple address system mas operations in the mhz band and unlicensed spectrum in the mhz band 
in order to obtain a license to operate the company s network equipment in the mhz band  license applicants may need to obtain a waiver of various sections of the fcc s rules 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such waivers on a timely basis or to obtain them at all 
in addition  as the amount of spectrum in the mhz band is limited  issuance of these licenses is contingent upon the availability of spectrum in the area s for which the licenses are requested 
the company might not be able to obtain licenses to the spectrum it needs in every area in which it has prospective customers 
the fcc s current rules  subject to a number of limited exceptions  permit third parties such as cellnet to operate on spectrum licensed to utilities to provide other services 
the company plans to use these provisions of the fcc s rules to expand its network system 
the fcc requires that a minimum configuration of an mas system be in operation within eighteen months from the initial date of the grant of the system authorization or risk forfeiture of the license for the mas frequencies 
the eighteen month deadline may be extended upon a showing of good cause  but there is no assurance that the fcc will grant any such extension 
the company is responding to this requirement by selectively building out transmission capacity in some areas where it does not yet have utility telecommunications services contracts and may return licenses to the fcc in certain areas 
cellnet no license is needed to operate the company s equipment utilizing the mhz band  although the equipment must be certified by the company and the fcc as being compliant with certain fcc restrictions on radio frequency emissions designed to protect licensed services from objectionable interference 
while the company believes it has obtained all required certifications for its products  the fcc could modify the limits imposed on such products or otherwise impose new authorization requirements  and in either case  such changes could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
the fcc recently completed a rulemaking proceeding designed to better accommodate the cohabitation in the mhz band of existing licensed services with newly authorized and expanded uses of licensed systems  and existing and newly designed unlicensed devices like those used by the company 
in this proceeding  the fcc expressly recognized the rights of such unlicensed services to operate under certain delineated operating parameters even if the potential for interference to the licensed operations exists 
the company s systems will operate within those specified parameters 
the fcc is currently reviewing these rules in response to numerous petitions for reconsideration and the agency could modify those rules or allow for other uses of this spectrum that might create interference to the company s systems  which could  in either case  have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
while the company intends to offer alternate market services over its private  internal network  some of those services may include the use of the company s network for private carrier service offerings 
the company s offerings would be structured to comply with fcc rules governing the offering of private carrier services  and each such service offering would need to be reviewed relative to these rules 
the fcc s rules currently prohibit the use of the mas frequencies on which the company is operating its systems for the provision of common carrier service offerings 
in the event that it is determined that a particular service offering does not comply with the rules  the company may be required to restructure such offering or to utilize other frequencies for the purpose of providing such service 
there can be no assurances that the company will gain access to such other frequencies 
future interpretation of regulations by the fcc or changes in the regulation of the company s industry by the fcc or other regulatory bodies or legislation by congress could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
see business spectrum regulation 
in february  the fcc published for public comment a notice of proposed rule making in wt docket no 
regarding the future licensing of frequencies for use by multiple address systems 
the fcc has reached certain tentative conclusions which  if adopted without any change  would result in i the restriction on future licenses in the mhz band in which the company now operates its wide area network for systems exclusively used for private internal purposes  and the prohibition on future licensing in this band for systems which provide subscriber based services  ii the designation of the and mhz bands for licensees offering subscriber based services  iii the use of geographic licensing using very large licensed service areas in lieu of site by site licensing for the bands designated for subscriber based services  iv the use of competitive bidding to award licenses for subscriber based services  v the grandfathering and protection from interference of existing licensees  but only to the extent of their current service areas  vi with respect to new geographic service area licensees  liberalizing the time periods by which construction must be completed  but imposing more burdensome construction requirements over the term of the license  and vii for incumbent and new licensees  liberalizing some of the technical and operational restrictions on the use of the licensed channels 
these proposals have engendered substantial public comment from a wide range of industry sectors currently utilizing the mas channels  including extensive comments from the company 
the company has urged  in particular  that there should not be any restrictions imposed on the use of the mhz bands in which the company has developed its network facilities that would unreasonably limit the company s ability to provide its cellnet current and anticipated utility and non utility service offerings 
the company has also urged that competitive bidding and geographic licensing should not be the primary basis for awarding licenses in this highly encumbered  heavily utilized band 
the company has also supported many of the proposed changes that will make the use of the band more technically efficient  although the company has also opposed any use of the band that would change its fundamental use for point to multipoint fixed operations  and in particular  the use of the band for mobile operations 
the company s positions have substantial support in the record  although the effort to retain the status quo eligibility for the mhz band has been opposed by representatives of the utility and transportation industries who would prefer to limit the use of this band solely to private internal networks and to prohibit any private carrier or subscriber based service offerings 
the company is currently working with a coalition of interested parties  including representatives of the utility and transportation industries  to attempt to develop a compromise consensus proposal that would satisfy most of the interested parties concerns for presentation to the fcc in this proceeding 
however  the company is unable to predict whether such a compromise can be developed  or if it is developed  whether the fcc will view it favorably  and if not  what form the final rules adopted in this proceeding will take 
given the current proposal and the variety of comments submitted  it is possible that some or all of the company s uses of the mas channels could be determined to be the offering of private carrier or subscriber based services  and that future licenses for such offerings would be prohibited in the mhz band in which the company currently operates  requiring the company to develop equipment capable of operating in one of the other mas bands  and further requiring the company to obtain future licenses in a competitive bidding process 
although the company believes that additional licensed frequency will be generally available to it as required  the cost associated with acquiring such licensed frequency as well as the company s operating costs could increase  perhaps substantially  and the company could experience substantial delays in adapting its networks if the proposed rules were adopted 
the adoption of new rules  depending upon the form in which such rules are adopted  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
in connection with the foregoing  the fcc has temporarily suspended acceptance of mas applications for new licenses  major amendments  or major modifications for the mhz bands and applications to provide subscriber based services in the mhz bands 
this temporary suspension does not affect applications for mas licenses for private internal purposes in the mhz bands or applications for assignment of licenses or transfer of control 
subject to certain limitations  pending applications at the time of the suspension will continue to be processed 
all of the company s pending applications for licenses in the mhz band have been or are being processed in due course 
in addition  the company s applications for the assignment of licenses held by others have been processed during the processing suspension 
however  the fcc has tentatively concluded that the company s applications for licenses involve the offering of subscriber based services  and have therefore returned any applications newly filed after the initiation of the processing suspension  precluding the company from obtaining any new licenses other than through the assignment process while the processing suspension is in place 
the company has requested reconsideration of this determination since the currently proposed uses of these licenses constitutes  in the company s view  a private  internal use network 
if the fcc does not change its tentative conclusion on this matter  the company will not be able to file any applications for new facilities until the suspension is lifted  which is expected to occur when the proceedings in docket are concluded 
this may adversely affect the company s ability to service areas where it has not yet acquired adequate frequencies 
risks associated with international expansion the company is pursuing international markets through bcn  its international joint venture with ben 
the company has incurred  and anticipates that it will continue to incur  significant and increasing expenses in connection with cellnet the establishment of international operations 
if revenues generated by international activities are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these activities  the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
international demand for the company s services and systems may not materialize  and where present  is likely to vary by country  based on such factors as the regulatory environment  electric power generating capacity and demand  labor costs  costs of spectrum acquisition and other political and economic conditions 
in addition  the company may confront significant challenges in developing and implementing localized versions of its nmr system due to many factors including the differing standards among utilities on a country by country basis 
to date  the company has limited experience in developing a localized version of its wireless data communications system for foreign markets 
the company believes its ability to establish business alliances in each international market will be critical to its success 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop  market and implement its system in international markets or establish successful business alliances for these markets 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely impact the company s potential international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on its business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
see business pursue international expansion 
the company s strategy of pursuing international markets through bcn may involve additional partners in local operating project entities in particular countries 
the company or bcn may not have a majority interest or control of the board of directors of any such local operating project entity 
in any such joint venture in which the company or bcn may determine to participate  there is a risk that the other joint venture partner may at any time have economic  business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or the company or bcn or that such partner will not impose the same or similar accounting and financial controls as the company or bcn 
the risk is also present that a joint venture partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations and that the company or bcn may be required to fulfill those obligations 
in addition  in any joint venture in which the company or bcn does not have a majority interest  the company or bcn may not have control over the operations or assets of such joint venture 
furthermore  the joint venture structure may limit the amount of funds that can be upstreamed to the company or bcn

management of growth  dependence on key personnel the company s recent growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on its managerial  operational and financial resources 
the company s ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand and manage its employee base 
these demands are expected to require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  that its systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that company management will be able to exploit opportunities for the company s services 
an inability to manage growth  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
the success of the company is substantially dependent on its key management and technical personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could adversely affect the company s business 
substantially all of the company s employees and officers are employed on an at will basis 
presently  the company does not maintain a key man cellnet life insurance policy on any of its executives or employees 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
an inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
uncertainty of protection of copyrights  patents and proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of trade secret protection  copyright  patent  trademark and confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to maintain copyright and patent protection for its products  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
while the company has obtained and applied for patents  and intends to file applications as appropriate for patents covering its products and processes  there can be no assurance that additional patents will be issued or  if issued  that the scope of any patent protection will be significant  or that any patents issued to the company or licensed by the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection to the company 
since united states patent applications are maintained in secrecy until patents are issued  and since publication of inventions in the technical or patent literature tend to lag behind such inventions by several months  cellnet cannot be certain that it was the first creator of inventions covered by its issued patents or pending patent applications  that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions or that no patent conflict will exist with other products or processes which could compete with the company s products or approach 
despite the company s efforts to safeguard and maintain these proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful or that the company s competitors will not independently develop and patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
participants in the wireless industry  including competitors of the company  typically seek to obtain patents which will provide as broad a protection as possible for their products and processes 
there is a substantial backlog of patents pending at the united states patent and trademark office 
it is uncertain whether any such third party patents will require the company to alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
an adverse outcome with regard to a third party patent infringement claim could subject the company to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed or restrict the company s ability to use such technology 
the company also relies to a substantial degree upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others  including the company s competitors  will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets 
in addition  whether or not additional patents are issued to the company  others may receive patents which contain claims applicable to products or processes developed by the company 
if any such claims were to be upheld  the company would require licenses  and no assurance can be given that licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the company could incur substantial costs in defending against suits brought against it by others for infringement of intellectual property rights or in prosecuting suits which the company might bring against other parties to protect its intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company receives inquiries with respect to the coverage of its intellectual property rights  and there can be no assurance that such inquiries will not develop into litigation

dependence on third party manufacturers  exposure to component shortages the company relies and will continue to rely on outside parties to manufacture a majority of its network equipment such as radio devices and printed circuit boards 
as the company signs additional services contracts  there will be a significant ramp up in the amount of manufacturing by third parties in order to enable the company to meet its contractual commitments 
there can be no assurance that these manufacturers will be able to meet the company s manufacturing needs in a satisfactory and timely manner or that the company can obtain additional manufacturers when and if needed 
although the company believes alternative manufacturers are available  an inability of the company to develop alternative suppliers quickly or cost effectively could materially impair its ability to manufacture and install systems 
the company s reliance on third party manufacturers involves a number of additional risks  including the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  production yields and costs 
although the company believes that these manufacturers would have an economic incentive to perform such manufacturing for the company  the quality  amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities is not within the control of the company  and there can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not occur in the future

a significant number of new electric meters are required to initiate meter retrofit and replacement in connection with each network deployment and to replace existing meters in the field which are found to be obsolete  worn out or otherwise unsuitable for retrofit and redeployment 
any sudden or material increase in the number of deployments would result in an increase in the number of new electric meters ordered by electric utilities and new power market participants over and above those ordered on account of normal growth and replacement within their service areas 
to the extent that electric meter manufacturers are unable or unwilling to increase production in line with such increase in demand  temporarily or over a longer term  deployments may be delayed or postponed  with the result that revenues from such deployments will be likewise delayed or postponed 
cellnet possible termination of contracts the company expects that a substantial portion of its future revenues will be provided pursuant to services contracts of various kinds 
these contracts will generally be subject to cancellation or termination in certain circumstances in the event of a material and continuing failure on cellnet s part to meet agreed nmr performance standards on a consistent basis over agreed time periods  subject to certain rights to cure any such failure 
each of the company s existing utility services contracts provides for termination of such contracts by the respective utility without cause in less than ten years  subject to certain reimbursement provisions 
such contracts also provide that cellnet will be required to compensate such utilities for the use of its system for non utility applications 
future services contracts with utilities and new power market participants may contain similar provisions 
in the event that such a services contract is terminated  the company would almost certainly incur substantial losses 
in addition  the company anticipates that any contracts with new power market participants will have shorter terms than the company s existing utility contracts 
a network s service revenues are not expected to exceed the company s capital investments to deploy such network for several years
