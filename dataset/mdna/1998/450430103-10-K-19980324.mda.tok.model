except with respect to funding any future acquisitions  management believes that funds available under its credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet iteq s anticipated cash requirements for management further believes that iteq could obtain additional capital to make acquisitions primarily through either issuances of common or preferred stock  or debt or lease financing  although no assurance can be given with respect to whether such financing would be available when required or whether such financing can be obtained on terms acceptable to iteq 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its computer software programs and operating systems to ensure such programs and systems will be able to process transactions in the year however  the company does not expect that such costs to modify its programs and systems will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not currently have information concerning the year compliance of its suppliers and customers 
in the event the company s significant suppliers or customers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s operations could be adversely affected
