in november  the company redeemed all of its outstanding convertible debentures due  which aggregated  in principal amount  incurring an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt of  funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a relevant supplemental measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and certain amortization expenses as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real property 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
in  ffo increased  to  as compared to  in the increase was net of several effects  but was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues from core portfolio properties  acquisitions  and developments 
in  ffo increased  to  from  in if the one time charges in were excluded  the company would have reported a decrease in ffo in of  this decrease was net of several effects  but was primarily attributable to the expiration of the mcdonnell douglas lease and the subsequent sale of the building in june of  the sale of the beverly garland hotel in december of  lower rents received on the anacomp building following the renegotiation of the anacomp lease during the first quarter of  and higher expenses related to the opening of regional offices in los angeles and san francisco 
ffo as presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the company s calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands net income loss    adjustments gain on sales of real estate    impairments writedowns of assets  depreciation of real estate and tenant improvements    amortization of leasing costs early extinguishment of debt funds from operations    liquidity and capital resources the company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all payments on notes payable  recurring tenant improvements  and dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements through the end of however  the company will require additional sources of capital to finance the acquisition and development of additional properties 
sources of this additional capital may include cash on hand  borrowings under credit facilities and mortgage indebtedness  proceeds from sales of non strategic assets  the sale of interests in certain properties to third parties  the issuance of operating partnership units to sellers of properties and  to the extent market conditions permit  the issuance of debt or equity securities 
however  there can be no assurances that capital necessary to finance future acquisitions and developments will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
cash flow from operating activities for increased to  as compared to  in the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions and developments completed in and and new leasing of the core portfolio properties

the series a preferred stock has a cumulative dividend yield of and is convertible into common stock in increments between the first and second anniversaries of the date of issuance at a conversion price per share initially equal to  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
at the same time  the company issued  series a preferred limited partner units the preferred units of the operating partnership to blackacre capital group  lp and highridge partners representing  of the initial consideration for the acquisition of the golden state properties portfolio 
the preferred units were issued on terms comparable to the company s series a preferred stock and  after the passage of time and the satisfaction of other conditions  are exchangeable on a for basis for shares of series a preferred stock 
although the acquisition of the golden state properties portfolio and the issuance of the series a preferred stock and the preferred units collectively preferred securities did not require approval by the company s stockholders  the issuance upon the exchange or conversion of preferred securities of a number of shares of common stock equal to or exceeding of the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the time of the acquisition does require such approval pursuant to nyse regulations

to at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company s total debt consisted of  of fixed rate debt  and  of variable rate debt

at december   the company had effective shelf registration statements on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to an aggregate of  registered and unissued debt and equity securities 
year issues in the operation of its business the company uses commercial computer software primarily purchased from or provided by independent software vendors 
after an analysis of the company s exposure to the impact of year issues ie issues that may arise resulting from computer programs that use only the last two  rather than all four  digits of the year  management has determined that such commercial software is already substantially year compliant  and that completion of year compliance should not have a material impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition 
management is not in a position to evaluate the extent if any to which any year issues that may affect the economy generally  or any tenants  suppliers or others with whom the company does business  in particular would also be likely to affect the company 
effects of inflation substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in these operating expenses resulting from inflation to the extent that its properties are occupied 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and may  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans
