item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following summarizes the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the information below and elsewhere in this form k may contain certain forward looking statements that have been based on imprecise assumptions with regard to production levels  price realizations  and expenditures for exploration and development and anticipated results therefrom 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed herein or implied by such statements 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal was the best year in the company s history but this was not readily evident 
this was primarily due to substantial exploration and impairment charges which significantly reduced net earnings and overshadowed the boost in natural gas production to record levels 
these charges totaled  which  after being tax effected  reduced net earnings by  or per share and resulted in earnings of  or per share  which were higher than last year s net of  or per share 
discretionary cash flow set a record at  in surpassing s prior record of  by 
gross revenues and oil and gas sales both set historical records also 
as of the end of  shareholders equity had risen to  compared to  at november  positive working capital of  at year end  combined with the company s anticipated cash flow for  should be a sufficient source of capital to develop undeveloped reserves and fund a exploration program 
as discussed later  a substantial increase in the percentage working interest ownership in the louisiana austin chalk exploratory well required s million capital budget to be raised by over million and after the overruns million extra was spent 
this required a short term draw from the company s bank credit facility until additional monthly cash flow could restore the amount to  which had been outstanding at the beginning of the year 
the  credit facility has been primarily targeted by management for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  but can be used for any legal corporate purpose and is always available for such expanded operational expenditures 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require cash flows from operating activities to be determined after giving effect to working capital changes 
accordingly  gaap s net cash provided from operating activities has fluctuated widely from  to  during the last three years 
this source of funds  with a backup from the available borrowing base under the company s credit facility  has provided all of the liquidity required to finance those three years oil and gas capital expenditures as well as fund treasury stock repurchases 
however  an important alternative measure of a company s cash flow not gaap but commonly used in the industry is one determined before consideration of either working capital changes or deduction of exploration expenses and is generally known as discretionary cash flow dcf 
this is reported by successful efforts companies for comparability purposes to the cash flow results of a majority of independent energy companies who use the full cost accounting method 
with the latter accounting method  all exploration costs are capitalized  and consequently  do not adversely affect either operating cash flow or net earnings 
since exploration expenses can be increased or decreased at management s discretion  dcf is the most comparable to their full cost accounting results 
columbus dcf for was an all time record at  and compares to s  which itself had been the prior record 
this improvement directly reflects higher natural gas prices and increased crude oil and natural gas production over while dcf is calculated before any debt retirement requirements  in columbus case it does not matter because its outstanding bank debt requires no principal payments before august  interest expense on outstanding debt has recently been fairly insignificant but is deducted before computing dcf 
management continues to note its strong exception to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
which directs that operating cash flow must only be determined after consideration of working capital changes 
we continue to reflect that position in all public filings and reports based on our belief such a requirement by gaap ignores entirely the significant impact on working capital that the timing of income received for  and expenses incurred on behalf of  third party owners in wells has on a company which serves as an operator of properties with only a small working interest therein as in columbus case 
nevertheless  neither discretionary cash flow nor operating cash flow before working capital changes may be substituted for net income or cash available from operations as defined by gaap 
furthermore  current cash flows do not necessarily indicate that there will be sufficient funds for future cash requirements under any of the definitions of cash flow 
at the present time the company has not hedged either crude oil or natural gas prices similar to the swaps in prior years discussed below 
as a result the company s oil and gas revenues are fully exposed to risk of declining prices  as has occurred during first quarter but  in turn  can fully benefit from any price increases  if any  later in in prior years columbus has hedged both natural gas and crude oil prices by selling a swap 
the swap is matched against the calendar monthly average price on the nymex and settled monthly 
revenues are decreased when the market price at settlement exceeded the contract swap price or increased when the contract swap price exceeded the market price 
the following table shows the results of these swaps increase decrease in oil and gas revenues volume description per mo 
period mmbtu or bbl natural gas mmbtu   futures contracts   mmbtu   mmbtu   crude oil bbl    bbl with bbl cap    the company s natural gas and crude oil swaps were considered financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which were in the normal course of business to partially reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
those instruments involved  to varying degrees  elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the company had no natural gas or crude oil swaps outstanding as of november  columbus had outstanding borrowings of  as of november  against its line of credit with norwest bank denver  na which has a borrowing base of  and is collateralized by oil and gas properties 
at the end of  the ratio of bank debt to shareholders equity was and to total assets was 
the debt outstanding used a libor option with an average interest rate of 
subsequent to year end through january   the debt was increased by  to  as payments were made for late fiscal and early fiscal drilling activity 
the net increase or decrease in long term debt directly affects cash flows from financing activities 
this cash flow item also reflects the purchase of treasury stock discussed below and benefits from the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
working capital at year end remained positive at  compared to  at november  this was achieved despite record capital expenditures of  for new additions to oil and gas properties as well as the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for  during the year 
the change in working capital also reflected a  reduction in current deferred income taxes during the year 
the company has been authorized by the board of directors to repurchase its common shares from the market at various prices during the last several years 
those repurchases are summarized as follows shares fiscal year average repurchased as purchased restated price restated for stock split and stock dividends as of november  a total of  shares remained out of the most recent authorization which may be repurchased at a price not to exceed per share 
as of january    of those shares have been acquired at an average price of per share 
during  capital expenditures were incurred on oil and gas properties which totaled  this amount differs from the capital expenditure shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows which includes cash payments made during for expenditures incurred but not yet paid as of s year end 
similarly  there have been expenditures accrued in that will not be actually paid until these were primarily for the expanded exploratory program in the louisiana austin chalk and montana areas along with development drilling and recompletions in the south texas and gulf coast areas 
the cash flows from investing activities had an unusual benefit in from the  net proceeds received from the divestiture of resources 
results of operations the company s gross revenues of million were above s and was attributable to a record level of natural gas production plus improved crude oil production generated by the company s drilling program during it should be obvious that revenues and expenses were not entirely comparable to s because of the aforementioned divestiture of the canadian subsidiary toward the end of the first quarter of total company revenues did increase by in but  if canadian operations were excluded from  the company s revenues would have increased by 
higher crude oil and natural gas prices and production were responsible for the improvement 
operating income of  in represented an improvement of only when compared with because of the aforementioned exploratory charges and impairment provisions or otherwise that increase would have been 
operating income of  in reflected improved revenues but was not comparable to which showed a loss of  a direct result of deduction of impairment losses which are fully discussed below 
the operating loss in also resulted from lower revenues and higher depletion expense following the canadian divestiture 
net earnings during set a new high for us only operations of  which surpassed s earnings of  had there not been the extremely high non cash impairment provisions during  all time record net earnings would have resulted which would have surpassed those years which included canada s operations 
contrarily  earnings in  even ignoring the impairment charge  were at their lowest level since impairments a non cash impairment loss of  for and  for recognized that some marginal oklahoma development oil wells completed during those years effectively reduced future net revenues for this successful efforts property pool below undepreciated costs 
similarly  the louisiana austin chalk oil discovery  although successful see full discussion about this area under recent activities in item  properties  brought into question the likelihood of future development of certain leaseholds 
where annual renewal rentals either had already become due or would become due before a reasonable production test period for the morrow h is achieved and or a new test well promoted  management chose to write them off as impaired 
also included were numerous small leaseholds where the possibility of easily putting together a unit was rather remote 
this added charge of  brought the total non cash impairment provision made during the third quarter to  late in the fourth quarter  the morrow h did commence production at rates well below the initial tests so year end proved reserves attributable to the horizontal legs were reduced 
this resulted in carrying costs in excess of the fair value and in an impairment charge of  and  related to louisiana leaseholds 
undeveloped leaseholds in general were also impaired in the amount of  based upon management s opinion further development may not be completed prior to some lease expirations 
two oil wells in oklahoma in progress at the end of the third quarter failed to respond to attempts to eliminate shifting frac sands from plugging perforations so an additional impairment of  was provided 
the company elected to adopt early statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of sfas requires that an impairment loss be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flow of the asset 
the company had to provide for impairment of oil and gas properties based on expected prices and year end proved reserves both of which would be significantly reduced 
four areas in texas  oklahoma  new mexico and north dakota showed that impairment losses were greater than previously anticipated so it was deemed prudent to elect early adoption 
accordingly  a non cash loss of   after tax was recognized as of september  prior to september   a valuation provision had only been made if total capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  excluding unproved properties  by country  exceeded the present value of future net revenues from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using constant prices discounted at less income tax effects related to differences between book and tax basis of the properties 
therefore  no impairment had been necessary prior to adopting sfas because total capitalized costs in the us were far less than discounted future net revenues 
interestingly  had columbus followed the full cost method no impairments of oil and gas property costs excluding the impairment of undeveloped leases would have been necessary as the total value of proved reserves of the company have comfortably exceeded such capitalized full cost method costs 
oil and gas operations the following discussion of the company s oil and gas operations is based upon the tables of production and average prices shown separately for the united states and canada 
see item  oil and gas properties and production 
the changes in the components of oil and gas revenues during the periods presented are summarized as follows production price change quantity change revenue change vs 
all us gas oil vs 
gas us gas canada total company gas oil us oil canada total company oil natural gas revenues increased when compared to as a result of higher volumes and prices 
average prices for natural gas increased in compared with last year due to strong demand and a fairly tight supply of gas in excess of storage injection requirements 
gas revenues in were reduced by  
per mcf and s revenues were reduced by  
per mcf from swaps of natural gas 
sales volumes improved by over as a result of numerous gas wells being completed and connected in texas during the past year 
oil revenues for managed improvement over as a result of a sales volume and average price increase of each 
crude oil production reversed its continuing slide over a several year period as new wells were added in which generated the improvement over the prior year s volumes 
new oil and condensate production in montana and chambers county  texas during was mostly offset by reductions in harris county  texas and north dakota and by properties that were sold in late oil revenues for were decreased by  
per barrel while revenues were reduced by  per barrel from crude oil swaps 
columbus average sales volumes of natural gas of  mcfd and oil and liquids production of barrels per day equates to daily production of  barrels of oil equivalent boe 
this surpassed the previous record for us daily production of  boe achieved during the third quarter of and the fourth quarter production averaged  boe per day 
the next challenge is to not only maintain but to increase that level of production by adding substantial new reserves from an expanded exploratory budget hopefully without expensive failures or high cost successes such as the morrow h in louisiana 
after the increase in natural gas production during with an increase of only in oil production  the company now produces approximately of its volumes from natural gas 
this may be very fortuitous as the price of crude oil in early rapidly declined 
natural gas revenues for compared to in the us increased despite reductions from swaps as a result of a higher price and a increase in production 
average prices improved because of increased demand and severely depleted storage levels following an extended winter heating season 
natural gas revenues for were reduced by  
per mcf from swaps of natural gas while had increased revenues of  
per mcf 
production volumes for increased as a result of property acquisitions and the effects of newly developed wells 
oil revenues in the us for were up from as a result of a increase in the average price received and higher volumes 
oil revenues and average prices for were reduced by  per barrel due to hedging activity 
the company had no oil hedges in crude oil production improved because of two new jackson sand oil well completions in the sralla road field plus a third discovery wi gas condensate well almost one mile southwest which commenced production in november these increases overcame normal production declines elsewhere 
natural gas revenues and production for decreased compared to primarily as a result of lower prices  lower gas production in the sralla road field  and a reversionary interest in the company s most productive gas well in the laredo area which accounted for about one half of the reduced gas production 
these deductions more than offset additional well connections in texas and oklahoma  average prices for natural gas decreased compared to but did begin to increase toward the end of fiscal oil revenues for the us for were up from as a result of a increase in the average price received 
in low crude oil prices dictated continued deferral of any revival of an oil development program of undeveloped oil reserves located in the williston basin 
however  a moderate amount of drilling was planned for as a result of putting the oil swap in place which afforded some protection from previous drastic downturns in prices which each time halted drilling plans before anything could get underway 
us oil prices have fluctuated for several years with the same wide swings experienced in world crude oil price 
in crude oil prices declined during mid year months but recovered by year end so that the average annual prices were actually higher than by the spring of crude oil prices rose quickly to above per barrel  declined briefly  then again rose rapidly to almost per barrel by year end 
during crude oil prices have been steadily softening and have declined each quarter which trend accelerated in the first quarter of fiscal fluctuations of oil and gas revenues and operations in canada which appear in the table are consistent with the spin off of resources in february  ie vs 
revenues decreased which reflects the fact included the last quarter of canadian activity 
lease operating expenses for were lower than despite more wells in operation because the prior year had several expensive workovers performed and production equipment was replaced on several older wells 
lease operating expenses in the us increased in over s because of incremental working interest acquisitions and several extensive work overs performed in an effort to make some wells more economic 
lease operating costs on a barrel of oil equivalent basis for were down to compared to in and for lease operating expenses in the us increased in compared to because of a few expensive work overs 
lease operating costs on a barrel of oil equivalent basis for were up to compared to for operating costs in the us as a percentage of revenues decreased to in versus in due to increasing unit prices and compared with in production and property taxes approximated of revenues in and of revenues in and these vary based on texas percentage share of the total production where oil tax rates are lower than gas tax rates 
the relationship of taxes and revenue is not always directly proportional since several of the local jurisdiction s property taxes are based upon reserve evaluations as opposed to revenues received or production rates for a given tax period 
operating and management services this segment of the company s us business is comprised of operations and services conducted on behalf of third parties and includes compressor rentals 
during operating and management services profit was  compared to a  profit for as the number of operated wells and drilling activity increased 
prior to the company s divestiture of resources in  the company received significant operating service revenue from its share of processing fees at the carbon area liquid extraction plant 
those revenues also included fees from the processing of resources own gas  although no profit was generated from that portion of revenues since it was offset by a commensurate increase in columbus well operating expenses 
operating and management services us revenue has increased in each of the last three years 
until divested in  canadian operations had contributed far greater operating margins than the us but us revenues in improved because of additional billings for operator services related to d seismic testing program and past audit adjustments 
these factors generated a  profit for the us segment in that year 
interest income interest income is earned primarily from short term investments whose rates fluctuate with changes in the commercial paper rates and the prime rate 
interest income increased slightly in to  as a result of higher short term interest rates achieved and despite a decreased amount of investments 
interest income decreased in to  when compared to  in  reflecting a decreased amount of investments and lower short term interest rates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are considered to be those which relate to the direct costs of the company which do not originate from operation of properties or providing of services 
corporate expense represents a major part of this category although other nonbillable expenses are included 
the company s general and administrative expenses in were much higher than the prior year due to salary increases in may for officers and in november for employees and to incentive bonuses 
the latter were discretionary and were actually based on the company s performance in with total bonuses of   non cash in compared to  all non cash in a major source of this increase was also attributable to legal and accounting expenses which had been accrued in connection with preparation of a registration statement for a proposed offering of convertible preferred shares which was withdrawn because of the rapid paydown of debt in latter from accelerating cash flow 
during the company upgraded its computer software to a new release of a major software vendor that is compliant with the year and expensed  which is included in general and administrative expenses 
the company does not expect to incur any other significant amounts in the future in connection with the year problem 
the company s expenses for were lower than for all of because of salary and staff reductions which occurred in august affected the whole year 
also  incentive bonuses all non cash totaled only  in compared to  granted in may  reimbursement for services provided by columbus officers and employees for managing resources is expected to decrease in assuming that canadian based management takes over following an expected business combination that resources is currently aggressively seeking 
columbus general and administrative expense will rise commensurately when resources merger occurs since no staff reductions are contemplated when this occurs 
reimbursement of  was realized in compared to  in and  for all of fiscal year for providing services to resources 
the company s us only expenses for were higher than s because employee salary and staff reductions were offset by higher compensation from cashless stock option exercises  increased fees associated with a regular listing on the amex  shareholder and stock transfer expense  professional services which included the fees of a second petroleum engineering firm and a higher matching percentage contribution to the company s k plan 
overall  the total of general and administrative expenses declined in compared to due to the spin off of resources 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets are calculated based upon the units of production compared to proved reserves of each field 
the expense is not only directly related to the level of production  but also is dependent upon past costs to find  develop and recover those reserves in each of the pools or fields 
depreciation and amortization of office equipment and computer software is also included in the total charge 
total charges for depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased in over due to increased production and added development expenditures in the intervening period 
total charges for depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased in over due to greater production despite the benefit realized from the write down of the carrying value of certain properties upon adoption of sfas during depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased by a greater percentage than the increase in production 
contributing to the disproportionately higher depletion expense were much lower gas and crude oil prices during  which tended to reduce reserves  shorten the estimated reserve life and change the economic limits of certain of the company s properties 
the lower carrying values of certain oil and gas properties after the impairment loss with the adoption of sfas effective september  helped to reduce depletion expense for the fourth quarter of for  the depletion and depreciation rate for the company was per barrel of oil equivalent boe compared to per boe for fiscal and per boe equivalent in however  had the benefit of the lower depletion costs of canadian gas properties not been included for one quarter  the higher cost us additions would have raised the charge to per boe 
effective october  the company sold its interests in seven wells in the berry cox field in texas for total proceeds of  these wells were a part of a larger pool of properties in the laredo area for purposes of calculating depletion so those sale proceeds were credited to the costs of the successful efforts pool and no book gain or loss was recognized 
the reduction in proved reserves connected with the sale could cause a small increase in that pool s depletion rate in future periods 
exploration expense in general  the exploration expense category includes the cost of company wide efforts to acquire and explore new prospective areas 
until resources was divested in february  the company s exploration expense was primarily attributable to geological consulting work provided in canada plus limited seismic expense in canada and the us the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties requires expensing the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
other exploratory charges such as d and d seismic and geological costs must be immediately expensed regardless of whether a prospect is ultimately proved to be successful 
exploration charges for were up dramatically to  from  in these included  of d seismic costs incurred in the se froid area in montana which located new exploratory well sites   incurred for a non commercial exploratory oil well along with ongoing exploration efforts 
subsequent to fiscal year end  a dry exploratory well was drilled in the se froid area in montana so approximately  will be recorded as an exploration expense during first quarter during two oklahoma exploratory wells drilled proved non economic and  was expensed 
most of the balance of the expense was for geological consulting 
during  seismic survey costs of  were incurred in canada and expensed while undeveloped leasehold costs in north dakota were impaired by  both of which contributed to an exploration expense of  all exploration expenses reduce reported gaap cash flow from operations even though they are discretionary expenses  however  such charges are added back for purposes of determining dcf which makes it more comparable to the cash flow results reported by full cost accounting companies 
retirement and separation expense during a total of  separation expense was paid to employees whose positions were eliminated and a total of  was accrued for retirement compensation for past years service for two employees who reached age and were approved by the board of directors to receive such compensation 
litigation expense the litigation expenses in and related to two lawsuits previously discussed in detail in prior annual reports 
the first  michael mattalino  bruce l 
davis and maris e 
penn vs 
columbus energy corp 
filed on april  was settled by agreement in september the second  porter farrell ii vs 
columbus energy corp 
filed october  had columbus motion for summary judgment granted on april  and the lawsuit was dismissed 
interest expense interest expense varies in a direct proportion to the amount of bank debt and the level of bank interest rates 
the average bank interest rate paid for us debt in  and was   and  respectively 
income taxes the company s income tax position is somewhat complex 
resources income was consolidated with the company s us income until columbus divestiture of resources in also  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by the company has been complicated by two change of ownership transactions under section of the internal revenue code  one of which occurred on october  and the other on august  only the first of those changes has limited the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  a quasi reorganization occurred on december  which requires that benefits from net operating loss carryforwards or any other tax credits that arose prior to the quasi reorganization be credited to additional paid in capital rather than to income 
only post quasi reorganization tax benefits realized can be credited to income 
as a result of available net operating loss carryforwards  the company s federal income tax obligations have been limited to alternative minimum tax so that the company has had a current federal tax payable of less than of pre tax earnings 
in  the company has a net operating loss carryforward from and operating loss carryforwards remaining from periods prior to the first section ownership change 
utilization of those latter benefits are limited to  per year so that the company s current federal tax provision and liability may increase in and thereafter unless an active drilling program is maintained 
in addition  the company pays state income taxes and previously  until its divestiture  also included canadian taxes on resources income 
during  the us net deferred tax asset was reduced to  which is comprised of a  current deferred tax asset and a  long term tax liability 
the deferred tax asset increased by an estimated  during the valuation allowance was increased by a net  even after canadian deferred taxes were reduced by  since such a provision was no longer required following the divestiture 
the estimated effective tax rate for was a book benefit 
during  the net deferred tax asset was reduced to  which is comprised of  current deferred tax asset and  long term liability 
the valuation allowance had a net reduction of  from to november  a deduction of  for the benefit of disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options was added to additional paid in capital 
during  there was a net deferred tax liability of  which is comprised of  current portion and  long term liability 
the valuation allowance had a net reduction of  from to november  a deduction of  for the benefit of disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options was added to additional paid in capital 
effects of changing prices the united states economy experienced considerable inflation during the late s and early s but in recent years has been fairly stable and at low levels 
the company  along with most other us business enterprises  was then and would be affected by any recurrence of such economic conditions 
inflation in general has had a minimal effect on the company 
in recent years  oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated widely so the company s results of operations and cash flow have been directly affected 
oil and gas prices have also been significantly influenced by regulation by various governmental agencies  by the world economy  and by world politics 
operating expenses have been relatively stable but  when analyzed as a percentage of revenues  may be distorted because they become a larger percentage of revenues when lower product prices prevail 
drilling and equipment costs have risen noticeably in the last two years 
competition in the industry can significantly affect the cost of acquiring leases  although in the past decade competition has lessened as more operators have withdrawn from active exploration programs 
inflation  as well as a recessionary period  can cause significant swings in the interest rates the company pays on bank borrowings 
these factors are anticipated to continue to affect the company s operations  both positively and negatively  for the foreseeable future
