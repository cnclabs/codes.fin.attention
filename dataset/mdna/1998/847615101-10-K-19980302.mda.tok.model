impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and determined that it will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter

however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
