item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in october to develop software to enable businesses to improve their customer service 
the company was engaged principally in research and development from inception through december  the company s suite of products addresses the front office automation market and is called the vantive enterprise 
the vantive enterprise consists of the following applications vantive sales  vantive support  vantive fieldservice  vantive inventory  vantive procurement  vantive helpdesk and vantive quality 
the release of vantive enterprise in the third quarter of contains significant enhancements to all applications and a new development environment  vantive object studio  which allows for rapid customization  deployment and administration of the vantive enterprise 
license fees for the company s software products consist of i a per server fee based on the specific vantive enterprise application s licensed and ii a fee based on the maximum number of concurrent  named or mobile users allowed to access those applications 
most of the company s revenues to date have resulted from non recurring license fees based on sales of concurrent user licenses 
the remaining revenues are primarily attributable to service revenues  which include customer support  consulting and training revenue 
of these service revenues  only customer support revenues are expected to be recurring 
customer support revenues accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
because concurrent user fees are not application specific  the company cannot precisely determine the breakdown of revenues attributable to specific applications for customers that have purchased more than one application 
however  the company believes that most of its revenues have been derived from fees associated with vantive support  vantive helpdesk and  to a lesser degree  vantive sales 
in any period  a significant portion of the company s revenues may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
however  no customer accounted for over of total revenues during  or as significant sales to a particular customer are typically non recurring  the company does not believe its future results are dependent on recurring revenues from any particular customer 
the company s revenues are derived from software license fees and fees for its services 
license revenues consist of license fees for the company s products as well as fees from sublicensing third party software products 
the company generally recognizes license fees upon shipment of software products if collection is probable  the license agreement requires payment within one year  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
if significant post delivery obligations exist or if a product is subject to customer acceptance  revenues are deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
revenues from services have to date consisted primarily of consulting revenues  customer support revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
consulting and training revenues generally are recognized as services are performed 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  which is typically one year 
if customer support services are included free or at a discount in a license agreement  such amounts are allocated out of the license fee at their fair market value based on the value established by independent sale of such customer support services to customers 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fee revenue is recognized upon shipment of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria 
in cases where license fee payments are contingent upon the acceptance of services  revenues from both the license and the service elements are deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
international revenues  or revenues derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  primarily in europe  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue in  and  respectively 
the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
to the extent that the company is unable to do so in a timely manner  the company s growth in international sales  if any  will be limited and the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  changes in foreign economic conditions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely impact the success of the company s international operations 
the company s foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies  and their results are translated into us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in particular  revenue from sales in the pacific rim could be adversely affected by declines in the value of such currencies against the dollar 
in addition  the overall weakness of these economies could adversely affect revenue from the pacific rim 
although the company has not experienced these effects in a meaningful way to date  there can be no assurance that it will not experience them in the future 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on its business  operating results and financial condition 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a number of forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
in this report  the words anticipate  believes  expects  future  intends  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof

the company increased its license revenues by from million in to million in and by to million in these increases were due to the market s growing acceptance of the company s products and the release of vantive enterprise in the third quarter of the company does not believe that the historical growth rates of license revenues will be sustainable or are indicative of future results 
service 
service revenues are primarily comprised of fees from consulting  customer support and  to a lesser extent  training services 
service revenues increased by from million in to million in and by to million in the increase in service revenues was primarily due to the increase in consulting  customer support and  to a lesser extent  training services associated with increased sales of the company s applications 
as the company implements its strategy of encouraging third party organizations such as systems integrators to become proficient in implementing the company s products  consulting revenues as a percentage of total revenues may decrease 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes the cost of product media  product duplication and manuals 
cost of license revenues increased from  or of related license revenues  in  to  or of related license revenues  in and to  or of related license revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars in cost of license revenues was primarily due to the increase in volume shipments of the company s software applications and the cost of sublicensing third party software 
service 
cost of service revenues is primarily comprised of employee related costs and fees for third party consultants incurred in providing consulting  customer support and training services 
cost of service revenues increased from million  or of related service revenues  in  to million  or of related service revenues  in and to million  or of related service revenues  in these increases in absolute dollars were due primarily to increases in consulting  support and training personnel and third party service providers during these periods 
the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of the related service revenues from to was primarily due to the variation in the resources used during the period 
the decrease in cost of service revenues as a percentage of the related service revenues from to was primarily due to economies of scale realized as a result of a higher level of service activity and due to customer support revenues constituting a higher proportion of total service revenues 
the cost of services as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to the mix of services provided by the company and the resources used to provide these services 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in and to million  or of revenues  in these increases in absolute dollars were primarily related to the expansion of the company s sales and marketing resources  increased commissions expenses as a result of higher sales levels and increased marketing activities  including trade show  direct mail and other promotional expenses 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in expanding its sales and marketing activities 
accordingly  sales and marketing expenses are anticipated to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues over the coming year 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in and to million  or of revenues in research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars between the years primarily as a result of an increase in personnel and outside contractors to support the company s product development activities 
in addition  research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues in compared to primarily due to product releases which includes vantive enterprise  vanweb  vantive on the go  vantive inventory  and vantive procurement 
over the coming years  the company plans to continue to invest heavily in research and development 
as a result  research and development expenses are anticipated to increase in absolute dollars over the coming year 
research and development expenses are generally charged to operations as incurred 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 internally generated costs which were eligible for capitalization for these periods were insignificant and the company charged all software development costs to research and development expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in and to million  or of revenues in general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars during these periods primarily due to the addition of staff and information system investments to support the growth of the company s business during these periods 
the company expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars over the coming year 
acquired in process research and development 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of innovative computer concepts  inc icc  a leading developer of software that improves spare parts procurement and management for field service applications the merger 
the company paid  in cash and issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of icc 
the company also assumed all outstanding icc options  which were converted to options to purchase approximately  shares of the company s common stock  resulting in a total purchase price of million including direct costs of the acquisition 
the merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and therefore the results of operations of icc and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities were included in the company s financial statements beginning on the acquisition date 
upon consummation of the merger  icc became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in connection with the acquisition  the company received an appraisal of the intangible assets  which indicated that approximately million represented in process research and development 
the acquired in process research and development was expensed in the quarter ended september  in addition  the company has recorded goodwill of approximately  that will be amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
provision for income taxes 
the company s provision for federal  state and foreign income taxes for fiscal was million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively affected due to the non deductibility of the charges related to the acquired in process research and development that resulted from the merger 
excluding the effect of these charges  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is that the company utilized its remaining domestic net operating loss carryforwards during and used  of operating loss carryforwards to benefit the remaining net operating loss carryforwards available to benefit future years are approximately  at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income loss and earnings loss per share 
net income loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income loss per basic share was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income loss per diluted share was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the financial statement effects of the merger  net income for the year ended december   would have been million  or per diluted share 
financial condition total assets as of december  increased million from december  the increase was primarily due to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and property and equipment 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million  primarily due to funds consisting of the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt 
on august   the company sold an aggregate of million in principal of convertible subordinated notes due to certain investors in the united states and outside the united states and incurred approximately million of offering expenses in connection with this issuance the convertible debt 
these notes have a coupon over a five year term and are convertible into the company s common stock at the investor s option  if and when the share price exceeds per share 
net accounts receivable increased million primarily due to increased revenues from sales of the company s products and services 
net property and equipment increased million primarily due to equipment purchases associated with supporting the growth of the company s business during this period 
current liabilities as of december  increased million from december  the increase was due to increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenues of million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased expense levels and accruals associated with a higher transaction volume and deferrals of revenues related to customer support 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided cash of million in the primary source of these funds was income from operations after the write off of acquired in process research and development costs  increase in accrued liabilities and deferred revenues  partially offset by increases in accounts receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
operating activities provided cash of million in the primary source of these funds was net income  increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and deferred revenues  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities and for the purchase of capital equipment 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of capital equipment and  to a lesser extent  for the purchase of short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital equipment acquisitions 
financing activities provided cash of million in the primary source of these funds was proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt 
the company intends to use the net proceeds of million from the convertible debt offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
financing activities provided cash of million in the primary source of these funds was proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options  partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity were its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company believes that existing cash and short term investment balances and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months 
while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  operating and investing activities may use cash and consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
business risks this report includes a number of forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views on future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
some of the forward looking statements are generally applicable to emerging growth companies or to the software industry  others are specific to the front office automation market and others are specific to the company 
in this report  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
future operating results uncertain 
the company has experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods 
the company does not believe that the historical growth rates of revenues will be sustainable or are indicative of future results 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
the company s future operating results will depend on many things  including demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and to control costs  the ability of the company to expand its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels and the ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop its sales strategy  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins 
competition for good salespeople and sales managers is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified sales personnel in the future 
the company s strategy also depends  in part  on relationships with third parties 
there also can be no assurance that the company will attract and retain appropriate high end integrators  resellers and other third party distributors to market the company s products effectively 
further  the company believes  based on interactions with its customers and potential customers  that the purchase of its products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital 
as a result  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company was not profitable prior to and there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
see business sales and marketing 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past varied and will probably in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  the timing of new product releases by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the company s products  changes in the company s and its competitors pricing policies  the mix of license and service revenue  budgeting cycles of its customers  seasonality  the mix of direct and indirect sales  changes in operating expenses  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic factors 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter is typically derived from non recurring sales to a limited number of customers 
accordingly  revenues in any one quarter are not indicative of revenues in any future period 
in addition  like many software applications businesses  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of each quarter  with these revenues concentrated in the last weeks of the quarter 
any significant deferral of purchases of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in any particular quarter and to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected 
product revenues are also difficult to forecast because the market for front office automation software products is rapidly evolving 
the company s sales cycle is typically six to nine months but varies substantially from customer to customer 
the company expects that sales made through indirect channels  which are harder to predict and usually have lower margins than direct sales  will increase as a percentage of total revenues 
the company operates with little order backlog because its products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result of these factors  quarterly revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues  because most of the company s expenses do not vary with revenues 
the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
in particular  if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  or other competitive factors require the company to invest significantly greater resources in research and development efforts  the company s operating margins in the future may be adversely affected 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s future revenues and net income are forward looking statements and actual results may vary substantially depending upon a variety of factors described in this paragraph and elsewhere in this report 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of the company s common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
rapid technological change and product development risks 
the front office automation software market is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services less marketable or obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s growth and future financial performance will depend in part on its ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements  respond to competitive products and achieve market acceptance 
these are increasingly complex and costly undertakings 
for example  the company s customers have adopted a wide variety of hardware  software  database  internet based and networking platforms and as a result  to gain broad market acceptance  the company must continue to support and maintain its products on a variety of such platforms 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database  internet based and networking platforms and by developing and introducing enhancements to its products and new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the company may not be able to successfully change other aspects of its business  such as its distribution channels or cost structure  if technological changes in its market require such change 
the company s product development efforts require substantial investments by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the company has in the past experienced development delays and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such delays in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such products will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or any other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors that may be detected at any point in the products life cycles 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its products and has delayed shipment of products during the period required to correct these errors 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found  resulting in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  injury to the company s reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see products and technology 
international operations  foreign currency fluctuations 
international revenue  or revenue derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue in  and  respectively 
the majority of this international revenue has come from europe 
the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
to the extent that the company is unable to do so in a timely manner  the company s growth in international sales  if any  will be limited and the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as the company continues to expand its international operations  significant costs may be incurred before achieving any additional international revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  future increases in the value of the us dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  changes in foreign economic conditions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely impact the success of the combined company s international operations 
the company s foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies  and their results are translated into us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in particular  revenue from sales in the pacific rim could be adversely affected by declines in the value of such currencies against the dollar 
in addition  the overall weakness of these economies could adversely affect revenue from the pacific rim 
although the company has not experienced these effects in a meaningful way to date  there can be no assurance that it will not experience them in the future 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on its business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the front office automation software market is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
because the company offers multiple applications that can be purchased separately or integrated as part of vantive enterprise  the company competes with a variety of other businesses depending on the target market for their applications software products 
these competitors include a select number of businesses targeting the enterprise level and department level front office markets  such as astea international  inc  aurum software  inc a subsidiary of the baan company  clarify  inc  onyx software  scopus technology  inc and siebel systems  inc 
in march  siebel systems  inc and scopus technology  inc 
announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for siebel to acquire all of the outstanding shares of scopus technology  inc the company also competes with a substantial number of businesses that offer products targeted at one or more specific markets  including the customer support market  the help desk market  the quality assurance market and the sales and marketing automation market  such as remedy corporation and software artistry  inc which was recently acquired by the ibm subsidiary  tivoli systems  inc 
the company believes that such point solution providers may expand their product offerings  which could provide increased competition for the company across its market segments 
the company also competes with third party professional service organizations that develop custom software and with internal information technology departments of customers that develop customer interaction applications 
among the company s current and potential competitors are also a number of large hardware and software businesses that may develop or acquire products that compete with the company s products 
in this regard  sap ag  oracle and the baan company have each introduced sales automation and or customer support modules as part of their application suites 
oracle has announced the creation of a network of third party dealers that will sell oracle s application suites exclusively to medium sized businesses 
the company expects that large software vendors in the enterprise resource planning market will continue to enter and pursue the front office automation market 
these competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than the company 
the company also expects that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
the company also expects that competition may increase as a result of both new software start ups entering the market as well as existing software industry vendors which may be planning to enter the market for front office applications 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  service and sale of their products than can the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its market include product features such as adaptability  scalability  ability to integrate with products produced by other vendors  functionality  ease of use and such other factors as product reputation  quality  performance  price  customer service and support  the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts and company reputation 
although the company believes that its products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources 
management of expanding operations  dependence upon key personnel 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its workforce 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has recently hired a significant number of employees  including senior sales  marketing  research and development and finance personnel and in order to maintain its ability to grow in the future  the company will be required to significantly increase its total headcount 
in addition  the company s future performance depends in significant part upon attracting and retaining key technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel 
in particular  delays in hiring sales or research and development personnel may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s officers or the inability to recruit other additional senior management could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition for such personnel is intense and the inability to retain its key technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel in the future on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
increased use of third party software 
the company currently markets a proprietary application development environment for its customers to tailor its products 
this application development environment is also used by the company to build and modify its products 
the company believes  based on interactions with its customers and potential customers  that it currently derives a competitive advantage from this proprietary application development environment 
however  the company believes that competitive pressures  technological changes demanded by customers and significant advances in the sophistication of third party application development tools such as visual basic will require the company to make greater use of third party software in the future 
the greater use of third party software could require the company to invest significant resources in rewriting some or all of its software applications products utilizing third party software and or to enter into license arrangements with third parties which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation and any competitive advantage associated with the proprietary development environment 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully rewrite its applications or enter into commercially reasonable licenses and the costs of  or inability or delays in  doing so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on emerging markets for front office automation software  product concentration 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on the growth in demand for individual front office automation applications as well as the number of organizations adopting comprehensive front office automation software information systems 
to date  much of the company s license revenues have resulted from sales of individual applications  particularly vantive support and vantive helpdesk 
the markets for these applications are relatively new and undeveloped and failure of these markets to expand would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  the company is investing in the sales  field service and quality automation markets 
should these markets fail to develop  not accept the company s products or cause the company to lose new business and or customers in its traditional markets  there would be an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that an important competitive advantage for its software applications is their ability to be integrated with one another and with other back office software applications to create an enterprise wide information system 
if the demand for integrated suites of front office automation applications fails to develop  or develops more slowly than the company currently anticipates  it could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s applications and on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the demand for the company s existing applications could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
need to expand distribution channels and successfully leverage third party relationships 
an important element of the company s distribution strategy is to expand its direct sales force  to create additional relationships with third parties and to dedicate certain direct sales resources and leverage third party relationships to cover key vertical markets 
an important element of the company s strategy is to integrate its products with products from enterprise resource planning erp vendors 
the company is currently investing and intends to continue to invest  significant resources toward these strategies  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins 
in this regard  the company has recently hired and continues to hire significant numbers of direct salespeople 
competition for salespeople is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing salespeople or that it can attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified salespeople in the future 
the strategy also depends  in large part  on attracting and retaining beneficial third party relationships 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain appropriate high end integrators  resellers  other third party distributors or erp vendors 
the company s agreements with these third parties are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
in addition  many of these third parties sell or co market competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any of these parties will continue to represent or recommend the company s products 
there also can be no assurance that the company will effectively identify key vertical markets 
the inability to recruit  or the loss of  important direct sales personnel  high end integrators  resellers  other third party distributors or erp vendors  or the failure to effectively identify key vertical markets  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
possible volatility of stock price 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions such as changes in interest rates  recessions or military conflicts  may materially and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on licensed technology 
vantive licenses technology on a non exclusive basis from several businesses for use with its products and anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
the inability of the company to continue to license these products or to license other products for use with its products or substantial increases in royalty payments under these third party licenses could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the effective implementation of the company s products depends upon the successful operation of these licensed products in conjunction with the company s products and therefore any undetected errors in such licensed products may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of the company s products  delay new product introductions and or injure the company s reputation 
such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that such measures will be adequate to protect the company from infringement of its technology 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  attempts may be made to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in particular  as the company provides its licensees with access to the proprietary information underlying the company s licensed applications  there can be no assurance that licensees or others will not develop products which infringe the company s proprietary rights 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  although the company has in the past and may in the future  receive communications alleging possible infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s target markets grows and the functionality of products in such markets overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

product liability 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions intended to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s agreements may not be effective 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company and the incorporation of products from other businesses may entail the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability action brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
year compliance 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from the th century dates 
as a result many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
although the company believes that its products and systems are year compliant  the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
failure of such third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to address any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the business  operating results and financial condition of the company s customers could be adversely affected to the extent that they utilize third party software products which are not year compliant 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products and services such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
as part of its business strategy  the company expects to review acquisition prospects that would complement its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage or enhance its technological capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  risks of entering markets which the company has no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company
