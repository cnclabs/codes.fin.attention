overview itron is a leading global provider to the utility industry of solutions for collecting  communicating and analyzing electric  gas and water usage data 
the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells  installs and services hardware  software and integrated systems for utilities to obtain  analyze and use meter data 
the company s major product lines include automatic meter reading amr systems and electronic meter reading emr or handheld systems 
the company both sells its products and provides outsourcing services 
the company s amr solutions involve the use of both radio and telephone technology to collect and communicate meter data 
the company s radio based amr solutions include off site amr  mobile amr and fixed network amr technology reading options 
off site amr utilizes a radio device attached to an itron handheld computer that interrogates meters equipped with the company s radio meter modules up to  feet away 
mobile amr uses a transceiver mounted in a vehicle to collect data from meters equipped with the company s radio meter modules as the vehicle passes by 
fixed network amr collects and transmits meter information via radio components that are mounted in a variety of fixed locations 
the company s emr systems product line includes ruggedized handheld computers to record visually obtained meter data  and supporting products and services 
outsourcing services may encompass the installation  operation and or maintenance of meter reading systems to provide meter information to a utility for billing and management purposes 
outsourcing contracts typically have terms of or more years 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of its products and services to the utility industry 
the company has experienced variability of operating results on both an annual and a quarterly basis due primarily to utility purchasing patterns and delays of purchasing decisions 
these delays have most recently been a result of changes or potential changes to the state and federal regulatory frameworks within which the electric utility industry operates and mergers and acquisitions in the utility industry 
results of operations revenues total revenues for the company increased million  or  to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
year ended december  revenues in millions increase increase decrease decrease amr systems handheld systems outsourcing total revenues amr systems revenues increased million  or  in over the prior year 
the increased revenues were primarily related to a contract to supply metering data collection software for the state of california s transmission grid  sales of telephone based systems from the company s newly acquired dci subsidiary  increased international amr sales and sales of amr hardware and software products introduced in late and average selling prices in for the company s meter modules remained approximately level with excluding shipments for outsourcing contracts  the company shipped approximately million and million amr meter modules in and  respectively 
amr systems revenues increased million  or  in over because more amr meter modules were shipped in the period 
the increased volumes resulted from the addition of new amr customers in  as well as accelerated installation schedules for a significant customer  public service company of colorado psco 
psco accounted for of amr revenues of total revenues in and of amr revenues of total revenues in  but only represented of amr revenues of total revenues in the company believes that amr revenues will continue to grow in the future 
however  this growth continues to depend upon the timing and resolution of industry regulatory reform issues in the united states  mergers and acquisitions in the utility industry  acceptance of new products  development of international markets  and other factors 
handheld systems revenues for increased million  or  from as a result of a large international emr sale to korea electric power company kepco 
handheld systems revenues for declined million  or  from due to unusually large system sales to two japanese utilities in these sales represented over of total handheld system sales in handheld systems revenues have steadily declined from of total company revenues in to in the company believes that revenues for handheld systems will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues as more utilities adopt and expand amr system deployments 
future handheld systems revenues are expected to be derived primarily from domestic upgrade and replacement business and further penetration into international markets 
the company had a substantial increase in outsourcing revenues in primarily due to initial revenue recognition for the company s largest outsourcing contract with the duquesne light company duquesne for a fixed network amr system 
additional outsourcing revenues in consisted of revenues from a mobile amr outsourcing agreement as well as revenue from a customer exercising its option to convert its outsourcing contract to a sale 
the company currently has two remaining outsourcing contracts under which it is recognizing revenue 
for the years ended december  and  the company had insignificant revenues from its first outsourcing contract 
revenues for outsourcing contracts are recognized using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of long term contract accounting under which the revenue recognized in any given period is measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
for more information on revenue recognition for outsourcing contracts see note to the financial statements 
in february  the company received acceptance from duquesne on the first critical milestone as defined in the company s amended contract agreement with duquesne 
the amended agreement  which was signed in the third quarter of  included revised completion dates for a number of critical milestones 
as in the original contract  the amended agreement provides for certain one time monetary penalties for failure to meet certain specified milestones 
the total amount of the remaining penalties  should the company fail to meet each of the remaining specified critical milestones  is approximately million 
the company is currently in compliance with its agreement with duquesne and believes it will fully satisfy all future critical milestones 
for additional information see amended duquesne agreement  an exhibit to the company s form q filed on november   and description of business certain risk factors dependence on the installation  operations and maintenance of amr systems pursuant to outsourcing contracts included elsewhere herein and duquesne fixed network amr contract 
outsourcing revenues are expected to decrease in from the level experienced in the current year  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  as the company did not sign any new outsourcing contracts during cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased by million  or  in over and million  or  in over gross margin was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the percentages for  and in the table below reflect cost of revenues as a percentage of corresponding revenue year ended december  cost of revenues increase increase decrease decrease amr systems handheld systems outsourcing total cost of revenues gross margin amr systems cost of revenues were of amr systems revenues in each of and the comparatively higher costs in and than those experienced in were primarily caused by additional overhead expenses from the company s expansion of manufacturing capacity 
the company expects amr systems costs as a percentage of revenues in to increase slightly as a result of a large fixed network amr order with a below average margin that was received in handheld systems cost of revenues were of revenues in compared to in and  respectively 
the cost increase was primarily due to the lower than average margin sale to kepco 
the company expects that handheld systems costs as a percentage of revenues will decrease somewhat in from the level experienced in due to an improved mix of business 
as a percentage of revenues  outsourcing costs were in compared to in and in the higher percentage in reflects lower than average margins for the company s first large scale fixed network amr system 
the company expects outsourcing costs as a percentage of revenues in to be comparable to those in operating expenses total operating expenses of million increased million  or  over but decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
operating expenses increased million in over and also increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
year ended december  operating expenses in millions increase increase decrease decrease sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total operating expenses total sales and marketing expenses in increased slightly over  but decreased as a percentage of revenues from to 
the lower percentage was driven by the company s focus on cost containment and the discontinuance of the genesis services division 
genesis services was formed in late for sales and marketing of amr fixed networks 
these efforts have been absorbed by the company s current sales and marketing organization 
sales and marketing expenses for of million increased both in total and as a percentage of revenues to in from in the year to year growth was primarily due to the formation of the genesis services division and expansion of technical sales and implementation staff for fixed networks 
the company expects sales and marketing expenses in to increase in total  but to decrease somewhat as a percentage of revenues from total product development expenses in decreased slightly from  but decreased significantly as a percentage of revenues from to 
the decrease was caused by the company s focus on cost containment  as well as the absence of a one time materials charge of million incurred in related to the redesign of the cell control unit and a new handheld computer 
partially offsetting these decreases were expenses from dci  which was acquired in the second quarter of product development expenses increased million in  or  over and also increased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the higher spending in was due to accelerated development of fixed network amr products  development of water and international meter modules  continued cost reduction programs and the million one time materials charge 
the company expects that product development expenses will increase in  but will decrease somewhat as a percentage of revenues compared to total general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in over  but remained at of revenues 
the higher expenses in were primarily due to incentive compensation costs which were not incurred in  as well as expenses from dci 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from to and increased as a percentage of revenue from to 
the increase was related to operating and maintenance expenses associated with expanded facilities  executive staff additions and third quarter severance charges related to a reduction in the company s workforce 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase in  but are expected to remain equal to or somewhat lower than as a percentage of revenues 
the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by year issues and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issues 
the company is in the process of modifying its software products and presently believes  with modification to existing software and converting to new software  that year issues will not pose significant operational problems and are not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
other income expense year ended december  other income expense in millions equity in affiliates gain on sale of business interest interest  net total other income expense the company incurred a loss of million during the year related to business activities from a joint venture with a utility partner 
offsetting this loss  was a gain from the sale to this partner of certain business activities previously performed by the joint venture including meter shop services and utility meter reading services 
gross interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the expense in resulted primarily from interest on the million convertible notes placed by the company in the first quarter of the year 
the expense in was the result of borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit in the last half of the year 
interest on long term mortgages also contributed to the expense in both and the company capitalized interest expense of  and  in and  respectively  primarily related to construction of outsourcing equipment 
the company generated net interest income in from investments  which were a result of positive cash flows from operations in the period and remaining cash balances from the company s stock offerings in and income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was approximately of pre tax income 
this compares to a effective rate of of pre tax loss 
the lower effective rate was a result of foreign operating losses for which no tax benefit was recorded and a cash to accrual accounting adjustment related to the merger with uts in march of the reported effective income tax rate was 
the company s effective income tax rate may vary from year to year because of fluctuations in foreign operating results  changes in tax jurisdictions in which the company operates  and changes in tax legislation 
financial condition year ended december  cash flow information in millions increase increase decrease decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash net operating activities consumed million in compared to million in increases in operating accounts during the year included million more in accounts receivable and an additional million growth in long term contracts receivable 
accounts receivable balances grew significantly during the last six months of primarily due to increased revenues during the third and fourth quarters and due to the timing of revenues during those quarters 
long term contracts receivable balances grew due to an increase in outsourcing revenues for the company 
outsourcing revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis while billing occurs as meters are read 
therefore  in the installation years of an outsourcing agreement the contract s long term receivable balance will grow 
it will begin to decline once the system is fully installed and all meters subject to the contract are being read 
during  increases in receivables were offset  to a large degree  by a decrease in inventory balances and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net operating activities consumed million in cash in compared with providing million in cash in most of the cash consumption was driven by growth in inventories  which were built in anticipation of amr customer orders in excess of what was realized 
the company expects to generate cash from operating activities in net investing activities consumed million of cash in  compared to million in and million in in  million was used to purchase equipment for outsourcing agreements 
this compares to million of purchases for outsourcing equipment in and million in new equipment investments from outsourcing contracts in are expected to be approximately one half the level 
during the company invested considerably less for property and equipment than during the previous two years  having spent million in compared to million in and million in additions to production capacity and an expansion of facilities at the company s headquarters in spokane accounted for most of the capital additions in both and the company substantially completed its capacity expansion program in the fourth quarter of and believes its amr meter module production capacity is sufficient for capital acquisitions in are expected to be slightly more than the level 
other investing activities in were not material 
other investing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from the liquidation of million of short term investments 
net financing activities generated million in compared to million in and million in net cash of million from the company s offering of convertible subordinated debt in march of was used to repay million of borrowings under the company s line of credit agreement

net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of cash proceeds from the company s stock offering in december the company believes its cash position at the end of and expected cash generation from operations in  together with renewal of its million credit facility in may  will be more than adequate to fund its operations throughout while the company expects its credit facility to be renewed in the ordinary course of business  there can be no assurance that it will be renewed  or will be renewed on terms acceptable to the company or at sufficient levels 
the company expects to finance the majority of future outsourcing contract investments with project financing
