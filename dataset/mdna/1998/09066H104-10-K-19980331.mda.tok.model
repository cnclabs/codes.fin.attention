risk factors an investment in shares of common stock of the company involves a high degree of risk 
many of the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that inherently involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with such forward looking statements which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements appear below 
in addition to the other information contained in this report  prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and cautionary statements before purchasing any shares of common stock of the company 
growth strategy and expansion 
the company has and will continue to seek to increase sales and profitability primarily through the acquisition or internal development of new product lines  additional customers and new business 
the company s historical revenue growth is primarily attributable to the company s acquisitions and new product development and  to a lesser extent  to increase revenues from the company s existing products 
the ability of the company to achieve its expansion objectives and to manage its growth effectively depends upon a variety of factors  including i the ability to internally develop new products  ii the ability to make profitable acquisitions  iii the integration of new facilities into existing operations  iv the hiring  training and retention of qualified personnel  v the establishment of new relationships or expansion of existing relationships with suppliers  vi the identification and lease of suitable premises on competitive terms and vii the availability of capital 
in addition  the implementation of the company s growth strategy will place significant strain on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on its systems and controls 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully will require it to continue to improve and expand such systems and controls 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company competes for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than those of the company 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any such transaction can be consummated  or that  if acquired  such new business can be integrated successfully and profitably into the company s operations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s historic rate of growth will continue to successfully expand  or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 
new product development  government regulation 
the company anticipates that in addition to its currently planned research and development expenses  it will spend additional significant amounts during fiscal and to fund research and development of certain technologies related to the area of molecular diagnostics 
this effort will be directed towards the development of medical products which will be used to detect or diagnose disease at a molecular level 
see item research and development 
there can be no assurance that any such diagnostic products will be successfully developed or that if developed  will be commercially successful 
unlike the company s current products  which are offered exclusively for research uses  such new products would be offered for the detection of diseases in human and animals 
prior to any such use  the company will be required to have such products approved by the fda following extensive clinical trials  management believes that it may invest up to million in these products which should be sufficient to cover the development of these products and necessary clinical trials  however  there can be no assurance that this level of investment will be sufficient 
furthermore  the company s investment will be made with no assurance that development efforts or clinical trials will be successful  or that the fda will approve such products 
in the event that the company is unable to develop a commercialized product from its research and development efforts  or the fda does not permit the company to manufacture and sell such products  or the company is unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond the million investment  the company could lose its entire investment in products 
competition 
the company is engaged in a segment of the health care products industry that is highly competitive 
competitors in the united states and elsewhere are numerous and include major pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  many of which have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and facilities than the company 
these companies may succeed in developing products competitive with those of the company that are more effective than any that have been or may be developed by the company and may also be more successful than the company in producing and marketing their products 
see item competition 
international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
the company believes that there is large demand for its products internationally and is aggressively pursuing such sales 
while the company expects that international sales will increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  particularly as a result of the acquisition of medgenix business  the company may not be successful in expanding its international sales 
the products of the company may not continue to meet with the same market acceptance as they currently receive  other competitive products may be more attractive to international customers and the cost of selling the company s products overseas may result in a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company continues to depend on third party distributors for a material portion of its international sales 
certain of the company s third party distributors may also act as reseller for competitors of the company and could devote greater effort and resources to marketing competitive products 
the loss of  or other significant reduction in sales to  certain of these third party distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
a large portion of the company s international sales are invoiced in non belgian currencies through the subsidiaries of biosource europe which are primarily german and french 
the company s gross margins from international sales  may  therefore  be materially adversely affected by significant exchange rate fluctuations between the belgian franc and these other currencies 
in addition  because international sales are not made in us dollars  currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact the company s results of operations 
although the company may be able to hedge against all or a portion of these currency exchange rate exposures  the company does not currently have plans to do so and  if the company chooses to do so  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
dependence on key management 
the company s success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the members of its management and scientific staff  particularly its chief executive officer  james h 
chamberlain 
the company has an employment contract with mr 
chamberlain  which expires at the end of the company maintains key man life insurance on mr 
chamberlain in the amount of million  of which the company is the sole beneficiary but there can be no assurance that the proceeds will be sufficient to offset the loss to the company in the event of his death 
the company does not maintain any insurance on the lives of its other senior management or scientific staff 
as the company continues to grow  it will continue to hire  appoint or otherwise change senior management and members of its scientific staff 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified members to management in the future 
the loss of services of mr 
chamberlain  or any key could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business 
see part iii 
volatility of stock price 
until april th  the company s common stock was quoted on the nasdaq small cap market  and there was substantial volatility in the market price of such common stock 
the trading price of the common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in management  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  legislative or regulatory changes  general trends in the industry  recommendations by securities industry analysts and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the common stock of many technology companies in particular and which have at times been related to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in addition  in the past the company has not experienced significant trading volume in its common stock  has not been actively followed by stock market analysts and has had limited market making support from broker dealers 
if market making support does not continue at present or greater levels and or the company does not continue to receive analyst coverage  the average trading volume in the company s common stock may not increase or even sustain its current levels  in which case  there can be no assurance that an adequate trading market will exist to sell large positions in the company s common stock

potential issuance of preferred stock  anti takeover provisions 
the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors  without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such preferred stock could have a material adverse affect on the market value of the common stock 
although the company has no present intention to issue any shares of its preferred stock 
there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future 
these provisions  as well as other provisions contained in the company s certificate of incorporation  also may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company
