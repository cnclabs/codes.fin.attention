the most significant component of the company s earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
net interest margin measures the effectiveness of generating net interest income on earning assets and is calculated by dividing net interest income by earning assets 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income tax equivalent basis  teb  by volume and rate  of the company for the periods indicated

tax equivalent net interest income for was million  an increase of million or from the increase in net interest income resulted from a million increase in average earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin  which improved basis points from in to in the increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an increased spread in rates during  as costs on interest bearing liabilities increased less than yields on earning assets 
the interest bearing liabilities cost and net interest margin were impacted by increased rates paid on interest bearing savings deposits and certificates  as well as the increased use of other borrowings  with higher costs  to fund a portion of the earning asset growth experienced in favorably impacting the net interest margin was an increase in the earning asset yield of basis points  resulting from a basis point increase in securities yields  coupled with a favorable change in the mix of earning assets 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost associated with the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  taking into consideration an evaluation of economic conditions  changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  and the level of nonperforming and other problem loans 
from december  to december   nonperforming loans decreased million to million 
meanwhile  the quality of the portfolio  as measured by the ratio of classified loans to total loans  reflected only modest deterioration during each quarter of  despite strong loan growth 
the ratio of classified loans to total loans increased from at december   to at december  the deterioration in credit quality was focused in the agricultural portfolio of three of the company s subsidiary banks and in segments of the company s retail portfolio 
farmers in a few of the company s markets experienced another season of adverse growing conditions  particularly for small grain crops 
the company also experienced some weakening in general consumer loans and credit card debt 
the reserve to outstanding loan ratio remained at in  while the reserve to nonperforming loan coverage increased from to from to the reserve for loan losses remains strong as compared to the company s peer group 
a complete discussion of asset quality and credit management can be found in the corporate risk profile section of item in this form k 
noninterest income 
noninterest income was million in compared to million in  representing a million or increase 
contributing to this increase in noninterest income were strong growth in service charge income of million or and trust commissions of thousand or 
also contributing to the increase in noninterest income was an increase in brokerage commissions of thousand or and an increase in insurance commissions of thousand or 
gains on loans sold in the secondary market grew as the volume of real estate mortgage financing increased in driven by a more favorable interest rate environment

affecting personnel costs were approximately million in salaries and benefits relating to acquisitions and expansion into new markets 
excluding these costs  personnel costs would have increased million or over excluding personnel costs  noninterest expense increased thousand or 
contributing to this increase was a thousand increase in furniture and equipment expense due to the depreciation expense associated with the upgrading of technology throughout the company and expansion into new markets 
also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense was a thousand increase in other expenses driven primarily by an increase of thousand in lending costs associated with the growth experienced in real estate mortgage lending and a thousand increase in amortization of intangible assets 
offsetting some of the increase in noninterest expense was a decrease of thousand in data processing expenses as the company began to realize cost savings associated with the execution of a new data processing contract in early also offsetting some of the increase in noninterest expense was a thousand decrease in fdic premiums and examination fees as fdic insurance premiums continued to decline and the company experienced a one time reduction in examination fees due to the conversion of its state chartered subsidiary banks to national charters 
a common industry statistic used to measure the productivity of banking organizations is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio measures the cost required to generate each dollar of revenue and is calculated by dividing recurring noninterest expense by tax equivalent net interest income and recurring noninterest income 
the company s efficiency ratio improved from in to in contributing to this improvement were significant increases in tax equivalent net interest income of and recurring noninterest income of  and modest growth in recurring noninterest expense of 
the company will continue its strategic focus to operate with an efficiency ratio below 
income taxes 
income tax expense  which consists of provisions for federal and state income taxes  was million for  representing an increase of million from comparing to  the company s effective tax rate also increased  from to  reflecting the impact of proportionately more taxable than tax exempt income in for further discussion and detail on the company s income taxes  refer to notes a and m to the consolidated financial statements found in the portion of part ii of this form k entitled item financial statements and supplementary data 
corporate risk profile management of risk 
managing risk is an essential part of the operation of a banking organization 
when risk is undertaken  the company expects a return commensurate with the risk 
if the risk profile is lowered  expectations of returns also are reduced 
by effectively managing and balancing the many risks involved in its business  the company believes consistent growth in earnings will occur 
the most prominent risks facing the company are credit risk  interest rate risk  and liquidity risk 
credit risk involves the risk of either not collecting interest when it is due or not receiving the principal balance of a loan or investment when it matures 
credit risk is the most significant risk the company must manage 
interest rate risk is the risk to net interest income caused by differences in the repricing and maturing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to fund its obligations and is largely a function of how effectively the company manages its other risks 
the company has established policies  procedures  and constraint levels to enable it to contain  accurately measure  monitor  and have senior management regularly review the company s total risk position 
credit risk management 
the company manages asset quality and controls credit risk through standardized lending policies and procedures and an internal loan review system 
the company  through its corporate credit administration and review department in cooperation with the subsidiary banks  has developed a credit philosophy aimed at minimizing credit risk by emphasizing the importance of a strong credit management process 
this process is essentially aimed at managing credit risk from the initial request through the life of the loan 
loan portfolio review 
one of the ways the company manages its credit risk is by maintaining a loan portfolio that management believes is well diversified by industry and size of loan 
the company also benefits from significant diversity among its banks  both as to loan type and local economic conditions 
for example  while small grain production was down in several markets  it was a good year for sugar beet producers  and milk prices were generally stable 
similarly  the hospitality industry was stronger in some geographical areas than in other areas 
as a result of this type of diversification  concentrations and risks in any single category are acceptable  as indicated by the following table summarizing the composition of the portfolio 
table vi loan portfolio december amount amount amount amount amount in thousands commercial and other      commercial real estate      construction      agricultural      residential real estate 
     construction      consumer      tax exempt      total      in recent years the composition of the company s loan portfolio has reflected a general stability in portfolio segments 
the company s subsidiary banks and bbfc continued to actively seek credit opportunities of all loan types including commercial real estate 
the company believes that even if the economy were to suffer modest deterioration  its exposure to significant commercial real estate losses in the foreseeable future is limited 
during  the company generated approximately million in new loan originations through its asset based lending and leasing services subsidiary  bbfc 
while of acceptable credit quality  these transactions tend to be somewhat less conventional than the loans originated by the subsidiary banks 
of the company s real estate lending  approximately is in commercial real estate loans  as compared to in and in these commercial real estate loans continue to consist primarily of loans to business customers who occupy the property or use it for income production 
the remaining in real estate lending is in the form of residential mortgages and home equity loans 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio experienced growth of million or between and  reflecting continued strong business loan demand and the effects of acquisitions 
the residential real estate loan portfolio experienced growth of million or as a result of acquisitions and the more favorable interest rate environment 
the company is not involved in lending to foreign countries 
while generally was another good year for the company s agricultural customers  a few isolated segments within the company s geographical area continued to experience difficulties 
the geographic dispersion of the subsidiary banks and diversity of agricultural products and activities were especially beneficial to the company s agricultural portfolio and mitigated the negative effect of the segments of the portfolio experiencing these poor conditions 
while certain of the company s subsidiary banks markets  comprising of the company s loan portfolio  were adversely impacted by the devastating effects of the flooding in the red river valley in april  the overall portfolio of the company continues to be strong 
as of december   the company has not experienced significant increases in past due loan balances or charge offs attributable to the floods 
the impact of the flood damage on the company s loan portfolio has been minimal  as many of the company s borrowers suffering losses were able to recover their losses from either grants through federal assistance programs or charitable organizations 
while the long term impact to the economies of these communities affected by the flood remains uncertain  there has been a short term boost in several segments of the economies  including the retail sales  housing  and hospitality segments 
net loan charge offs 
net loan charge offs increased to million in from thousand in and increased slightly from million in correspondingly  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased to 
in from 
in and increased slightly from 
in this increase in net charge offs can be attributed to a million increase in consumer net charge offs and a decline in commercial loan recoveries 
no individual charge off represented more than of the total 
table viii includes a summary of the charge offs by loan category for the past five years 
nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and other real estate acquired in loan settlements 
the accrual of interest on loans is suspended when the credit becomes days or more past due  unless the loan is fully secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans accrue interest but include concessions in terms which have been made as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
table vii summarizes the nonperforming assets as of december for the past five years

nonperforming assets were million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  correspondingly  as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned  nonperforming assets decreased to 
in from 
in  and down from 
in nonperforming loans were million and 
of total loans at december   compared to million and 
of total loans at december  and million and 
at december  the improvement in nonperforming loans is a function of the successful resolution of several large distressed credits and diligent monitoring and collection efforts by the subsidiary banks 
the subsidiary banks also continue to closely monitor emerging repayment issues 
the company will continue to enhance systems for monitoring portfolio segments to identify deterioration and non performance at the earliest possible stages 
reserve for loan losses 
the purpose of the reserve for loan losses is to provide for loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
even in the presence of credit policies and procedures  credit quality is subject to many economic and non economic factors that influence a borrower s financial condition over time 
table viii summarizes the activity in the reserve for loan losses along with the loan loss reserve allocation from through table viii reserve for loan losses december in thousands beginning of year      charge offs commercial and other  commercial real estate construction agricultural residential real estate construction consumer   tax exempt total      recoveries commercial and other  commercial real estate construction agricultural residential real estate construction consumer tax exempt total      net charge offs   provision for loan losses      reserve related to acquired assets  end of year      average loans      net charge offs average loans allocation of reserve for loan losses commercial and other      commercial real estate      construction agricultural      residential real estate      construction consumer      tax exempt  total allocated      unallocated      total      reserve to total loans the reserve for loan losses was million or of total loans at december   compared to million or at december  in establishing the reserve  management has considered its current credit process  changing industry conditions  economic and environmental considerations such as those being experienced in the red river valley of minnesota and north dakota  continued strong loan growth in  the company s level of unfunded commitments  and the type of credit extended as with expansion of lending by bbfc 
during  the company added approximately thousand to its current year provision for loan losses to address potential losses associated with the april flooding in the red river valley 
management believes the reserve is adequate to cover the risks inherent in the portfolio  specifically nonperforming loans and other loans that have been identified for careful monitoring 
although the company has prepared an allocation of the reserve based on loan and industry specific risk parameters  this allocation does not represent the total amount available for actual future loan losses in any single category  nor does it prohibit losses from being absorbed by portions allocated to other categories or by the unallocated portion 
interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect net interest income and balance sheet valuations 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to control this risk exposure 
the responsibility for this process rests with both the subsidiary banks and the company s asset liability committees the alcos 
the alcos establish policies and develop strategies to minimize company wide exposure to adverse interest rate trends 
the tools used to measure interest rate risk include gap analysis  simulation of future net interest income  and a valuation model which measures the sensitivity of balance sheet valuations to changes in interest rates 
a discussion of the valuation model can be found in the market risk section of item in this form k 
table ix summarizes the company s repricing gap for various time intervals 
table ix interest rate sensitivity at december  repricing or maturing within over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets loans      securities      other assets     total      interest sensitive liabilities noninterest bearing deposits     interest bearing deposits     short term borrowings     long term debt     other liabilities and shareholder s equity   total      repricing gap     cumulative repricing gap    cumulative gap to total assets as indicated in table ix  assets reprice slightly faster than liabilities as of december  with this balance sheet position  net interest income is projected to increase slightly in an environment of rising short term rates and decline slightly in a declining rate environment 
the company also uses simulation modeling of future net interest income as a risk management tool 
policy limits have been established for net interest income at risk over the next months from a basis point change in the level of rates 
simulation modeling results indicate that net interest income would decline in a declining rate environment 
the projected change is within the current policy guideline which requires that the change in net interest income over the next months not exceed 
liquidity management 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the commitments of the company 
the alcos are responsible for managing balance sheet and off balance sheet commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the company s financial objectives 
alcos meet regularly to review funding capacity  current and forecasted loan demand  investment opportunities  and liquidity positions as outlined in the company s liquidity policy 
with this information  the alcos guide changes in the balance sheet structure to provide for adequate ongoing liquidity 
several factors provide a favorable liquidity position for the company 
the first is the ability to acquire and retain deposits 
core deposits  which generally include all deposits and repurchase agreements except for those greater than thousand of nonpersonal and public entities  and certain other public funds  provide a historically stable source of funding 
the company has a high proportion of core deposits to total liabilities compared to industry averages  this index was approximately for and for the company s available for sale securities portfolio is a secondary source of liquidity because of its readily marketable nature and predictable stream of maturities  as approximately of the portfolio matures within while the company prefers to fund its balance sheet with core deposits  a third source of liquidity is the company s ready access to regional and national wholesale funding sources  including federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  and brokered deposits 
the company has also established a million unsecured credit facility which is used primarily to provide funding availability for non bank activities 
capital management 
the company s capital position is both a strength and an opportunity  as it provides a degree of safety and soundness and a foundation for future growth 
the capital position of the company and the subsidiary banks reflects management s commitment to maintain ratios above the regulatory minimums 
table x capital ratios regulatory requirement equity to assets equity to tangible assets tier i capital tier i and tier ii capital leverage ratio calculations include redeemable class a common stock 
computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  including the unrealized market value adjustment of securities available for sale 
computed exclusive of the unrealized market value adjustment of securities available for sale 
the company s tier i capital ratio at december  was  its total risk adjusted capital ratio tier i plus tier ii was  and its tier i leverage ratio was 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia required the establishment of a capital based supervisory system of prompt corrective action for all depository institutions 
the federal reserve board s implementation of fdicia defines well capitalized institutions as those whose tier i capital ratio equals or exceeds  total risk based capital ratio equals or exceeds  and leverage ratio equals or exceeds 
the company s subsidiary banks ratios in each of these categories met or exceeded the well capitalized ratios as of december  impact of inflation 
the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are primarily monetary in nature 
because banks generally have an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities  inflation  in theory  will cause a loss of purchasing power in the value of shareholder s equity 
other sections of this financial review provide the information necessary for an understanding of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates 
balance sheet analysis table xiii on pages and sets forth for the periods indicated the average balance sheets and related yields and rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
sources of funds the company s balance sheet strength rests in its strong capital position and its share of the deposit base in the communities served 
the company relies on three major sources of funding core deposits  short term borrowings  and equity capital 
the diversity and supply of this funding base enable the company to replace maturing liabilities and finance asset growth on an ongoing basis

average short term borrowings  which include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury tax and loan notes  fhlb advances with maturities of one year or less  and advances under an unsecured revolving credit facility  increased from million in to million in this increase can be attributed to an increase in the company s use of fhlb advances 
while average total deposits increased million in  average earning assets increased million  creating the need for this funding source 
the associated interest rate risk was monitored closely and steps were taken to match the repricability of assets and liabilities 
long term debt 
average long term debt  which includes fhlb advances with maturities of greater than one year  and installment promissory notes  increased million 
this increase can be attributed to an increase in the company s use of fhlb advances to fund the strong asset growth as discussed below

provision for loan losses 
from december  to december   nonperforming loans increased million to million 
however  the quality of the portfolio  as measured by the ratio of classified loans to total loans  reflected only modest deterioration during each quarter of  despite strong loan growth 
the modest deterioration in credit quality occurred primarily in the commercial real estate  agricultural  and consumer segments of the loan portfolio

noninterest income was million in compared to million in  representing a million or increase 
contributing to this increase in noninterest income were strong growth in service charge income of million or and brokerage commissions of million or 
also contributing to the increase in noninterest income was an increase in insurance commissions of million  due in large part to the acquisition of the united agency in january gains on loans sold in the secondary market grew as the volume of real estate mortgage financing increased in driven by a more favorable interest rate environment

contributing to this increase was a million increase in furniture and equipment expense primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the upgrading of technology throughout the company 
also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense was a million increase in other expenses driven by a thousand increase in lending costs associated with the growth experienced in real estate mortgage lending  a thousand increase in amortization of intangible assets  and increases in several other miscellaneous categories 
offsetting some of the increase in noninterest expense was a continued decline in fdic insurance premiums in income taxes 
income tax expense  which consists of provisions for federal and state income taxes  was million for  representing an increase of million from comparing to  the company s effective tax rate increased from to  reflecting the impact of proportionately more taxable than tax exempt income in impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer systems being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs used by the company that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using for the year as the year rather than the year  or vice versa 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including an inability to process transactions  calculate interest accruals  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on its assessment  the company determined that it will be required to upgrade or replace some portions of the software used by it so that its computer systems will properly recognize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated or eliminated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the company continues to bear some risk related to the year issue if other entities not affiliated with the company do not appropriately address their own year compliance issues 
the company has not yet evaluated the full impact of the year issue if third party vendors and or customers do not resolve this issue on a timely basis 
based on its assessments  management does not believe the cost of addressing the year issue will be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations
