the bank also sold million in gnma mortgage backed securities

however  as a result of various legislative and regulatory changes since  the commercial and consumer lending powers of the bank increased substantially 
consequently  the bank initiated a diversification strategy in fiscal year which included a significant increase in commercial real estate lending 
commercial real estate lending was temporarily discontinued in and only originations required by previous funding commitments were made 
in  the bank began to originate small business and commercial real estate loans in its primary market area 
the bank s current lending activity is concentrated on lending to consumers and small businesses in the mid atlantic region of the united states

the above schedule does not include any prepayment assumptions 
although prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the current interest rate environment  management believes that the actual repricing and maturity of the loan and lease portfolio is significantly shorter than is reflected in the above table as a result of prepayments 
residential real estate lending 
wsfs originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to  however  the bank generally requires private mortgage insurance for up to of the mortgage amount on mortgage loans whose loan to value ratio exceeds 
the bank does not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer 
on a limited basis  the bank originates loans with loan to value ratios exceeding without a private mortgage insurance requirement 
at december   the balance of all such loans was approximately million of which million related to lending intended to satisfy the requirements of the community reinvestment act 
generally  residential mortgage loans originated or purchased are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by fhlmc to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market  however  unless loans are specifically designated for sale  the company holds newly originated loans in portfolio for long term investment 
among other things  title insurance is required  insuring the priority of its lien  and fire and extended coverage casualty insurance for the properties securing the residential loans 
all properties securing residential loans made by the bank are appraised by independent appraisers selected by the bank and subject to review in accordance with bank standards 
the majority of residential real estate adjustable rate loans currently originated have interest rates that adjust every year  with the change in rate limited to two percentage points at any adjustment date 
the adjustments are generally based upon a margin currently percent over the weekly average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity  as published by the federal reserve board 
generally  the maximum rate on these loans is up to six percent above the initial interest rate 
the bank generally underwrites adjustable rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market criteria 
the bank does not originate adjustable rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization 
consistent with industry practice in its market area  the bank has originated adjustable rate mortgage loans with initially discounted interest rates 
all such loans are underwritten at the fully indexed rate 
the retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans in the bank s loan portfolio helps mitigate the bank s risk to changes in interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower 
further  although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases 
the original contractual loan payment period for residential loans originated is normally to years 
because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty  such loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time 
first mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses on adjustable and fixed rate loans  which are provisions giving the institutions the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rate on existing fixed rate mortgage loans to current market rates 
the bank enforces due on sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws 
commercial real estate and commercial lending 
as a federal savings bank  the bank is permitted to invest up to of its consolidated capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to of its assets in commercial loans 
prior to  the bank had been operating under a capital plan and was subject to the terms and conditions of a capital directive 
consequently  wsfs had discontinued the origination of commercial real estate loans other than renewal of performing loans or funding outstanding commitments 
beginning in  after the plan and directive were lifted  the bank began to originate small business commercial and real estate loans in its primary market area 
wsfs has offered commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi family and other commercial real estate 
generally  loan to value ratios for such loans do not exceed of appraised value at origination 
as a result of subsequent changes in the real estate market  however  current loan to value ratios on certain loans could effectively be in excess of 
prior to the restrictions noted above  the bank offered commercial construction loans to developers 
these loans were made as construction permanent loans  which provided for disbursement of loan funds during construction and automatic conversion to permanent loans upon completion of construction 
such construction loans were made on a short term basis  usually not exceeding two years  with interest rates indexed to the wsfs prime rate and adjusted periodically as the bank s prime rate changed 
the loan appraisal process includes the same criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans as well as completed plans  specifications  comparables and cost estimates 
these items are used  prior to approval of the credit  as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed 
policy requires that all appraisals are to be reviewed independently of the commercial lending area 
generally  the loan to value ratio for construction loans does not exceed 
the initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined based upon the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan 
at december   million was committed for construction loans  of which million had been disbursed 
the bank s commercial lending  excluding real estate loans  includes loans for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes 
these loans generally range in amounts up to approximately million  and their terms range from less than one year to seven years 
the loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to the bank s prime rate or libor at the time of closing 
the bank intends to continue originating commercial loans to small businesses in its market area 
commercial  commercial mortgages and construction lending entail significant risk as compared with residential mortgage lending 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the economy generally 
the majority of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans is concentrated in delaware and surrounding areas 
construction loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which  due to various factors  is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
moreover  because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  delays arising from labor problems  material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies  it is relatively difficult to accurately estimate the total loan funds required to complete a project and or determine the related loan to value ratios 
federal law limits the extensions of credit to any one borrower to of unimpaired capital  or  if the additional incremental is secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value that can be determined by reliable and continually available pricing 
a single large extension of credit by the bank would be limited by this of capital restriction  except if the extension of credit would be fully or partially secured by us treasury securities 
extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds  such as standby letters of credit  but do not include unfunded loan commitments 
in april  the bank originated a million loan to refinance an employee stock ownership plan esop loan of a company 
approximately of the loan is secured by discounted us treasury securities 
the portion of the loan that is secured by us treasury securities is exempt from the above lending limits 
at december   no borrower had collective outstandings exceeding the above limits 
consumer lending 
consumer loans not including certain consumer loans such as home equity lines of credit and other residential real estate secured loans may be made in an amount up to of the bank s assets 
the company intends to emphasize consumer lending in the future as a means of enhancing portfolio yields and capitalizing on existing customer relationships 
the primary consumer credit products  excluding leases  of the company are equity secured installment loans and home equity lines of credit 
with a home equity line of credit the borrower is granted a line of credit up to of the appraised value net of any senior mortgages of the residence 
this line of credit is secured by a mortgage on the borrower s property and can be drawn upon at any time 
at december   the bank had extended a total of million in home equity lines of credit  of which million had been drawn at the date 
home equity lines of credit offer federal income tax advantages in certain circumstances the interest paid on a home equity loan remains deductible and the convenience of checkbook access and revolving credit features 
over the past few years  however  home equity lines of credit have decreased as low interest rates offered on first and second mortgage loans have enabled consumers to refinance their mortgages and consolidate debt 
although home equity lines of credit expose the company to the risk that falling collateral values may leave it inadequately secured  the company has not had any significant adverse experience to date 
since  the focus of wsfs credit corporation wcc  formerly star states leasing corporation  has been to finance leases indirectly 
these leases are secured by motor vehicles and originated through automobile dealerships 
during  wcc originated more than  leases  which approximated million in new assets 
at december   the corporation reclassified approximately million in leases originated by wcc to operating leases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
approximately million of leases as of december  have also been reclassified as operating leases herein 
the table below sets forth consumer loans by type  in dollar amounts and percentages  at the dates indicated

wsfs has traditionally engaged in lending activities primarily in delaware and contiguous areas of neighboring states although  as a federal savings bank  the bank may originate  purchase and sell loans throughout the united states 
wsfs has also purchased limited amounts of loans from outside its normal lending area when such purchases are deemed appropriate and consistent with the bank s overall practices 
the bank originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential real estate loans through banking offices 
in addition  wsfs has established relationships with correspondent banks  mortgage brokers and real estate developers for loan referrals 
during  wsfs originated million of residential real estate loans compared to originations of million 
from time to time  the bank has purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with its ongoing asset and liability management objectives 
purchases of residential real estate loans from correspondents and brokers primarily in the northeast region of the united states totalled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
residential real estate loan sales totaled million in and million for both and while the bank generally intends to hold loans for the foreseeable future  wsfs  beginning in  has undertaken to sell newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to control the interest sensitivity of its balance sheet 
during the second half of the corporation began to hold for investment certain of its fixed rate mortgage loans  with terms under years  consistent with current asset liability management strategies 
the bank serviced for others approximately million of residential loans at december  compared to million at december  the company also services residential loans for its portfolio totaling million and million at december  and the bank originates commercial real estate and commercial loans through the bank s commercial lending department 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes and also include business loans secured by nonresidential real estate 
during  the bank originated million of commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to million in these amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not reflect amounts outstanding on such loans 
the bank s consumer lending is conducted primarily through the branch offices and is supported by a consumer credit department credit investigation unit 
wsfs originates a variety of consumer credit products  including home improvement loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans 
during  such consumer loan originations aggregated million compared to million in additionally  wsfs credit corporation originated approximately million of operating leases in and million in see consumer lending for a further discussion regarding consumer loan originations 
all loans to one borrower exceeding  in aggregate must be approved by a management loan committee 
minutes of the management loan committee meetings and individual loans exceeding million approved by the management loan committee are subsequently reviewed by the executive committee and board of directors of wsfs  with separate approval needed for all loans to any borrower who has direct or indirect outstanding commitments in excess of million or for any additional advances or extensions on loans previously classified by the bank s regulatory authorities or the bank s asset review department 
officers of the bank have authority to approve smaller loans in graduated amounts  depending upon their experience and management position 
fee income from lending activities 
the bank realizes interest and loan fee income from lending activities  including fees for originating loans and for servicing loans and loan participations sold 
the institution also receive commitment fees for making commitments to originate construction  residential and commercial real estate loans 
additionally  loan fees related to existing loans are received  which include prepayment charges  late charges and assumption fees 
the bank offers a range of loan commitments for which fees are charged depending on lengths of the commitment periods 
as part of the loan application  the borrower also pays the bank for out of pocket costs in reviewing the application  whether or not the loan is closed 
the interest rate charged on the mortgage loan is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved 
loan fees that are considered adjustments of yield in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are reflected in interest income and represented an immaterial amount of interest income during the three years ended december  loan fees other than those considered adjustments of yield are reported as loan fee income  a component of other income 
loan and lease loss experience  problem assets and delinquencies the company s results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the company endeavors to manage its portfolios to identify problem loans and leases as promptly as possible and take actions immediately which will minimize losses 
to accomplish this  the bank s asset review department monitors the asset quality of the company s loan  lease and investment in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the chief financial officer and the executive committee of the board of directors

regulation regulation of the company general 
the company is a registered savings and loan holding company and is subject to office of thrift supervision ots regulation  examination  supervision and reporting requirements 
as a subsidiary of a holding company  the bank is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with the company and other affiliates 
activities restrictions 
the company currently operates as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
there generally are no restrictions on the activities of a unitary holding company 
if the company were to acquire another thrift and operate it as a separate entity  it would become subject to the activities restrictions on multiple holding companies 
among other things  no multiple savings and loan holding company or subsidiary thereof which is not a savings association may commence  or continue after a limited period of time after becoming a multiple savings and loan holding company or subsidiary thereof  any business activity other than i furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings association  ii conducting an insurance agency or escrow business  iii holding  managing  or liquidating assets owned by or acquired from a subsidiary savings institution  iv holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings institution  v acting as trustee under deeds of trust  vi those activities authorized by regulation as of march  to be engaged in by multiple holding companies  or vii unless the director of ots by regulation prohibits or limits such activities for savings and loan holding companies  those activities authorized by the federal reserve board as permissible for bank holding companies 
those activities described in vii above also must be approved by the director of ots prior to being engaged in by a multiple savings and loan holding company 
transactions with affiliates  tying arrangements transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a savings association is any company or entity which controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the savings association 
in a holding company context  the parent holding company of a savings association such as the company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings association 
generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which the savings institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus and ii require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non affiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by sections a and b  no savings association may i lend or otherwise extend credit to an affiliate  except for any affiliate which engages only in activities which are permissible for bank holding companies  or ii purchase or invest in any stocks  bonds  debentures  notes or similar obligations of any affiliate  except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association 
savings associations are also subject to section of the bank holding company act of bhca which prohibits a depository institution from extending credit  offering services  or fixing or varying the consideration for any extension of credit or service on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or certain of its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services from a competitor of the institution  subject to certain limited exceptions 
restrictions on acquisitions 
savings and loan holding companies are prohibited from acquiring  without prior approval of the director of ots  i control of any other savings association or savings and loan holding company or substantially all the assets thereof  or ii more than of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof which is not a subsidiary 
under certain circumstances  a savings and loan holding company is permitted to acquire  with the approval of the director of ots  up to of the voting shares of an under capitalized savings association pursuant to a qualified stock issuance without that savings association being deemed controlled by the holding company 
except with the prior approval of the director of ots  no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than of such company s stock  may also acquire control of any savings association  other than a subsidiary savings association  or of any other savings and loan holding company 
the director of ots may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if i the company involved controls a savings institution which operated a home or branch office in the state of the association to be acquired as of march   ii the acquirer is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the federal deposit insurance act  or iii the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit institutions to be acquired by state chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings institutions 
the laws of delaware do not specifically authorize out of state savings associations or their holding companies to acquire delaware chartered savings associations 
the statutory restrictions on the formation of interstate multiple holding companies would not prevent the bank from entering into other states by mergers or branching 
ots regulations permit federal associations to branch in any state or states of the united states and its territories 
except in supervisory cases or when interstate branching is otherwise permitted by state law or other statutory provision  a federal association may not establish an out of state branch unless the federal association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under ss 
a of the internal revenue code or as a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act and the total assets attributable to all branches of the association in the state would qualify such branches taken as a whole for treatment as a domestic building and loan association or qualified thrift lender 
federal associations generally may not establish new branches unless the association meets or exceeds minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ots will also consider the association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act of in connection with any branch application 
regulation of the bank general

the bank must file reports with ots describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere herein 
regulatory capital requirements 
under ots capital regulations  savings institutions must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to of adjusted total assets and total capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
in addition  ots regulations impose certain restrictions on savings associations that have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total assets of less than or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examination rating system 
for purposes of these regulations  tier capital has the same definition as core capital 
the ots capital rule defines core capital as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill and  subject to certain limitations  mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships 
tangible capital is given the same definition as core capital but does not include qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings institution s intangible assets except for limited amounts of mortgage servicing rights 
the ots capital rule requires that core and tangible capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in nonincludable subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks  other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies 
adjusted total assets for purposes of the core and tangible capital requirements are a savings institution s total assets as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  increased by certain goodwill amounts and by a prorated portion of the assets of unconsolidated includable subsidiaries in which the savings institution holds a minority interest 
adjusted total assets are reduced by the amount of assets that have been deducted from capital  the savings institution s minority investments in unconsolidated includable subsidiaries and  for purposes of the core capital requirement  qualifying supervisory goodwill 
at december   the bank was in compliance with both the core and tangible capital requirements 
the risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
under the ots risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight 
mortgage backed securities that qualify under the secondary mortgage enhancement act  including those issued  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by the fnma or fhlmc  are assigned a risk weight 
single family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding  fixed rate multi family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding  and average annual occupancy rates over  and certain qualifying loans for the construction of one to four family residences pre sold to home purchasers are assigned a risk weight of 
consumer loans  non qualifying residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans  repossessed assets and assets more than days past due  as well as all other assets not specifically categorized  are assigned a risk weight of 
the portion of equity investments not deducted from core or supplementary capital is assigned a risk weight 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital  provided the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital 
supplementary capital is defined to include certain preferred stock issues  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that do not qualify as core capital  certain approved subordinated debt  certain other capital instruments and a portion of the savings institution s general loan and lease loss allowances 
the ots risk based capital standards require savings institutions with more than a normal level of interest rate risk to maintain additional total capital 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
a savings association with more than normal interest rate risk is required to deduct an interest rate risk component equal to one half of the excess of its measured interest rate risk over the normal level from its total capital for purposes of determining its compliance with the ots risk based capital guidelines 
at december   the bank was in compliance with the ots risk based capital requirements 
loans to directors  officers and stockholders 
under section h of the federal reserve act  loans to an executive officer or director or to a greater than stockholder of a savings association and certain affiliated interests of either  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests  the association s loans to one borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to all such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans  above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency  to directors  executive officers and greater than stockholders of a savings association  and their respective affiliates  unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the association with any interested director not participating in the voting 
the federal reserve board has prescribed the loan amount which includes all other outstanding loans to such person  as to which such prior board of director approval if required  as being the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
further  loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not discriminate in favor of insiders 
section h also prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors 
savings associations are subject to the requirements and restrictions of section g of the federal reserve act which requires that loans to executive officers of depository institutions not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded to other borrowers  requires approval for such extensions of credit by the board of directors of the institution  and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type  amount and terms of credits to such officers 
section of the bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
dividend restrictions 
the bank is prohibited from paying any dividend or making any other capital distribution if  after making the distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized within the meaning of the ots prompt corrective action regulations 
ots regulations impose additional limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions including stock repurchases and cash mergers by the bank 
under these regulations  a savings institution that  immediately prior to  and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to  a proposed capital distribution  has total capital as defined by ots regulation that is equal to or greater than the amount of its fully phased in capital requirements a tier association is generally permitted  after notice  to make capital distributions during a calendar year in the amount equal to the greater of a of its net income for the previous four quarters  or b up to of its net income to date during the calendar year plus an amount that would reduce by one half the amount by which its ratio of total capital to assets exceeded its fully phased in risk based capital ratio requirement at the beginning of the calendar year 
a savings institution with total capital in excess of current minimum capital ratio requirements but not in excess of the fully phased in requirements a tier association is permitted  after notice  to make capital distributions without ots approval of up to of its net income for the previous four quarters  less dividends already paid for such period 
a savings institution that fails to meet current minimum capital requirements a tier association is prohibited from making any capital distributions without the prior approval of the ots 
a tier association that has been notified by the ots that it is in need of more than normal supervision will be treated as either a tier or tier association 
at december   the bank was a tier association 
the ots may prohibit any savings institution from making a capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted by the regulation  if the ots determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
deposit insurance 
the bank may be charged semi annual premiums by the fdic for federal insurance on its insurable deposit accounts up to applicable regulatory limits 
the fdic may establish an assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums which protects the insurance fund and considers the fund s operating expenses  case resolution expenditures  income and effect of the assessment rate on the earnings and capital of members 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic which is determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective action 
within each capital group  institutions will be assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
because the bif achieved its statutory reserve ratio of of insured deposits  the fdic has eliminated deposit insurance premiums for most bif members 
the fdic  however  continues to assess bif member institutions to fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to help fund takeovers of insolvent thrifts 
until december   bif members will be assessed at the rate of basis points on deposits for fico payments while saif members will be assessed at the rate of basis points on deposits 
after december   bif and saif members will be assessed at the same rate 
prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution generally is i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
significantly uncapitalized institutions and their holding companies may become subject to more severe sanctions including limitations on asset growth  restrictions on capital distributions by the holding company and possible divestiture requirements 
institutions generally must be placed in receivership within specified periods of time after they become critically undercapitalized 
under the ots regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  the ots measures a savings institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
a savings institution that is not subject to an order or written directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level is deemed well capitalized if it also has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater 
an adequately capitalized savings institution is a savings institution that does not meet the definition of well capitalized and has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier capital risk based ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater if the savings institution has a composite camel rating 
an undercapitalized institution is a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or if the institution has a composite camels rating 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is defined as a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
a critically undercapitalized savings institution is defined as a savings institution that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general wsfs financial corporation company or corporation is a savings and loan holding company headquartered in wilmington  delaware 
substantially  all of the corporation s assets are held by its subsidiary  wilmington savings fund society  fsb the bank or wsfs  the largest thrift institution headquartered in delaware and among the four largest financial institutions in the state on the basis of total deposits acquired in market 
the corporation s primary market area is the mid atlantic region of the united states which is characterized by a diversified manufacturing and service economy 
the bank provides residential real estate  commercial real estate  commercial and consumer lending services and funds these activities primarily with retail deposits and borrowings 
the banking operations of wsfs are presently conducted from retail banking offices located in the wilmington and dover  delaware areas 
deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
additional subsidiaries of the bank include wsfs credit corporation wcc  which is engaged primarily in indirect motor vehicle leasing  investment group  inc  which markets various insurance products and securities through the bank s branch system  and community credit corporation ccc  which specializes in consumer loans secured by first and second mortgages 
an additional subsidiary  star states development company ssdc  is currently inactive with the exception of one remaining parcel of land which is expected to be sold in the second quarter of in november  the bank acquired providential home income plan  inc providential  a san francisco  california based reverse mortgage lender 
the management and operations of providential were later merged into the bank in november the long term goal of the corporation is to maintain its high performing financial services company status  focused on its core banking business while developing unique niche businesses 
beginning in  the corporation focused its efforts on developing new businesses and avenues for asset growth 
toward that end  the corporation opened the consumer finance subsidiary  ccc  and acquired providential 
these retail investments  combined with the growth in the investment portfolios  have favorably impacted net interest income and earnings since and are expected to provide favorable returns on these investments in the coming years 
such investments for the future were possible since the bank became well capitalized in the second quarter of this status was largely due to operating earnings and the corporation s capital infusion of million of the proceeds of a million debt offering which was completed in december in the third quarter of  the bank recognized a gain of million  net of taxes and a supplemental contribution to the corporation s k plan  from the sale of deposits and certain real estate of four branches of its former bank subsidiary  fidelity federal savings and loan association the association  located in the northeast section of philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the sale allowed the corporation to focus on its primary market area while also enhancing capital 
record earnings in were surpassed in as the corporation recorded earnings of million  of which million was from operations and  as mentioned  million was from the sale transaction 
earnings for the year ended december  and were million 
net income for  and included the recognition of tax benefits from prior net operating losses from wsfs and its subsidiaries 
excluding the one time net gain on the sale of the association s deposits  income before taxes increased million from to and million from to the following discussion focuses on the major components of the company s operations and presents an overview of the significant changes in the corporation s results of operations for the past three fiscal years and financial condition during the past two fiscal years 
this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the corporation recorded net income of million in both and compared with million in earnings for all three years included the recognition of tax benefits 
earnings for were also significantly impacted by a nonrecurring after tax gain of million on the sale of deposits and certain assets of the association 
excluding the tax benefits and the gain on the sale of deposits  net income for increased million over  and income increased million over net interest income 
net interest income is the most significant component of operating income to the corporation 
net interest income is reliant upon the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the difference or spread between the respective yields earned and rates paid 
the interest rate spread is influenced by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that affect interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the level of nonperforming loans can also impact the interest rate spread by reducing the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
at december   the corporation reclassified approximately million in leases originated by its vehicle leasing subsidiary to operating leases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accordingly  income on these leases  which previously would have been classified as interest income  has been presented as other income  consistent with the operating lease treatment 
prior period amounts have also been restated to conform their presentation 
this reclassification did not result in a material effect on reported net income of any year herein 
in  only approximately of leases and their associated income were accounted for as operating leases 
net interest income decreased to million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income over the three year period was due to the increase in the operating lease portfolio  the income from which is treated as fee income  and the decline in finance leases  the income from which is treated as interest income 
excluding the effects of reclassification of direct finance leases to operating leases discussed above  net interest income would have increased to million in from million in the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rates change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii net change

interest income and expense  on a tax equivilized basis  increased million and million  respectively  between and the bank s acquisition of million in mortgage backed securities in the first quarter of and million in other investment securities purchased during contributed favorably to net interest income 
the growth in the operating lease portfolio and the decline in the financing lease portfolio as well as additional wholesale investment activities contributed to the decrease in the interest rate spread and margin between and between and interest income and expense increased million and  respectively 
these increases were due in part to the impact of an investment growth strategy which was implemented in provision for loan losses 
the corporation considers  among other things  identifiable and inherent risks in its loan portfolio in periodically establishing the amount of the provision for loan losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
such risks are determined based upon an ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which includes the identification and assessment of adverse situations that may affect borrowers debt servicing ability  an analysis of overall portfolio quality and prior loan loss experience as well as an appraisal of current and expected economic trends and conditions 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management deems adequate to provide for potential losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in the corporation s continued efforts to resolve and collect problem loans  including nonaccrual and restructured loans have and should continue to favorably impact provision requirements 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   a increase from the level reported at december  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans was in versus in during  the corporation will continue to adjust the provision for loan losses periodically as necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at what is deemed to be an adequate level  based on the previously discussed criteria 
as the provision is primarily a function of credit quality  changes in the provision for loan losses are contingent upon the economic conditions of the corporation s market area and the economic prospects of borrowers 
other income 
other income increased million during to million 
this increase was largely attributable to growth in the corporation s operating lease portfolio during as a result  the net rental income from operating leases increased million during the year 
in addition  the corporation modified its deposit fee schedule at the beginning of the year  resulting in a million increase in service charges on deposits 
between and  other income decreased million to million 
this significant decline is the result of a nonrecurring pretax gain of million recognized on the sale of a former subsidiary s deposits and certain assets during the third quarter of this decrease was partially offset by net rental income from operating leases which grew million during the year 
other expenses 
other expenses increased million during to million 
the primary reason for the increase was expenses associated with stock appreciation rights sars which increased million during the year 
sars are similar to stock options  but  unlike stock options  accounting for sars requires an increase in operating expenses as the stock price increases above the exercise price 
the sar expense in resulted from a rise in the stock price during the comparability between periods of certain expense line items has been affected by the strategic technology alliance entered into on march   between wsfs and alltel  the company which has been managing wsfs data processing for eight years 
under the new five year agreement  alltel will also employ certain on site back office personnel as well as manage deposit and loan operation functions 
as a result  certain costs  most of which previously would have been classified as salaries  are now classified as outsourced operations 
other expenses decreased million between and to million 
the majority of this decrease occurred in salaries which declined million during this decline resulted from sar expenses  which were million below levels  as well as from lower staffing levels 
also  the net costs of foreclosed assets declined million between and this decrease was largely attributable to a million reduction in the provision for losses on foreclosed assets as a result of improved asset quality 
in addition  fdic premiums decreased million between and premiums in and represent only the amount assessed on deposits acquired from saif insured institutions 
income taxes 
the corporation recorded a million tax provision for the year ended december  compared to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  and a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the provision benefit for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the net tax benefit recorded in was a result of the utilization of the corporation s prior net operating loss carryforwards 
the years and included million and million in tax benefits  respectively  resulting from the merger of a former subsidiary into wsfs 
as a result of this merger  certain tax benefits  which were previously offset by a valuation allowance  are now recognizable based upon the continued profitability of the wsfs consolidated group 
approximately million of the corporation s deferred tax assets at december  are related to write downs and income on reverse mortgages attributable to a former subsidiary  providential 
management has continued to assess substantial valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets due to limitations imposed by the code and uncertainties  including the timing of when these assets are realized 
as historical data accumulate  management will have more information on which to base the possible recognition of these assets 
the corporation analyzes its projections of taxable income on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its provision benefit for income taxes accordingly 
for additional information regarding the corporation s tax provision and net operating loss carryforwards  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition consolidated assets grew million  or  during asset growth occurred primarily in vehicles under operating lease  investments and other liquidity  offset in part by reductions in mortgage backed securities 
total liabilities increased million during the year to fund this activity 
this increase occurred primarily in advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
stockholders equity grew million to million at december  this increase was attributable to earnings  offset in part by the acquisition of treasury stock 
investments 
investment securities grew million between december  and this increase resulted primarily from increases of million in notes of the federal home loan bank  million in us treasury notes  and million in notes from the student loan marketing association slma 
mortgage backed securities 
during  mortgage backed securities decreased by million 
the majority of this decline resulted from million in principal repayments during the year 
in addition  the corporation sold a million investment in gnma adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
these decreases were offset in part by the purchase of million in collateralized mortgage obligations 
loans 
net loans declined million to million at december  direct finance leases  which are shown under the heading of loans  decreased million between december  and these leases were replaced by the origination of operating leases during which are shown separately on the balance sheet 
in addition  commercial real estate loans decreased million 
these declines were partially offset by growth in commercial and consumer loans of million and million  respectively 
vehicles under operating leases 
vehicles under operating leases grew million to million at december   primarily as a result of originations in deposits 
deposits increased million during to million 
this growth was largely attributable to the interest credited to deposits of million 
partially offsetting this increase was an outflow of million in deposits 
the table below depicts the changes in net deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows outflows  net deposit acquired sold  net ending balance borrowings 
total borrowings increased million during approximately million in fhlb advances and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase were added during the year to fund asset growth 
stockholders equity 
during the year  stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase included million in net income offset in part by the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock for million 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and met the regulatory classification of a well capitalized institution 
tangible  core  tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios were   and  respectively 
asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the corporation is to manage and control its interest rate risk  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the corporation to accomplish this objective 
the development of the corporation s portfolio of adjustable rate consumer loans in its primary market area has been one of the tactics utilized 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of the corporation s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table 
less than one to over one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans     mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment in reverse mortgages     investment securities     other investments   interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits     fhlb advances    senior notes   other borrowed funds    excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap     interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage loans 
includes principal related cash flows of the operating lease portfolio  which are interest rate sensitive 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the corporation  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of the bank s deposit accounts  that of money market and interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are typically subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the yields on interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities as shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis under the asset liability management caption 
another measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
 interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the chart below is the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
change in change in change in interest rate net interest net portfolio basis points income value this column represents the percentage difference between net interest income for the succeeding months in a stable interest rate environment and net interest income as projected by the various rate scenarios 
this column represents the percentage difference between net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected in the various rate scenarios 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective and  therefore  has focused its efforts on increasing the company s yield cost spread through wholesale and retail opportunities 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure can negatively affect the corporation s results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the corporation s nonperforming assets  restructured loans and past due loans and leases at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans nonperforming leases commercial    consumer commercial mortgages      residential mortgages      construction     total nonaccruing loans nonperforming leases      nonperforming investments in real estate     assets acquired through foreclosure      total nonperforming assets      restructured loans      past due loans leases residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages   consumer total past due loans leases     ratio of nonaccruing loans nonperforming leases to total loans leases 
ratio of allowance for loan lease losses to total gross loans leases ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets 
ratio of loan lease loss allowance to nonaccruing loans leases ratio of loan lease and foreclosed asset allowance to total nonperforming assets total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets decreased by million between and and by million between and in  million in collections of such assets  as well as million in transfers to accrual restructured status contributed to the reduction in nonperforming assets 
such decreases were offset by the addition of million of assets that were not previously classified as nonperforming assets 
the decrease in the levels of nonperforming assets since reflects management s continued efforts to identify and resolve problem assets  and the effects of an improved economy 
an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three fiscal years is presented below 
year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual restructured status    transfers to investment in real estate  charge offs write downs  ending balance    the level of nonaccruing loans and the nonperforming leases to total loans leases ratio decreased from in to 
in the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio decreased from in to 
in the significant reduction in nonaccruing loans and nonperforming assets and  to a lesser extent  the increase in total loans leases and assets  resulted in the improved ratios 
in  nonaccruing loan reductions of million in the construction loan category and a million decrease in assets acquired through foreclosure accounted for the majority of the decrease in total nonperforming assets 
during the second quarter of  a million asset acquired through foreclosure was sold 
during the second and third quarters of  a million loan was transferred to nonaccruing status and subsequently transferred to assets acquired through foreclosure and then sold 
no gain or loss was recorded on either sale 
allowance for loan lease losses 
the corporation maintains allowances for losses and charges losses to these allowances when such losses are considered probable 
the allowances for losses are maintained at a level which management considers adequate to provide for potential losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolios 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolios  which include factors such as identification of adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  a review of overall portfolio quality  prior loss experience and an assessment of current and expected economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions and economic prospects of debtors can occur quickly  and as a result  impact the estimates made by management 
additionally  each quarter  management evaluates the collectibility of each loan and lease in the nonperforming portfolio and the fair value of each asset in the assets acquired through foreclosure category 
the most frequent forms of collateral for loans and foreclosed assets are income producing properties  business owned real estate and personal residences 
the value of such collateral is frequently verified through the use of outside appraisals 
appraisals of collateral  together with the value of guarantees and the worth of other collateral  are combined to recognize current losses  write downs of foreclosed assets  and to reserve for potential future losses

year ended december  beginning balance provision for losses on vehicles under operating leases reclass to allowance for lease losses to vehicles under operating lease transfer from lease residual reserve charge offs recoveries net charge offs ending balance  operating type lease activity began in the provision for loan losses decreased  between and this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in loans and a general improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the provision for losses on vehicles under operating leases increased  between and this increase reflects the growth in operating leases and the increase in net charge offs 
the higher level of loan charge offs in and was due to the deterioration in the credit quality of certain commercial and commercial real estate loans 
during  the most significant charge off in the commercial real estate category was a million partial charge off of a nonaccruing commercial mortgage loan which was subsequently transferred to assets acquired through foreclosure 
the provision for loan losses during was increased primarily due to a million commercial real estate loan being placed on nonaccrual in the first quarter of when the borrower filed bankruptcy 
net charge offs have declined substantially since and have stabilized for the three years ended december  the allowance for losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure  however  such allocations are not indicative of where future losses may occur

liquidity the corporation itself engages only in limited business operations independent of the bank and its subsidiaries and  therefore  does not require a substantial amount of liquid assets 
the corporation is required  however  to maintain a reserve at december  of of the aggregate interest expense for full calendar months on million of the senior notes issued in december at december   the corporation retained approximately million for the purpose of meeting this reserve requirement 
the corporation s ability to comply with this requirement is dependent upon its ability to obtain dividends from the bank 
the corporation s principal asset is its investment in the capital stock of the bank and its primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
under applicable federal regulations  the bank may pay dividends within certain limits and only after notice to the office of thrift supervision ots 
as required by the ots  institutions under its supervision must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of cash and qualified assets to net withdrawable deposits and borrowings due within one year 
the liquidity ratios of the bank were and at december  and  respectively 
management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
it is the policy of the bank to maintain cash and investments at least slightly above required levels 
the corporation s primary financing sources are deposits  repayments of loans and investment securities  sales of loans and borrowings 
in addition  the corporation s liquidity requirements can be accomplished through the use of its borrowing capacity from the fhlb of pittsburgh  the sale of certain securities and the pledging of certain loans for other lines of credit 
management believes these sources are sufficient to maintain the required and prudent levels of liquidity 
at december  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb advances of and million  respectively 
another available short term funding source is a million revolving line of credit with another institution  of which no balance was outstanding at december  the corporation routinely enters into commitments requiring the future outlay of funds 
effective march   the bank entered into a new agreement with its data processing facilities management company 
under the terms of this agreement  an average minimum payment of approximately million has been committed for each of the next four years 
the above commitment  as well as loan commitments  are expected to be met through traditional funding sources  such as deposits  short term borrowings  advances from the fhlb and principal repayments on loans 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of and million  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional borrowings from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as the repayment of other borrowings  and a net increase in assets leased to others 
in  operating and financing activities provided million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the funds provided by financing activities reflect additional fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these funds were utilized to fund the purchase of mortgage backed securities and for the repayment of other borrowings 
during  the financing and operating activities provided million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the funds provided by financing activities reflect the additional fhlb advances and a net increase in certificates of deposit and time deposits 
these funds were used to fund the sale of deposits and for the repayment of other borrowings 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as the bank to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   the bank is classified as well capitalized and is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
management anticipates that the bank will continue to be classified as well capitalized 
for additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital compliance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the corporation initiated the first of three stock repurchase plans approved by the board of directors 
in the second and third quarters of   shares  or approximately of the common stock outstanding  were acquired in open market transactions for million 
in october of  the corporation began a second stock repurchase program to acquire up to of the outstanding common stock through open market repurchases and privately negotiated transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation repurchased  shares  or of common stock outstanding for approximately million 
at december   the corporation held  shares of common stock in its treasury at a cost of million 
in  the corporation substantially completed the second stock repurchase program by acquiring  additional shares of common stock in january for million 
during the second quarter of  the corporation started a third stock repurchase plan to acquire up to of common stock outstanding 
under this third plan  the corporation has purchased  shares at a cost of million 
at december   the corporation held  shares of its treasury stock at a cost of million 
subsequent to december   the corporation reissued  shares of treasury stock as part of compensation for the board of directors 
impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
accounting developments in march the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 earnings per share eps 
this statement  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 simplifies the standards for computing eps and makes them comparable to international standards 
sfas no 
replaces the primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic eps is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock  or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the company 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to apb opinion no 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for the periods ending december   and retroactive restatement of prior period results is required 
accordingly  all eps information contained in this annual report has been restated to comply with this new standard 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure 
sfas no 
 which is applicable to all companies  consolidates the existing guidance in the authoritative literature on an entity s capital structure 
sfas no 
requires disclosures that include the liquidation preferences of preferred stock  information about the pertinent rights and privileges of the outstanding equity securities  and the redemption amounts of capital stock that are redeemable at fixed or determinable prices on fixed or determinable dates 
this statement is effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  since the company currently has a simple capital structure  this statement has had little effect on disclosure requirements for the corporation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
according to the statement  all items of comprehensive income are to be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources 
along with net income  examples of comprehensive income include foreign currency translation adjustments  unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  changes in the market value of a futures contract that qualifies as a hedge of an asset reported at fair value  and minimum pension liability adjustments 
currently  the comprehensive income of the corporation would consist primarily of net income and unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in june  the fasb adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement  which supersedes sfas no 
 requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments on both an annual and interim basis 
sfas no 
mandates disclosure of a measure of segment profit loss  certain revenue and expense items and segment assets 
in addition  the statement requires reporting information on the entity s products and services  countries in which the entity earns revenues and holds assets  and major customers 
this statement requires changes in disclosures only and would not affect the financial condition or operating results of the corporation 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
this statement revises employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
it standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits to the extent practicable  requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis  and eliminates certain disclosures that are no longer as useful as they were when fasb statements no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  were issued 
this statement requires changes in disclosures and would not affect the financial condition or operating results of the corporation 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  year issues year issues result from the inability of many computer programs or computerized equipment to accurately calculate  store or use a date after december  the erroneous date can be interpreted in a number of different ways  typically  the year is represented as the year correctly identifying the year as a leap year may also be an issue 
these misidentifications could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  track important customer account information  provide convenient access to this information  or engage in normal business operations 
the company has completed an assessment of its core financial and operational software systems and has found them already in compliance  or the necessary steps to bring them into compliance have been identified 
these tasks are scheduled for completion by december the assessment of other less critical software systems and various types of equipment is continuing and should be completed in march the company expects to bring all systems into compliance well before the inevitable transition to year could cause a disruption in business activities supported by them 
the company has initiated formal communication with its significant suppliers  business partners and customers 
this communication is intended to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to correct their own year issues 
procedures have been put in place to monitor third parties efforts directed toward correcting year issues 
steps have been defined to help mitigate the effects of a third party s failure to address year issues adequately 
the company has not identified any exposure to contingencies related to the year issue but will continue to evaluate for potential exposure 
the company will use both internal and external resources to complete tasks and perform testing necessary to address year issues 
while addressing and correcting year issues will require substantial effort  a large portion of the costs related to this issue will be met from existing resources through a reprioritization of the technology department initiatives with the remainder representing incremental costs which are not expected to be material 
the company plans to complete the year corrections to its core financial and operational software systems by december  with a full year of integration testing scheduled for completion of the year project is based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
forward looking statements in our annual report  we have included certain forward looking statements concerning the future operations of the corporation 
it is management s desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this statement is for the express purpose of availing the corporation of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements contained in our annual report 
we have used forward looking statements to describe the future plans and strategies including our expectations of the corporation s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans and strategy is inherently uncertain 
factors that could affect results include interest rate trends  competition  the general economic climate in delaware  the mid atlantic region and the country as a whole  loan delinquency rates  and changes in federal and state regulation 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements
