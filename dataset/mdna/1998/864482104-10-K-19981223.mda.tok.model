item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical and pro forma financial condition and results of operations of the partnership and the predecessor company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
since the operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of the assets  revenues and earnings of the partnership  a separate discussion of the partnership s results of operations from other sources is not presented 
general the partnership is engaged in the retail  wholesale marketing and trading of propane and related sales of appliances and services 
the partnership believes it is the third largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  serving more than  active residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers from more than customer service centers in over states 
the partnership s annual retail propane sales volume were approximately million  million and million gallons during the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased on the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to storage tanks located on the customers premises 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  clothes drying and cooking purposes 
industrial customers primarily use propane as a motor fuel burned in internal combustion engines that power over the road vehicles  forklifts and stationary engines  to fire furnaces  as a cutting gas and in other process applications 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for tobacco curing  crop drying  poultry brooding and weed control 
in its wholesale operations  the partnership sells propane principally to large industrial end users and other propane distributors 
product costs the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales prices and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many customers of the partnership rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather which can vary substantially from year to year 
selected quarterly financial data in thousands due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and second quarter revenues  gross profit and earnings are consistently greater than the comparable third and fourth quarter results 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended september  fiscal year ended september  unaudited in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      net income loss      ebitda     retail gallons sold      fiscal year ended september  unaudited in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      net income loss      ebitda      retail gallons sold      results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to lower product costs which resulted in lower selling prices and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in retail gallons sold 
overall  higher nationwide inventories of propane  coupled with warmer than normal temperatures during the winter of fiscal  resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of propane when compared to the winter of fiscal temperatures during fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal  as reported by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  which is attributable to the el nino weather phenomenon 
temperatures during january and february of the fiscal heating season were the warmest on record according to the noaa which began keeping records over years ago 
retail gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons in fiscal as compared to million gallons in the prior year 
wholesale gallons and gallons sold for hedging purposes increased or million gallons to million gallons resulting from the partnership s expansion of its product procurement and price risk management activities 
the decline in retail gallons sold is principally attributable to warmer temperatures principally during the winter heating season in all areas of the partnership s operations 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase principally resulted from overall higher average propane unit margins and the expansion of the partnership s product procurement and price risk management activities  including hedging transactions  partially offset by reduced volume of retail propane gallons sold 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the continued favorable impact of restructuring activities undertaken during  principally lower payroll and benefit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million write off of certain impaired information systems assets  an increase in professional consulting services  primarily in the information systems area  and a million charge related to insurance claims for which insurance coverage was denied 
operating income and ebitda 
results for the fiscal year include a million gain from the sale of an investment in the dixie pipeline co 
and a million write off of certain impaired assets 
results for the prior year period include a restructuring charge of million 
excluding these one time items from both periods  operating income increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
ebitda  excluding the one time items from both periods  increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
the improvement in operating income and ebitda is primarily attributable to higher overall gross profit and lower operating expenses partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity on ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease is attributable to higher interest income on significantly increased cash investments in fiscal resulting from higher net income  proceeds from the sale of the partnership s investment in the dixie pipeline co 
and  to a lesser extent  improved working capital management and lower product costs 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the partnership acquired the propane business and assets of the predecessor company on march  solely for purposes of comparing the results of operations of the partnership for the year ended september  with those of the partnership and the predecessor company for the prior year period  the statement of operations data for the year ended september  is comprised of the combined statements of operations of the predecessor company for the period october  to march  and of the partnership for the period march  to september  revenues 
revenues increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to higher average retail and wholesale selling prices resulting from higher propane product costs 
retail gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in the prior year  while wholesale gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in gallons sold is primarily due to warmer temperatures during the winter heating season in all areas of the partnership s operations 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase principally resulted from higher average retail propane unit margins partially offset by reduced volumes of propane sold 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was due to higher payroll  bad debt and equipment and vehicle leasing costs 
restructuring charges 
fiscal results reflect a restructuring charge of million compared to a million restructuring charge in fiscal in fiscal  after evaluating certain long term cost reduction strategies and organizational changes  the partnership reorganized its product procurement and logistics group  redesigned its fleet and maintenance  field and corporate office organizations  and identified facilities to be closed and impaired assets whose carrying amounts would not be recovered 
in connection with this effort  the partnership recorded a million restructuring charge  comprised of severance  employee benefit and facility closure costs of million  and an impaired asset charge of million 
in fiscal  the partnership reorganized its corporate office and terminated certain employees 
as a result of this action  the partnership recorded a million restructuring charge  comprised of severance and employee benefit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including the management fee charged to the predecessor company and excluding restructuring charges  increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was principally due to higher expenditures for professional consulting services primarily information systems and expansion of customer satisfaction programs 
operating income and ebitda 
operating income  excluding the restructuring charges  decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
ebitda  excluding the restructuring charges  decreased or to million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to higher operating  selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher overall retail margins 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is principally due to the issuance of million in senior notes in connection with the partnership s initial public offering in march risk management the partnership engages in hedging transactions to reduce the effect of price volatility on its product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
the partnership is currently a party to propane futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange and enters into agreements to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
these activities are monitored by management through enforcement of the partnership s commodity trading policy 
hedging does not always result in increased product margins and the partnership does not consider hedging activities to be material to operations or liquidity for the years ended september  and september  for additional information  see item a of this report 
liquidity and capital resources due to the seasonal nature of the propane business  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in net income  exclusive of non cash items  of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect decreases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and accounts payable of million principally due to the lower cost of propane 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued employment and benefit costs of million reflecting higher performance related payroll accruals and an increase in deferred credits and other non current liabilities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations and million of payments for acquisitions  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment and million from the sale of the investment in the dixie pipeline co 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  consisting of capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations and acquisition payments of million  offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
the decrease in cash used for capital expenditures of million in fiscal  when compared to the prior year  is primarily due to reductions in new customer equipment purchases and new vehicle purchases  as the partnership has elected to lease new vehicles rather than purchase new vehicles 
for fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or to million compared to million for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities during fiscal reflects increases in cash from accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other current assets of million and inventories of million principally due to lower sales volumes and a resulting decline in propane purchases 
these increases were offset by an aggregate decrease in accounts payable  accrued interest and accrued employment and benefit costs of million and million of cash expenditures incurred in connection with the partnership s restructuring 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year  reflecting million in capital expenditures and million of payments for acquisitions offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
in march  the operating partnership issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an interest rate of 
the senior notes mature june  the senior note agreement requires that the principal be paid in equal annual payments of million starting june  the partnership has available a million acquisition facility and a million working capital facility 
borrowings under the bank credit facilities bear interest at a rate based upon either libor plus a margin  first union national bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual fee ranging from 
to 
based upon certain financial tests is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
the bank credit facilities  which expire on september   are unsecured on an equal and ratable basis with the operating partnership s obligations under the senior notes 
at september  and september   there were no amounts outstanding under the bank credit facilities 
the senior note agreement and the bank credit facilities contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership  include a maintenance of certain financial tests  b restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and c restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
the operating partnership was in compliance with all covenants and terms as of september  as a result of lower than anticipated earnings for fiscal and the costs associated with the restructuring efforts  the partnership utilized million of cash proceeds available under the distribution support agreement between the partnership and the general partner in connection with the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units with respect to the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the partnership did not utilize proceeds available under the distribution support agreement with respect to the funding of the minimum quarterly distributions for fiscal the distribution support agreement provides for a maximum of approximately million in cash in return for apus million of which has been utilized to support the partnership s minimum quarterly distributions to holders of common units through march  the partnership has not made a distribution on its subordinated units since the first fiscal quarter of and does not intend to make a distribution to the subordinated unitholder prior to consummation of the proposed recapitalization 
the partnership will make distributions in an amount equal to all of its available cash approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
the partnership has made distributions to holders of its common units for each of the quarters in fiscal the partnership s anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million for the repair and replacement of property  plant and equipment and approximately million of interest payments on the senior notes 
in addition  the partnership intends to pay approximately million in minimum quarterly distributions to its common unitholders and in distributions to its general partner during fiscal based on its current cash position  available bank credit facilities and expected cash from operating activities  the partnership expects to have sufficient funds to meet these obligations for fiscal  as well as all of its current obligations and working capital needs during fiscal in connection with the proposed recapitalization  the operating partnership has obtained a commitment letter dated october  from the bank of new york providing for a new bank credit facility allowing for borrowings of up to million 
the recapitalization will be funded by borrowings under this facility as well as internally generated funds 
pursuant to the terms of the commitment letter  borrowings under this facility will bear interest at a rate based upon libor plus a margin or the bank of new york s prime rate plus a margin 
the facility will mature upon the earlier of a five years from the date of closing and b march  if on or before march   the senior notes have not been amended to provide that no principal payments are due thereunder prior to june  the partnership and all present and future domestic subsidiaries of the operating partnership will guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the facility  provided  however  that the service company will not be required to guarantee the facility for so long as its ebitda does not exceed certain levels 
the facility will be secured by certain owned and later acquired assets of the partnership  the operating partnership and its subsidiary guarantors and will rank equally with the operating partnership s obligations under the senior notes 
readiness for year the following disclosure is being made pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act of many information technology it and non information technology non it systems in use throughout the world today may not be able to properly interpret date related data from the year into the year the yk issue 
as a result  the yk issue could have adverse consequences upon the operations and information processing of many companies  including the partnership 
in the second half of  the partnership began to identify the yk exposure of its it systems by focusing upon those systems and applications it considered critical to its ability to operate its business  supply propane to its customers  and accurately account for those services 
the critical systems identified were the retail sales  the human resources payroll and the general ledger financial accounting systems 
based upon the reasonable assurances of the software developers and vendors  the partnership believes that it has replaced the human resources payroll and the general ledger financial accounting systems with yk compliant versions 
in addition  the partnership has retained the services of a third party vendor to assist in the remediation of its retail sales system  as well as the majority of the programs supporting this system 
the partnership anticipates that these critical systems will be yk compliant 
the partnership has also developed and is currently implementing a comprehensive yk project plan to identify and address both its non critical it and non it systems that could potentially be impacted by yk 
in conjunction with this plan and in an effort to improve its business efficiency  the partnership made the decision to replace all its computer hardware and pc based computer software  as well as to migrate the majority of its network based software to a server environment 
according to the reasonable representations of the manufacturers  software developers and vendors  all of the newly purchased it hardware and pc software are functionally yk compliant with some minor issues outstanding 
the partnership is in the process of assessing the non it systems utilized by its field locations to determine the yk compliance of those systems 
with limited exceptions which are being addressed  the safety related devices at the partnership s field locations do not incorporate electronic components and  as such  do not require yk remediation 
the partnership does not believe that the failure of any of its non it systems at any field location would have a material adverse impact upon it 
as of december   the partnership has incurred approximately million to address its yk issues 
it is currently estimated that the partnership will spend between and million to complete its yk compliance program 
this figure does not include the amounts spent to upgrade and replace computer hardware and pc based software 
the partnership does not view the foregoing costs as having a material impact upon its overall financial position and has not delayed or eliminated any other scheduled computer upgrades or replacements due to the yk compliance project 
in addition to testing the individual systems  the partnership anticipates conducting an overall it system yk compliance test by may the partnership is developing a formal yk contingency plan that is to be in place prior to june   which will be based upon its overall disaster recovery plan 
at this time  the partnership anticipates that its yk contingency plan will be based upon manual processes and procedures 
while propane itself is not date dependent  the supply  transportation and consumption of propane is dependent upon third parties  beyond the control of the partnership  which may have systems potentially impacted by the yk issue 
the partnership has contacted the vendors suppliers identified as being significant to its business and is currently reviewing the responses it has received  if any  to evaluate whether these third parties are or will be yk compliant in a timely manner 
the partnership believes that by obtaining these responses  it will be able to minimize any potential business interruption arising out of yk s impact upon these vendors suppliers 
further  although the yk failure of any one customer will not have a materially adverse effect upon the partnership  if a significant percentage of either its customers and or vendors suppliers fail in achieving yk compliance  the yk issue may have an adverse material impact upon the partnership s operations 
although the partnership currently anticipates that its internal mission critical it and non it systems will be yk compliant  it has taken steps to identify and mitigate yk compliance issues with its vendors suppliers and customers and has begun to work on a yk contingency plan  the failure of a mission critical it or non it system or the combined failure of vendors suppliers and or customers to achieve yk compliance could have a material adverse impact on the partnership s operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the partnership was party to propane forward contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
such contracts provide that the partnership sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into for purposes other than trading in anticipation of market movements  and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk the partnership is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures contracts traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
credit risk futures contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and as a result have minimal credit risk 
the partnership is subject to credit risk with forward contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
the partnership evaluates the financial condition of each counterparty with which it conducts business and establishes credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate the exposure of unfavorable market price movements  a sensitivity analysis of open positions as of september  was performed 
based on this analysis  hypothetical and adverse changes in market prices for each of the future months for which a future and or forward contract exists indicate potential losses in future earnings of million and million  respectively  as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of december   the posted price of propane at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon at september   representing a decline 
such decline is attributable to factors including warmer weather patterns  high national propane inventory levels and decreases in the market price of crude oil
