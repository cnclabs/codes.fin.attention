item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the business leasing solutions  inc the company is in the business of leasing information processing and communications equipment to large  creditworthy customers  primarily through vendor programs and strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers  value added resellers and systems integrators 
the company s focus is on operating leases because such leases provide the opportunity for the company to realize the full benefit of residuals received upon remarketing the equipment to the original customer at the end of the initial lease term 
to date  the company has purchased approximately billion of equipment 
beginning in and continuing into  the company expanded its operations to western europe and canada through acquisitions of existing leasing companies 
lease accounting since  the company has principally engaged in two types of lease transactions which  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  are classified as operating leases or direct finance leases 
the allocation of income among accounting periods within a lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification  as described below 
direct finance leases 
direct finance leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee 
a lease is a direct finance lease if the collectibility of lease payments is reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the lessee by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair value of the leased equipment at inception of the lease 
direct finance leases are recorded as investment in direct finance leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the inception of the lease  unearned lease income represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as earned lease income over the lease term 
operating leases 
all lease contracts which do not meet the criteria of direct finance leases are accounted for as operating leases 
monthly lease payments are recorded as operating lease revenues 
leased equipment is recorded  at the company s cost  as investment in operating leases and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the estimated residual value at the expiration of the lease term 
the residual value of an item of leased equipment is its fair market value at the expiration of the lease 
residual values are estimated at the inception of the lease and reviewed quarterly over the term of the lease 
estimated residual values of leased equipment may be adjusted downward  if necessary 
decreases in estimated residual values are made as the change in residual value becomes apparent  and are reflected over the remaining term of the lease by increased depreciation expense for operating leases or by decreased earned lease income for direct finance leases 
when equipment is sold  the net proceeds realized in excess of the estimated residual value are generally recorded as a operating lease revenue  or the amount by which the estimated residual value exceeds the net proceeds is recorded as a loss 
see business leasing and sales activities remarketing 
when equipment is re leased  the company continues to depreciate the equipment in accordance with the company s then current estimate of its residual value  and the monthly lease payments are recorded as revenue when billed 
substantially all of the leases which the company enters into are noncancelable transactions under which the obligor must make all scheduled payments  maintain the equipment  accept the risk of loss of such equipment and pay all equipment related taxes

the financing necessary to support the company s leasing activities has principally been provided from nonrecourse and recourse borrowings 
historically  the company has obtained recourse and nonrecourse borrowings from money center banks  regional banks  insurance companies  finance companies and financial intermediaries 
prior to the permanent financing of its leases  interim financing has been obtained through short term  secured  recourse facilities

the proceeds of borrowings under this line may be used only to fund certain accounts payable to two of the company s vendors resulting from the purchase of equipment for lease to specified significant customers of the company 
the agreements for the facilities described above contain covenants regarding leverage  interest coverage  minimum net worth and profitability and a limitation on the payment of dividends

the transaction generated proceeds of  a portion of which 
were used to repay certain subordinated debt of the company  which was owed to the same financing source 
occasionally  the company will obtain long term  nonrecourse financing for individual significant lease transactions at the time or shortly after it purchases the related equipment 
an aggregate of   of which is recourse  with a weighted average interest rate of per annum  remained outstanding under all such arrangements as of december  the company s debt financing activities typically provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment purchased by the company for lease to its customers 
the to balance of the purchase price the company s equity investment in equipment must generally be financed by cash flow from its operations  recourse debt  or common stock or convertible debt sold by the company 
debt financing for all or a portion of the company s equity investment is not readily available in the marketplace and may require an interest rate materially higher than is required by the company s conventional debt financing 
although the company expects that the credit quality of its lessees and its residual return history will continue to allow it to obtain such financing  no assurances can be given that such financing will be available  at acceptable terms or at all 
borrowings under the above described facilities or transactions are generally secured by the lease receivables financed under such arrangements and the related equipment 
payments under the company s borrowings and the maturities of its long term borrowings are typically structured to match the payments due under the leases securing the borrowings 
the company s current lines of credit  if renewed or replaced  its expected access to the public and private securities markets  both debt and equity  anticipated new lines of credit both short term and long term and recourse and nonrecourse  anticipated long term financing of individual significant lease transactions  and its estimated cash flow from operations are anticipated to provide adequate capital to fund the company s operations  including acquisitions and financings under its vendor programs  for the next twelve months 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to be able to renew or timely replace its existing and recently expired lines of credit  to continue to have access to the public and private securities markets  both debt and equity  and to be able to enter into new lines of credit and individual financing transactions 
however  no assurances can be given as to the rates that the company may be required to pay under any of such financing arrangements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future quarterly operating results and the market price of its stock may fluctuate 
in the event the company s revenues or earnings for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market in general  such shortfall could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on the market price of the company s stock 
any such adverse impact could be greater if any such shortfall occurs near the time of any material decrease in any widely followed stock index or in the market price of the stock of one or more public equipment leasing companies or major customers or vendors of the company 
the company s quarterly results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  as a result of sales by the company of equipment it has leased to its customers or of sales of the lease receivables under the leases with its customers 
such sales of equipment or lease receivables  which are an ordinary but not predictable part of the company s business  will have the effect of increasing revenues  and  to the extent sales proceeds exceed net book value  net income  during the quarter in which the sale occurs 
furthermore  any such sale may result in the reduction of revenue  and net income  otherwise expected in subsequent quarters  as the company will not receive lease revenue from the sold equipment in those quarters 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that comparisons of the results of its operations to immediately succeeding quarters are not necessarily meaningful and that such results for one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
year as the year approaches  a critical issue has emerged for all companies  including the company  with respect to whether application software programs and operating systems utilized by a company and the companies with which it does business can accommodate this date value 
in brief  many software products in the marketplace only accommodate a two digit date position which represents the year eg  is stored on the system and represents the year 
as a result  the year ie  could be the maximum date value these products would be able to process accurately 
the company has  for several months  been engaged in a review of the software and systems it uses in an effort to determine whether it or its operations may be materially adversely affected by this so called year conversion 
in that review  the company has identified certain software applications as being critical applications used in daily operations 
such applications include lease management  accounting and financial reporting systems  as well as spreadsheet programs 
the company has inquired of  and generally obtained the assurances of  the providers of such software with respect to it being year compliant 
based on its review  the company does not presently believe that year compliance issues with respect to its software and systems will materially adversely affect the company or its operations 
however  no assurances can be given that such review uncovered every potential adverse effect of the year conversion in connection with any of such software or systems 
the company has only recently commenced a review of whether the software and systems of the vendors  financing sources  customers  equipment manufacturers or distributors or other parties with which it deals may  as a result of the year conversion  have a material adverse effect on the company or its operations 
accordingly  it is too early for the company to be able to predict whether such software or systems of such parties may have such effect 
as part of this review  the company will attempt to obtain assurances from each of such parties  whose dealings with the company are material to the company or its operations  that such party does not and will not utilize software or systems that may interface with the company  or are or will be important to the operations of such party  that may cause problems to such party or the company as a result of the year conversion 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to obtain such assurances from each of such parties or that it will be able to obtain the information from such parties necessary for the company to determine whether it may be materially adversely affected by the software or systems of such parties 
the company will maintain an ongoing effort to recognize and evaluate potential exposures relating to the year conversion arising from its use of software supplied by other parties or its dealings with other parties 
at present  the company cannot estimate the total cost to it of recognizing  evaluating and addressing any such exposures
