customs brokerage net revenue increased to million from million reported in the prior year 
the number of united states customs entries filed by the company increased approximately to million from million in the prior year

during the early part of the fiscal year  carrier capacity in certain tradelanes  specifically those which the company had committed capacity  increased at a faster rate than shipping volumes 
that excess capacity resulted in downward pressure on pricing levels and caused lower gross margins 
the fourth quarter reflected an increase in sales volume  coupled with reduced transportation costs 
these combined to overcome the earlier margin decline resulting in the overall margin to be comparable to the prior year 
airfreight forwarding revenue and net revenue increased and  respectively  due to increased numbers of shipments and total chargeable weight of cargo shipped 
the increase in the number of shipments was provided primarily from existing customers 
gross margin decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher transportation costs during the first half of the year which could not be passed to customers 
the fourth quarter reflected a decrease in volume causing a decrease in revenue and net revenue compared to the same period in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in united states export volume resulting from the asian currency crisis and the loss of certain accounts on the basis of price 
overall declines were partially offset by increased volume of business for united states domestic airfreight services which contributes generally higher net revenues as a percentage of gross revenue than international shipments 
warehousing and distribution revenue and net revenue increased and  respectively  due principally to increased demand from existing integrated logistics customers  expansion of overseas and domestic services  expansion of warehouse facilities  and strong latin american  united states and certain european economies

salaries and related costs increased due to growth in the number of personnel 
salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million reported in the prior year

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were compared to  excluding the million charge reported in the prior year 
other income and expense due to the strengthening of the us dollar  realized currency gains increased by

price competition in the company s traditional transportation and brokerage services remained intense all year with resultant downward pressure on prices 
during the year fuel surcharges were placed on the company s airfreight business as a result of increases in fuel cost 
to a great extent  these price increases levied by most carriers were passed to customers 
net revenue increased to million in from million in warehouse and distribution provided an increase of million in net revenue  a gain over the prior year  as the company continued to rapidly expand its logistics and supply chain management businesses 
in percentage terms  this segment has been the fastest growing segment of the business 
customs brokerage provided approximately million growth in net revenue  up versus prior year 
existing customers and expansion of operations along the usa and canadian border accounted for much of the gain 
further growth in customs brokerage was provided from operations in the united kingdom

salaries and related costs increased in by million  a increase from the million incurred during the prior year 
the increase is the result of growth in the number of full time equivalent employees caused by acquisitions  new locations and expanding operations at existing locations 
the increase in salaries and related costs from additional personnel  representing approximately a increase in the number of employees  was partially mitigated by a slight decrease in the average payroll cost per employee 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to expenditures to support the company s expansion  including data processing costs  communications and occupancy related costs which include warehouse related expenses 
the general and administrative expense increase  excluding the million charge for doubtful accounts and salaries and related costs  was million  representing a increase

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this filing that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
year the company conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems affected by year yk and developed an implementation plan to resolve these issues 
this yk plan includes remediation of certain systems  upgrading various systems and replacement of certain other systems 
costs associated with modifying computer software for yk are expensed as incurred 
total costs to upgrade or replace certain company systems for yk are estimated to be approximately million 
actual costs may vary from the estimates as the remediation and testing the company s systems progresses 
the company believes modifications made to existing software and conversion to new software will be completed before operations would be affected by the date designation 
however  if such modifications and conversions fail or miscalculate  yk may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has begun the process of contacting customers  vendors  carriers  government agencies  and other trading partners to ensure their systems and services are yk compliant 
the company receives services from its trading vendor partners in connection with the delivery by the company of products and services to its customers 
although the company is not directly responsible for these trading partners systems  their problems with the yk could materially effect the company s business operations 
currency and other risk factors the company s worldwide operations are transacted in many currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  the company is exposed to inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental regulations 
the company manages these currency exposures through a variety of means such as hedging  conversion of local cash to us dollars  accelerating and decelerating international payments among the company s offices and agents 
the company s translation adjustment and foreign exchange losses for fiscal year increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain currencies of asia  europe and latin america 
in particular  during the second and third quarters of fiscal year  the currencies of many asian countries devalued significantly 
the charge to equity in the currency translation adjustment during was million while net foreign currency gains realized during fiscal year were approximately million 
devaluation of foreign currencies could adversely impact the financial results of operations in future periods 
the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities such as airlines  steamship carriers and governmental agencies 
changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products  and or the international trade and tariff environment could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
management believes the company s business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation in the past 
historically  the company has generally been successful in passing cost increases to its customers by means of price increases 
however  competitive marketplace conditions could impede the ability to pass future cost increases to customers and could erode the company s operating margins 
additional risks and uncertainties include i the company s ability to continue its program to improve operating results and cash flows  ii dependence of the company on international trade resulting from favorable worldwide economic conditions  iii dependence of the company on continued services of key executives and managers  iv risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  including a diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of operations and personnel of acquired companies  b potential adverse short term effects of acquisitions on the company s operating results  and c integration of financial reporting systems and acquired assets 
v the possible inability of the company s information systems to keep pace with the increasing complexity and growth of the company s business and yk issues  vi the increasing level of investment required by the transition of the company from prior predominance of customs brokerage revenue to an increasing emphasis on integrated logistics and providing a full range of international transportation and supply chain management services  vii diversion of management focus and resources as a result of pending litigation  viii other risks disclosed elsewhere in this form k or in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company is continuing its comprehensive review of its pricing structure of its various services and customer credit terms 
the company is also continuing to review its expenses to improve the quality and efficiencies of the company s processes within the operating and supporting departments
