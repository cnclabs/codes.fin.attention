cash flow from operating activities as reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for cash dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the company satisfied its reit requirement of distributing at least of ordinary taxable income for each of the three years ended december   and  accordingly  federal income taxes were not provided in these years 
the company s dividend payout ratio for  and approximated  and  respectively  based on funds from operations for the applicable year 
the company continued to expand its portfolio of income producing properties in this growth resulted primarily from the acquisition of properties  both shopping centers and industrial properties 
during the year  the company purchased eight shopping centers  three industrial projects  and its joint venture partner s interest in four other shopping centers 
these acquisitions added million square feet to the company s portfolio at a combined cost of million 
the company expanded its presence in many of its newer markets  with purchases in dallas fort worth  phoenix  tucson  las vegas  kansas city and colorado springs 
the company completed the development of a 
million square foot build to suit office distribution facility on a tract of the company s undeveloped land and also substantially completed development of two shopping centers which added less than 
million square feet 
additionally  the company has an ongoing program for maintaining and renovating its existing portfolio of properties 
capitalized expenditures for acquisitions  new development and additions to the existing portfolio were  in millions   and during  and  respectively 
all of the acquisitions and new development during were initially financed under the company s revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures in are expected to equal  if not exceed  the total for total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily to fund acquisitions and new development 
the company s ratio of debt to total market capitalization was at december   as compared to at year end during the year  the company issued an additional million in unsecured medium term notes mtns

the shares are callable at the company s option any time after march  and have no stated maturity 
the proceeds of the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility and to retire million of secured notes payable to an insurance company 
the early extinguishment of these notes that were scheduled to mature in august of will result in an extraordinary loss of million in continued growth through acquisitions and new development will eventually necessitate the issuance of additional equity securities  however  the company s current capital structure should allow the issuance of additional debt before this is required 
in the interim  the company will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider its available alternatives  including both public and private placements

the proceeds from the sale were used primarily to retire overnight repurchase agreements which were collateralized by these marketable debt securities 
funds from operations funds from operations is an alternate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in these increases relate primarily to the impact of the company s acquisitions and new developments and  to a lesser degree  the activity at its existing properties

direct costs and expenses of operating the company s properties ie  operating and ad valorem tax expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during these periods

gross interest costs  before capitalization of interest to development projects  increased by million from million in to million in this increase in interest cost was due mainly to the increase in the average debt outstanding from million for to million for the weighted average interest rate decreased slightly from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million from the amount of interest capitalized decreased to

the gain on sale of million in was primarily due to the condemnation of a shopping center by the state of texas during the third quarter 
the company has leased back the portion of the shopping center purchased by the state  and will continue to operate the center 
the gain on sales of property and securities of million in is due primarily to the sale of two properties and the receipt of insurance proceeds from fires which destroyed parts of two shopping centers 
effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in the company has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby the company receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operating results
