item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations paul son provides gaming equipment and supplies to new casinos and consumable products to its existing customer base 
the principal consumable products have limited useful lives  ranging from several hours in the case of playing cards and dice to several months in the case of table game layouts and several years in the case of casino chips and gaming furniture 
core business revenues are generated by sales of these products to the over of the casinos in the united states with which the company has an established relationship and comprise the majority of the company s total revenues 
complementing this core business is the significant additional revenue the company realizes when providing a full range of products to new casinos 
the company strives to become the casino s sole supplier of table game equipment and supplies 
during the past decade  casino entities have expanded from land based resort properties to riverboats  both cruising and dockside  and to native american lands 
as a licensed supplier  the company has vigorously pursued table gaming opportunities in emerging gaming jurisdictions 
because of the company s production capacity and its experience in the gaming supply industry  management believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the combined growth of the gaming industry both domestically and internationally 
while the gaming industry has grown in recent years  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the gaming industry as a whole 
this trend is attributed to an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines which  in certain cases  may reduce the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
the number of new table games in new jurisdictions typically follows this trend after a period of operation 
results of operations the following table summarizes selected items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended may  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense net income loss the following table details the company s historical revenues by product line years ended may  revenues in thousands casino chips    table layouts    playing cards    gaming furniture    dice    table accessories and other products    total    comparison of operations for the years ended may  and may  revenues 
for the fiscal year ended may   paul son s revenues reached a record total of approximately million 
the fiscal revenue figure represents a million  or  increase from the million in revenues which the company generated the previous fiscal year 
the increase in revenues for the period resulted principally from an increase in gaming furniture and accessory sales products not manufactured by the company of approximately million and an increase in playing card sales of approximately million offset  in part  by a decrease in casino chip sales of approximately million 
gaming furniture and accessory sales  which are products purchased from third party suppliers and then sold to the customer  increased principally due to significant orders from certain customers associated with new openings and expansions and increased demand for these products 
playing card sales in fiscal increased nearly from fiscal management believes its ability to meet customers quality expectations  competitive pricing  and its aggressive pursuit of this business segment have contributed to this growth 
offsetting the increase in gaming furniture and playing card sales was a decrease in casino chip sales of approximately  or approximately million 
management believes this decrease was caused by a decline in new casino openings and expansions in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a low demand for casino chips during fiscal since casino chips may be used by casinos for several years  related sales are subject to varying replacement cycles 
sales of other company manufactured products dice and table layouts did not fluctuate significantly between the two fiscal periods 
sales of company manufactured products were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal core sales in fiscal were approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or 
core sales  which are sales of consumable gaming supplies and equipment to the company s existing customer base  decreased during the year primarily due to the aforementioned decline in casino chip sales  offset  in part  by the increase in playing card sales 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of sales  increased to for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this percentage increase was principally caused by three significant factors i the aforementioned change in the mix of products sold from higher margin manufactured products casino chips  cards  dice and layouts to marginally profitable distributed items  such as gaming tables and seating furniture  which caused an approximate million deterioration in gross margins  ii the underabsorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to the low production volume of company manufactured products during  and iii certain cost inefficiencies resulting from the final transition of certain manufacturing processes ie playing cards  layouts  and certain plastic goods from the company s las vegas facility to its mexico facilities 
during certain previous reporting periods  the company has experienced a positive impact from the decrease in the value of the mexican peso 
during the fiscal year ended may   the value of the mexican peso remained relatively stable 
the company cannot predict what impact fluctuations between the mexican peso and the us dollar will have on the future operating results of the company 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased in absolute dollars by approximately million to approximately million as compared to approximately million in the prior fiscal year 
this decline in gross profit was a result of the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of sales from to due to the cost of revenue factors discussed above offset  in part  by slightly higher revenues in the fiscal period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may  increased approximately million  or  to million or of revenues compared to million  or of revenues  in the previous fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to sales office and administrative payroll related expenses an approximate  increase over fiscal from the expansion into new and existing gaming markets  start up costs involved in marketing the company s non gaming products with various customers  increased depreciation and other occupancy costs arising from property and equipment purchases and the opening of retail outlets and newly opened sales offices 
additionally  bad debt expense increased due to an increase in accounts receivable amounts outstanding as compared to the prior year  the separation from a certain company distributor and a reevaluation of the financial condition of certain of the company s significant debtors during fiscal interest expense 
for the year ended may   interest expense increased approximately to  as compared to  in the prior fiscal year  as a result of increased average outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit during fiscal and the acquisition of million of new debt to finance a new building in san luis  mexico and certain equipment acquired in november other income 
in fiscal  other income decreased  or  over the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was attributable principally to a gain before income taxes of approximately  which resulted from the sale of certain real estate in fiscal net income loss 
for the year ended may   the company incurred a net loss of approximately million  a decrease of million from the net income of million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned decreases in gross profit  other income  and increases to sg a expenses from the period  offset  in part  by a slight increase in revenues over the prior fiscal year 
basic net loss per share was 
for the year ended may  as compared with basic net income of 
for the year ended may comparison of operations for the years ended may  and may  revenues 
for the fiscal year ended may   paul son s revenues reached a total of approximately million 
this revenue figure represented a million  or  increase from the million in revenues which the company generated the previous year 
the increase in revenues resulted principally from an increase in new casino openings during the year 
in fiscal year  the company sold products totaling million to new casinos including riverboats  land based properties and native american casinos versus million to new casinos in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in new casino revenues was offset by a decrease in core sales 
core sales in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or over core sales of million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in playing card sales  both paper and plastic 
playing card sales were down due to a number of factors including a change in the company s supplier of plastic playing cards during the second quarter of the fiscal year and a slowdown in shipments to many of the company s contract playing card customers who had a temporary over supply of playing cards during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  during fiscal  the company restructured its playing card sales force  developed an improved playing card product and underwent the transition of a portion of its playing card production to san luis  mexico  resulting in a temporary slowdown in playing card sales efforts 
management believes the changes implemented will result in greater sales coverage in all geographic areas  an improved product and more competitive pricing 
as a result of these changes  the company experienced an increase of in paper playing card sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the average of the sales generated in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
to a lesser extent  the company s core sales were affected by a decline in the sales of table accessories  which are generally acquired from third party manufacturers  who have been selling directly to casino customers in competition with the company 
as a result the company began manufacturing its own line of plastic dealing shoes in may in connection with the increase in new casino openings  sales of casino chips  table layouts  and dice increased   and  respectively  while  as a result of the decrease in core sales  playing cards  gaming furniture  and table accessories and other products decreased  and  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the fiscal year ended may  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this percentage decrease was due to a number of factors including higher sales volume and corresponding higher operating efficiencies ie increased sales resulting in a higher number of units produced over the same fixed production costs  although the corresponding higher efficiencies achieved were partially offset by a temporary increase in fixed production costs resulting from the relocation of a portion of the company s playing card production to san luis  mexico 
also contributing to the decrease in the company s cost of revenues percentage was a change in product mix sold during the year 
chip sales  for which the company generates the highest gross margin  were million versus million in the prior fiscal year 
during certain previous reporting periods  the company has experienced a positive impact from the decrease in the value of the mexican peso 
during the fiscal year ended may   the value of the mexican peso remained relatively stable 
the company cannot predict what impact fluctuations will have on future costs of the company s products manufactured in mexico 
gross profit 
gross profit increased in absolute dollars by approximately  to approximately million as compared to million in the prior fiscal year as a result of the higher revenues and a decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of sales from to due to the factors discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may  decreased approximately  or  to million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues in the previous fiscal year 
sg a expense reductions were achieved in almost all categories across the board with few exceptions 
major reductions in sg a expenses included reductions in salaries and wages  outside commissions  advertising and promotion costs  legal and accounting  and travel and entertainment costs 
most reductions were due to the cost cutting and restructuring program initiated by the company during the second quarter of fiscal the most significant increase in sg a expenses was in depreciation and amortization  due to the addition of property and equipment purchased during the previous three fiscal years 
interest expense 
for the year ended may   interest expense decreased approximately to  as compared to  in the prior fiscal year  as a result of the company s efforts to pay down long term debt and fund operations and capital expenditures out of cash generated from operations

in fiscal  other income increased  or  over the previous fiscal year 
in february  the company sold an approximately  square foot building which was part of the original facility for  the company s depreciated cost basis of the building was  resulting in a capital gain of  before income taxes  net of income taxes 
net income loss 
for the year ended may   the company had record net income of approximately million  an increase of million over the net income of  in the prior fiscal year 
this increase in net income was primarily due to increases in revenues  gross profit and other income and decreases in sg a expenses over the prior fiscal year 
basic net income per share was 
for the year ended may  as compared with 
for the year ended may  liquidity and capital resources overview 
management believes that the combination of cash flows from operations  the company s existing line of credit and additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis 
working capital 
working capital totaled approximately million at may   versus approximately million at may  working capital decreased during the year primarily due to the company s net loss before depreciation of approximately million and by the company s cash investment in certain property  plant and equipment during the year 
cash flow 
operating activities used approximately million in cash during the fiscal year ended may  compared to cash provided of approximately million during the prior year 
net loss before depreciation and income taxes of approximately million was the major factor contributing to the cash used in operations

recently issued and adopted accounting standards the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
this standard provides guidance on the financial reporting for start up costs and organization costs and requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   though earlier adoption is encouraged 
management believes that sop will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income in june this statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires a company to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
this is a disclosure item only and will have no impact on reported earnings per share 
the fasb recently issued sfas no

during the fiscal year ending may  this statement establishes additional standards for segment reporting in the financial statements 
this is a disclosure item only and will have no impact on earnings per share

basic net earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss by the average shares outstanding during the respective period

these common share equivalents are options to purchase common stock whose exercise price is less than the average market price 
year project the company is conducting a review of its computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the year issue and is in the process of updating many of its existing systems to improve overall business performance and to accommodate business for the year 
however  given the inherent risks for a project of this magnitude and the resources required  the timing and costs involved could differ materially from that anticipated by the company 
the company expects its year date conversion project to be completed on a timely basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the conversion project will be completed on schedule  and that the systems of other companies on which the company may rely also will be timely converted or that such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse impact on the company s systems 
the estimated costs directly or indirectly associated with the conversion project is currently expected to be less than  a significant portion of which will be in the form of capital expenditures 
as of may   the company has incurred no significant costs which are directly or indirectly related to the year project 
statement on forward looking information certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward looking  such as statements relating to anticipated performance  financing sources and the relocation of certain operations 
any forward looking statement made by the company necessarily is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that  while considered reasonable by the company  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and are subject to change 
actual results of the company s operations may vary materially from any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
forward looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the forward looking statements will be achieved 
undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements 
some of the contingencies and uncertainties to which any forward looking statement contained herein is subject include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on expansion of casino industry 
a significant percentage of the company s revenue is generated by sales relating to casino openings and expansions 
as such  the company s future growth will be dependent to a material degree on the continued emergence and growth of new markets for the company s products  including new casino openings or expansions throughout the united states and other areas of the world 
a reduction in the pace of new casino openings and casino expansions in existing and emerging legalized gaming jurisdictions would have a negative effect on the company s business 
similarly  the restriction or abolishment of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in which the company currently does business would have a negative impact on the company 
gaming regulations 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming equipment and supplies are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
although these regulations vary among jurisdictions  virtually all jurisdictions require licenses  permits and approvals to be held by the company and its key personnel in connection with the manufacture and distribution of some or all of the company s products 
the failure of the company or its key personnel to obtain or retain required licenses  permits or approvals in one or more jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on the company and could adversely affect the ability of the company and its key personnel to obtain or retain licenses in other jurisdictions 
no assurance can be given that such licenses  permits or approvals will be obtained  retained or renewed in the future in existing or emerging jurisdictions 
any beneficial holder of the company s common stock may be subject to investigation by the gaming authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates if such authorities have reason to believe that such ownership may be inconsistent with such state s gaming policies 
persons who acquire beneficial ownership of more than certain designated percentages of common stock will be subject to certain reporting and qualification procedures established by the nevada and other gaming authorities  as well as certain local licensing authorities 
need for tribal state compacts 
the company s ability to generate greater revenues and earnings is dependent in part on the growth of native american tribal casinos 
under igra  the operation of a casino on native american tribal land is not permitted until the native american tribe and the state in which it is located have entered into a tribal state compact authorizing gaming on the tribe s land and such tribal state compact is approved by the secretary of the department of interior 
many states have resisted entering into tribal state compacts  which has resulted in litigation challenging the constitutionality of igra 
if igra were found to be unconstitutional  the procedures that would apply to the initiation and operation of native american tribal casinos would be uncertain 
such a finding could severely limit or delay the expansion of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
in addition  a recent court ruling has placed limits on the ability of native american tribes to force states to enter into tribal state compacts and several states  through legislation or constitutional amendment  have sought to limit the scope of native american gaming under igra 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s financial results are dependent in part upon sales to new or expanding casinos  which may  in turn  be dependent upon the authorization of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
the timing of these events does not follow consistent patterns throughout any given year 
given this uncertain timing and the large dollar value of sales to new casinos  the company s future operating results may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
table games growth rate 
the company s primary products are sold to casinos with table games 
in recent years  there has been an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines  and in certain cases  a resulting reduction in the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
as a result  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the casino industry as a whole 
although the company s sales have grown marginally over the past several years  the company believes that the company s rate of growth would have been greater if not for this trend 
an acceleration of the aforementioned trend of allocating more gaming space to slot machines rather than table games could have a negative impact on the company s rate of growth 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree on the performance of paul s 
endy  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and eric p 
endy  president and director 
the company does not carry key man life insurance for either of these executive officers  and the loss of the services of either of them could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also dependent upon the abilities and efforts of certain other management personnel  particularly in the sales department 
the company s sales department has recently had two successive senior management persons depart  while at the same time experiencing relatively flat sales and larger than historical proportions of sales of lower gross margin products 
management anticipates that as the company continues to expand into new gaming jurisdictions throughout the united states and internationally  its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to fill key sales  administrative and management positions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to locate and retain such individuals 
expansion of international sales 
although currently only a small percentage of the company s sales are to casinos located in foreign countries  a component of the company s business strategy is the expansion of its international sales 
to the extent the company is successful in this endeavor  it will be increasingly subject to the customary risks of doing business in foreign countries 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  competitive issues relative to established businesses with significant current market share and business customer relationships  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments and the possibility of trade embargoes  political instability or war or other hostility  as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
competition 
there are significant competitors in each of the company s major product lines 
with the continuing expansion of gaming  it is possible that new competitors may be attracted to the table game supply business  some of which may be in the business of selling gaming products  have licenses to sell gaming supplies and have greater financial resources than the company 
the entry by such companies into the company s markets could adversely impact the company s business 
control by existing stockholder  antitakeover effects 
paul s 
endy is the beneficial owner of approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
endy effectively controls the election of all of the members of the board of directors of the company and effectively controls virtually all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the company 
such ownership may discourage acquisition of large blocks of the company s securities and could have an anti takeover effect  possibly depressing the price of the common stock 
in addition  nevada corporation law and the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
reliance on suppliers 
for certain of its products  the company is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the company with raw materials for manufacturing and finished goods for distribution 
the failure of one or more of these suppliers to meet the company s performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on the company
