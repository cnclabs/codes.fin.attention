item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
on october  the company exercised it option to acquire the remaining minority interest in hub city new orleans  lp hub new orleans for a nominal sum 
on october   the company also purchased  for  the joint venture interest in hlx company  llc hlx not owned by the company  making hlx a wholly owned subsidiary of hub group 
on march   the company announced that it would acquire the minority interest in hub city rio grande  lp  hub city dallas  lp and hub city houston  lp the company estimates it will acquire the minority interests in april at a cost of approximately million 
after the acquisition  all hubs in texas  as well as mexico  will be wholly owned by the company 
on march   the company announced that it had recently signed a letter of intent to purchase all of the outstanding stock of quality intermodal corporation quality 
the company has offered to pay million in cash and million through the issuance of a three year note  bearing interest at an annual rate of  for all of quality s stock 
quality is an intermodal and truckload brokerage service provider headquartered in houston and with offices in dallas  los angeles  chicago  philadelphia and atlanta 
quality had revenue of approximately million in although there is no guarantee that the acquisition will occur  the company hopes to sign a definitive purchase agreement in the near future 
services provided the company s transportation services can be broadly placed into the following categories intermodal as an imc  the company arranges for the movement of its customers freight in containers and trailers over long distances 
hub group contracts with railroads to provide transportation over the long haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies  known as drayage companies  for pickup and delivery 
in markets where adequate drayage service is not available  the company supplements third party drayage services with company owned drayage operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as part of its intermodal services  the company negotiates rail and drayage rates  electronically tracks shipments in transit  consolidates billing and handles claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of its customers 
the company uses its hub network  connected through its proprietary advanced intermodal management aim system  to access containers and trailers owned by leasing companies  railroads and steamship lines 
because each hub not only handles its own outbound shipments but also handles inbound shipments from other hubs  each hub is able to track trailers and containers entering its service area and use that equipment to fulfill its customers outbound shipping requirements 
this effectively allows the company to capture containers and trailers and keep them within the hub network without having to make a capital investment in transportation equipment 
highway services the company arranges for the transportation of freight by truck  providing customers another option for their transportation needs 
this is accomplished by matching customers needs with carriers capacity to provide the appropriate service and price combination 
the company has contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing it to meet the varied needs of its customers 
the company negotiates rates  tracks shipments in transit  consolidates billing and handles claims for freight loss and damage on behalf of its customers 
the company s brokerage operation also provides customers with specialized programs 
through the dedicated trucking program  certain carriers have informally agreed to move freight for hub s customers on a continuous basis 
this arrangement allows hub to gain control of the trucking equipment to effectively meet its customer s needs without owning the equipment 
through the core carrier plus one program  hub assumes the responsibility for over the road truckload shipments that the customer s core carriers cannot handle 
this service supplements the customer s core carrier program and helps ensure the timely delivery of the customer s freight 
logistics the company has expanded its service capabilities as customers increasingly outsource their transportation needs 
the company currently offers various logistics services  including comprehensive transportation management  arranging for delivery to multiple locations at the shipment s destination  third party warehousing and other customized logistics services  as well as other non traditional logistics services such as installation of point of sale merchandise displays 
when providing complete transportation services  the company essentially replaces the customer s transportation department 
once the company is hired as a single source logistics provider  it negotiates with intermodal  railcar  truckload and less than truckload carriers to move the customer s product through the supply chain and then dispatches the move for the customer 
using its advanced transportation management software  the company consolidates orders into full truckload shipments  chooses a shipping route  electronically tenders loads to carriers and reports the move to the customer 
hub network over the past years  hub group has grown from a single office with two employees into a network of hubs in the united states  one hub in canada and one hub in mexico 
hub group also has several satellite sales offices 
in developing this network  the company has carefully selected each location to ensure coverage in areas with significant concentrations of shipping customers and one or more railheads 
hub group currently has hubs in the following cities atlanta grand rapids milwaukee st 
louis baltimore houston minneapolis salt lake city birmingham indianapolis new orleans san antonio boston jacksonville new york city san francisco chicago kansas city philadelphia seattle cleveland los angeles pittsburgh toledo dallas memphis portland toronto detroit mexico city rochester the entire hub network is interactively connected through the company s aim system 
this enables hub group to move freight into and out of every major city in the united states and most locations in canada and mexico 
the company s hub in new haven was recently closed and its operations transferred to boston 
in connection with the reorganization in texas  the company anticipates that the hub in san antonio will become a sales office in the near future 
each hub manages the freight originating in or destined for its service area 
in a typical intermodal transaction  the customer contacts the local hub to obtain shipping schedules and a price quote for a particular freight movement 
the local hub obtains the necessary intermodal equipment  arranges for it to be delivered to the customer by a drayage company and  after the freight is loaded  arranges for the transportation of the container or trailer to the rail ramp 
information is entered into the aim system by the local hub  which monitors the shipment to ensure that it will arrive as scheduled 
this information is simultaneously transmitted through the aim system to the hub closest to the point of delivery  which arranges for and confirms delivery by a drayage company 
this arrangement among the hubs is transparent to the customer and allows the customer to maintain its relationship solely with the originating hub 
the company provides brokerage services to its customers in a similar manner 
in a typical brokerage transaction  the customer contacts the local hub to obtain transit information and a price quote for a particular freight movement 
the customer then provides appropriate shipping information to the local hub 
the local hub makes the delivery appointment and arranges with the appropriate carrier to pick up the freight 
once it receives confirmation that the freight has been picked up  the local hub monitors the movement of the freight until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed 
if the carrier notifies hub group that after delivering the load it will need additional freight  the hub located nearest the destination is notified of the carrier s availability 
although it is under no obligation to do so  the local hub then may attempt  if requested by the carrier  to secure freight for the carrier 
marketing and customers the company believes that fostering long term customer relationships is critical to the company s success 
through these long term relationships  the company is able to better understand its customer s needs and to tailor transportation services for a specific customer  regardless of the customer s size or volume 
the company has created a database of current and prospective customers  profiling each customer s shipping patterns  which the company periodically updates 
this database allows the company to target its marketing to meet each customer s specific requirements 
the company currently has full time marketing representatives at each hub with primary responsibility for servicing local and regional accounts 
these sales representatives work from the hubs and the company s satellite sales offices 
this network provides a local marketing contact for small and medium shippers in most major metropolitan areas within the united states 
in  the company organized national accounts to service the needs of the nation s largest shippers 
the company recognized that although large shippers originate freight from multiple locations throughout the country  their logistics function is usually centralized 
the company essentially mirrored this structure by servicing national accounts from a central location and parceling out the servicing of individual freight shipments to the appropriate hub 
there are currently national accounts sales representatives who report to the company s executive vice president of national accounts 
the national accounts sales representatives regularly call on the nation s largest shippers to develop business relationships and to expand the company s participation in servicing their transportation needs 
when a business opportunity is identified by a national accounts sales representative  the company s market development and pricing personnel and the local hubs work together to provide a transportation solution tailored to the customer s needs 
local hubs provide transportation services to national accounts customers 
after the plan is implemented  national accounts personnel maintain regular contact with the shipper to ensure customer satisfaction and to refine the process as necessary 
this unique combination of local and regional marketing has produced a large  diverse customer base 
the company services customers in a wide variety of industries  including automotive  consumer products  printing  paper  retail  chemicals and electronics 
management information system a primary component of the company s business strategy is the continued improvement of its aim system and other technology to ensure that the company will remain a leader among transportation providers in information processing for intermodal transportation 
the aim system consists of a network of ibm as computers located at the hubs and linked to a host computer at the company s headquarters 
hub group uses ibm s global network as the nucleus for linking its computers and databases 
this configuration provides a real time environment for transmitting data among the hubs and the company s headquarters using electronic data interchange edi  electronic mail and other protocols 
it also allows hub to communicate electronically with each railroad  certain drayage companies and those customers with edi capabilities 
the company s proprietary aim system is the primary mechanism used by the hubs to process customer transportation requests  schedule and track shipments  prepare customer billing  establish account profiles and retain critical information for analysis 
the aim system provides mainframe to mainframe connectivity with each of the major rail carriers  enabling the company to electronically schedule and track shipments in a real time environment 
in addition  the aim system s edi features offer customers with edi capability a completely paperless process  including load tendering  shipment dispatch  shipment tracking  customer billing and remittance processing 
the company aggressively pursues opportunities to establish edi interfaces with its customers and carriers 
to more effectively manage its highway services business  the company recently installed software visual movement that was co developed with the visual movement corporation 
just as the aim system has helped automate the company s intermodal operations  this software is designed to automate the company s highway services operations 
visual movement processes customer transportation requests  schedules and tracks shipments  prepares customer billing  establishes account profiles and retains critical information for analysis 
it also interfaces with the carrier by handling load tendering  shipment dispatch  shipment tracking  customer billing and remittance processing 
relationship with railroads a key element of the company s business strategy is to strengthen its close working relationship with each of the major intermodal railroads in the united states 
the company views its relationship with the railroads as a partnership 
due to the company s size and relative importance  many railroads have dedicated support personnel to focus on the company s day to day service requirements 
on a semi annual basis  senior executives of the company and each of the railroads meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation 
several of the company s executive officers  including both the company s chairman and president  are former railroad employees  which makes them well suited to understand the railroads service capabilities 
the company has contracts with each of the following railroads burlington northern santa fe railway illinois central canadian national kansas city southern canadian pacific norfolk southern conrail union pacific csx these contracts govern the transportation services and payment terms pursuant to which the company s intermodal shipments are handled by the railroads 
the contracts have staggered renewal terms with the earliest expiration at the end of december while there can be no assurances that these contracts will be renewed  the company has in the past successfully negotiated extensions of the contracts with the railroads 
transportation rates are market driven and are typically negotiated between the company and the railroads on a customer specific basis 
consistent with industry practice  many of the rates negotiated by the company are special commodity quotations scqs  which provide discounts from published price lists based on competitive market factors and are designed by the railroads to attract new business or to retain existing business 
scq rates are generally issued for the account of a single imc 
scq rates apply to specific customers in specified shipping lanes for a specific period of time  usually six to months 
relationship with drayage companies in  the company instituted its quality drayage program  which consists of agreements and rules that govern the framework pursuant to which the drayage companies perform services for the company 
participants in the program commit to provide high quality service  clean and safe equipment  maintain a defined on time performance level and follow specified procedures designed to minimize freight loss and damage 
whenever possible  the company uses the services of drayage companies that participate in its quality drayage program 
however  during periods of high demand for drayage services or at the request of a customer  the company will use the services of other drayage companies 
the local hubs negotiate drayage rates for transportation between specific origin and destination points 
these rates generally are valid  with minor exceptions for fuel surcharge increases  for a period of one year 
relationship with truckload carriers the company s brokerage operation has a large and growing number of active carriers in its database which it uses to transport freight 
the local hubs deal daily with these carriers on an operational level 
hub highway services handles the administrative and regulatory aspects of the carrier relationship 
hub s relationships with its carriers are important since these relationships determine pricing  load coverage and overall service 
risk management and insurance the company requires all drayage companies participating in the quality drayage program to carry at least million in general liability insurance and million in cargo insurance 
railroads  which are self insured  provide limited common carrier liability protection  generally up to  per shipment  although higher coverage is available on a load by load basis 
to cover freight damage when a carrier s liability cannot be established or a carrier s insurance is insufficient to cover freight loss or damage  the company carries its own cargo insurance with a limit of million per container or trailer and a limit of million per occurrence 
the company also carries million of general liability insurance with a companion million umbrella policy on this general liability insurance 
government regulation hub highway services  a partnership controlled by the company  is licensed by the department of transportation dot as a broker in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle 
to the extent that the hubs perform truck brokerage services  they do so under the license granted to hub highway services 
the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity  including certain surety bonding requirements 
while the dot requires a  surety bond to maintain this license  the company has voluntarily posted a  surety bond 
to date  compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for  and cost of providing  transportation services 
competition the transportation services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes against other imcs  as well as logistics companies  third party brokers  over the road truckload carriers and railroads that market their own intermodal services 
in addition  there is an emerging trend for larger truckload carriers to enter into agreements with railroads to market intermodal services nationwide 
competition is based primarily on freight rates  quality of service  reliability  transit time and scope of operations 
several transportation service companies and truckload carriers  and all of the major railroads  have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
general employees as of february   the company had approximately  employees 
the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory 
other no material portion of the company s operations is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government 
the company has not spent a material amount on company sponsored research and development activities or on customer sponsored research activities 
none of the company s patents and trademarks is believed to be material to the company 
the company s business is seasonal to the extent that certain customer groups  such as retail  are seasonal 
item properties the company directly  or indirectly through the hub partnerships  operates offices throughout the united states and in canada and mexico  including the company s headquarters in lombard  illinois  its national accounts office in stamford  connecticut  four national accounts sales offices  hub logistics offices in lombard and stamford and hub distribution s office 
the office buildings used by the hubs located in toledo and kansas city are owned  and the remainder are leased 
the office building in kansas city is subject to a mortgage 
most office leases have initial terms of more than one year  and many include options to renew 
while some of the company s leases are month to month and others expire in the near term  the company does not believe that it will have difficulty in renewing them or in finding alternative office space 
the company believes that its offices are adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used 
item legal proceedings the company is a party to routine litigation incident to its business  primarily claims for freight lost or damaged in transit or improperly shipped 
most of the lawsuits to which the company is party are covered by insurance and are being defended by the company s insurance carriers 
management does not believe that the litigation to which it is currently a party  if determined adversely to the company  would individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

on may   hub group  inc purchased the rights to service the customers of american president lines domestic distribution services apldds  a division of apl land transport services  inc  from its parent  american president companies  ltd 
the revenue of hub partnerships and apldds is many multiples of the revenue of hub chicago 
as a result  consolidated revenue and operating expense for hub group  inc and its subsidiaries the company increased dramatically in the periods subsequent to march  as a result of the apldds acquisition  the company acquired the right to service apldds customers  but did not assume any assets or liabilities associated with that business 
furthermore  the company hired only of the more than employees in the apldds organization 
the apldds business was absorbed directly into the operations of hub chicago and hub partnerships and management believes the associated incremental operating costs are significantly less than the historical operating costs experienced by apldds 
management does not track the incremental purchased transportation and operating costs attributable to the acquired apldds business

see outlook  risks and uncertainties net revenue net revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to in from in the increase is attributed to hub chicago having a lower net revenue percentage on its business as compared to hub partnerships

the increase in the percentage is attributed to hub chicago having a lower salaries and benefits percentage as compared to hub partnerships

expenditures for information systems increased as the company enhanced its operating systems to provide better customer service as well as to further develop and expand the capabilities of its web site 
rent increased as many of the company s hubs were required to obtain larger office space to accommodate present operations and future growth 
expenditures for equipment leases increased as the company moved towards leasing  as opposed to purchasing  more of its office and computer equipment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in this increase is attributed primarily to the increase in goodwill amortization

the business acquired from apldds on may  had been experiencing significant decline during and the first quarter of this decline had a negative influence on the pro forma revenue growth rate 
excluding the revenue relating to apldds prior to the acquisition on may   hub chicago and hub partnerships  on a combined basis assuming hub chicago had acquired hub partnerships on january   experienced a revenue increase of to million in from million in this percentage increase is primarily attributable to strong growth in truckload brokerage and logistics as well as the acquisition of the apldds business

pro forma net revenue as a percentage of pro forma revenue increased to in from in on a pro forma basis  net revenue as a percentage of revenue for the apldds business was and for and the period january  through may   respectively 
management believes that the net revenue percentage on the transitioned apldds business has improved modestly over the apldds pro forma net revenue percentage 
the lower pro forma percentages experienced by apldds causes the current year percentages to compare favorably to the prior year percentages 
this favorable pro forma comparison is partially offset by the lower net revenue percentage experienced by the addition of new logistics customers in late and early salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased to million in from million in pro forma salaries and benefits increased to million in from million in apldds was a division of apl land transport services  inc apl and consequently received much of its support services from apl 
in return for these services  apldds was assessed a management fee

for and the period january  through may   salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue for apldds were and  respectively 
pro forma salaries and benefits as a percentage of pro forma revenue increased to for from in  which is partially attributed to the historical cost structure of apldds 
the company s investment in additional personnel in also contributed to this increase

to calculate a pro forma minority interest factor  it was estimated that the minority interest would accrue its ownership in hub partnerships  which operates of the apldds business 
as such  minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest and provision for income taxes of was applied to pro forma income before minority interest for apldds for and the period january   through may  on a pro forma basis  minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest and provision for income taxes was for and for the higher minority interest percentage in was the result of the significant loss reported by apldds combined with a lower pro forma minority interest factor that was applied to that loss as compared to the factor applied to the rest of the company s income

in addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this section  such risks and uncertainties include the impact of competitive pressures in the marketplace  the degree and rate of market growth in the markets served by the company  changes in industry wide capacity  further consolidation of rail carriers  changes in governmental regulation  changes in the cost of services from vendors and fluctuations in interest rates 
year based on management s recent assessment  the company has determined that it is required to modify portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  if such upgrades or modifications are not made  or are not made in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram and test software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year project not later than december  the year total project cost is estimated to range from million to million 
costs are expected to be expensed as incurred 
the company had not incurred significant costs prior to december  triggered call options the company plans to consolidate all of its texas operations into one entity after it exercises its options to purchase the remaining minority interests in hub rio grande  hub houston and hub dallas 
the company estimates that these three minority interest purchases will cost million in total 
revenue management believes there are two significant factors that could negatively influence the company s revenue growth rate 
first  the service disruption in the intermodal industry that peaked in the fourth quarter of has not yet been fully rectified 
although there has been improvement in the first quarter of  management cannot predict when normal service levels will be restored 
furthermore  due to this service disruption  there may be some customers who switched from using the company s intermodal service to other carriers over the road service 
these customers may choose to continue to utilize these carriers even when intermodal service levels are restored 
second  the company terminated its contract to provide third party logistics to a significant customer in january this customer accounted for million of the company s revenue in revenue should be positively impacted if the company should complete its proposed acquisition of quality  which had revenue of approximately million in net revenue management expects fluctuations in the net revenue percentage from quarter to quarter caused by changes in business mix  changes in highway brokerage margins  changes in logistics business margins  changes in trailer and container capacity  changes in vendor pricing  changes in intermodal industry growth  changes in intermodal industry service levels and changes in accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits it is anticipated that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range are revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses or changes in customer requirements which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
should management decide that customer expectations and the competitive environment require restructuring of its information systems and related platforms  there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
costs incurred to formulate the company s strategy as well as any costs that would be identified as reengineering or training would be expensed 
the company also expects to spend approximately million to million in programming costs to make its systems compliant with year requirements 
depreciation and amortization management estimates that as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization will increase in the future 
factors that will cause an increase in the percentage are increased leasehold improvement amortization as operating companies transition to larger facilities  increased software amortization related to the new packages in the truckload brokerage and logistics businesses and a full year of goodwill amortization associated with the minority interests purchased in september related to hub los angeles and hub golden gate 
should the company complete its proposed acquisition of quality  the company will incur additional goodwill amortization 
should the company carry out its plan to purchase the remaining minority interests related to hub rio grande  hub dallas and hub houston  the company will incur additional goodwill amortization 
factors that could cause an increase in the percentage are additional acquisitions or minority interest purchases as well as increased depreciation expense on any capitalized costs that could be incurred in conjunction with a change in the company s information systems strategy 
other income expense management estimates interest expense will increase primarily due to the increase in debt that will result if the company completes its proposed acquisition of quality and concurrently exercises its call options to purchase the remaining minority interests in hub rio grande  hub houston and hub dallas 
the company estimates that these transactions will increase debt by approximately million 
management estimates that interest income will likely decrease from current levels 
factors that could cause such a decrease are the possible use of cash to i make payments on the balloon notes  ii make payments on the apldds notes  iii make payments on the company s line of credit  iv fund the purchase of the remaining minority interest in any of its operating partnerships  v fund working capital needs and vi fund capital expenditures 
minority interest factors that could have a material impact and result in minority interest percentages of income before minority interest to be outside the historical range are i the exercise of any of the company s options to purchase the remaining minority interest in any of its operating companies and ii disproportionate changes in the profitability of businesses between those which are owned by the company and those which are owned less than by the company 
the purchase of the remaining minority interests in hub los angeles and hub golden gate in september  assuming all other factors affecting minority interest are equal  should cause minority interest as a percentage of income before minority interest to decline 
the decline in this percentage should be even greater if the company exercises its existing triggered call options for hub rio grande  hub houston and hub dallas 
earnings per common share management believes the company will continue to see downward pressure on diluted earnings per common share in as the railroad industry continues to rectify its the well publicized intermodal service problems that peaked during the fourth quarter of diluted earnings per common share were in the fourth quarter of and dropped to in the fourth quarter of the first quarter of resulted in diluted earnings per common share of 
it is management s belief that diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter of will decrease to from the same quarter in a decline in diluted earnings per common share from the prior year will likely continue until the intermodal industry recovers from its service problems and reestablishes itself as a dependable service provider 
liquidity and capital resources the company has the continuing option  exercisable any time after the local in charge executive currently associated with an operating partnership ceases to be an employee  to purchase the remaining interest in that partnership 
the future exercise of such options could result in the need for significant funds 
those funds may come from existing cash  third party debt  other financing or any combination thereof 
the company expects to complete the acquisition of quality as well as exercise its call options related to hub rio grande  hub dallas and hub houston 
management believes its line of credit will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements related to these transactions 
the company believes that cash  cash to be provided by operations and cash available under its lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs through at least the year item a
