outstanding debt and capital lease obligations aggregated million at december  compared to million at december  net loss increased million to million in compared to million in  largely due to the ag acquisition and several nonrecurring one time charges ie  litigation settlement  polar restructuring expense  investment write off  writedown of equipment to net realizable value and severance expense totaling million  net of tax  and a loss on disposition of equipment of million  net of tax  in  which more than offset the nonrecurring one time charges ie  merger consummation costs  amortization of debt issuance  costs and loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million  net of tax  and a gain on disposition of equipment of million  net of tax  in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a net working capital deficit of million  primarily as a result of the financing of revenue equipment purchases noncurrent assets through borrowings  a portion of which is reflected in current liabilities 
the company historically has funded its working capital requirements through a combination of operating profits  short turnover in trade receivables  effective cash management practices and borrowing under its revolving bank line of credit

as the company continues to facilitate its planned future growth  the company s capital needs may require additional borrowings or an equity infusion 
change in estimated salvage values in december  the company adjusted the estimated salvage values related to certain motor carrier equipment of polar from to of the original purchase price 
the change better aligns the allocation of equipment cost with its expected use

seasonality the company s results of operations show a seasonal pattern because certain of the frozen food companies serviced by the company generally reduce shipments during the summer season 
during the winter months  the company has at times experienced delays in meeting its pick up and delivery schedules as a result of severe weather conditions 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
accordingly  such factors cause fluctuations in results of operations 
the foliage division of asche transfer experiences seasonal fluctuations in volume during certain periods of the year 
year the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
the company also has initiated discussions with its significant suppliers and large customers to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to remediate properly their computer systems 
the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff 
the team s activities are designed to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the company s core business operations and that transactions with customers and suppliers are fully supported 
the company is well under way with these efforts  which are scheduled to be completed in early while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operation or financial position
