while the company believes that the end user of its products evaluates the purchase of such products on the basis of product quality  such purchases are also based on a dealer s service and support and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchases 
demand for products tends to be strongest in the spring and summer growing seasons 
the company provides incentives for off season purchases  including discounts  as a way to even out seasonal variations in its manufacturing cycles 
under incentive programs  there is no right of return 
product development the company believes its ability to quickly provide innovative responses to customer needs  to continue to develop and manufacture new products and to enhance existing product lines is critical to its success 
the company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products 
the company currently employs people in its engineering department  of whom are professionals and the balance of whom are support staff 
amounts expended on research and development activities aggregated approximately  in   in  and  in seasonality the vegetation maintenance equipment industry in general tends to follow the seasonal buying patterns of its major customers with peak sales occurring in may through august 
agricultural end users generally purchase equipment in the early spring for the beginning of the mowing season 
governmental end users typically wait to purchase new equipment until the first and second calendar quarters 
the timing of these purchases  however  may be affected by weather conditions and general economic conditions 
in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year  the company must estimate seasonal demand months in advance  and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand 
the company utilizes a rolling monthly sales forecast from the company s marketing divisions in order to develop a master production plan for its manufacturing facilities 
additionally  the company attempts to equalize demand for its products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which provide additional discounts on equipment that is ordered during off season periods 
competition the company s products are sold in markets where the principal competitive factors are price  quality  service and reputation 
the company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of agricultural equipment and replacement parts  as well as numerous small  privately held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products 
however  the company has fewer competitors in the wide swath and boom mounted mowing equipment and within the governmental niche 
some of the company s competitors are significantly larger than the company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal 
the company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by containing its manufacturing costs  offering high quality products  developing and designing innovative products and  to some extent  by avoiding direct competition with significantly larger competitors 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with those of the company 
the company believes that within the us it is the largest supplier within governmental markets for its kind of equipment  the third largest supplier in the us agricultural market for such equipment and one of the two largest suppliers in the european market for such equipment 
unfilled orders as of december   the company had unfilled customer orders of million compared to million at the end of management expects that substantially all of the company s backlog as of december   will be shipped during fiscal year the amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors  including the scheduling of manufacturing and shipping of the product  which in most instances is dependent on the company s seasonal sales programs and the needs of the customer 
certain of the company s orders are generally subject to cancellation anytime before shipment  therefore  a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
sources of supply the principal raw materials used by the company include steel and purchased components 
during  the raw materials needed by the company were available from a variety of sources in adequate quantities and at prevailing market prices

while the company manufactures many of the parts for its products  a significant percentage of parts  including most drive lines  gear boxes and hydraulic pumps and motors  are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the company s specifications 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of parts purchased by the company s us operations are imported
