 reporting comprehensive income

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement  effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december   requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
the company has not yet determined the impact of this statement on its financial statements 
inflation for the last several years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the outstanding leases expire within five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate
