joseph  joplin and monett 
sfng  acquired as of december   serves portions of central florida including new smyrna beach  edgewater and areas of volusia county  florida 
sfng s results of operations since its acquisition do not materially impact comparability between fiscal years discussed below 
the company also operates natural gas pipeline systems  markets natural gas to end users  distributes propane and holds invest ments in real estate and other assets 
to achieve profitability and continued growth  the company continues to emphasize gas sales in nontraditional markets  operating efficiencies of existing systems  and expansion through selective acquisitions of new systems 
results of operations net earnings southern union company s fiscal year ended june net earnings were  
per common share  diluted for outstanding options and warrants hereafter referred to as per share  compared with  
per share in the decrease was primarily due to the pre tax write off of previously recorded regulatory assets as ordered by the missouri public service commission mpsc 
on august   the missouri court of appeals denied the previously dis closed appeal by the company of the mpsc s january rate order granted to mge 
because of this decision  the company recorded a one time non cash write off of  of deferred costs recorded since on august   the mpsc also granted mge a rate increase which  among other things  disallowed certain previously recorded deferred costs requiring an addi tional pre tax non cash write off of  significantly warmer weather in the winter of  especially in missouri  also contributed to the decrease in earnings  despite an  annual increase to mge revenues granted by the mpsc effective february  weather in the missouri service territories during was warmer than while gas sales volumes in the corresponding period decreased 
average common and common share equivalents outstanding increased in due to the issuance of  pre split shares of the company s common stock on december  in connection with the acquisi tion of atlantic utilities corporation and subsidiaries in florida 
the company earned on average common equity in the company s net earnings were  
per share  compared with  
per share in the decrease was primarily due to  in additional bad debt expense in as a result of significant increases in delin quent customer accounts  principally at mge 
the significant increase in natural gas prices during caused many customers to receive considerably higher heating bills 
additionally  cer tain billing errors were discovered in mge s billing practices and procedures 
as a result of the customer s increased bills and negative media coverage over the high gas costs and billing errors  more customers than usual failed to pay their bills causing an unanticipated increase in aged receivables  primarily in missouri 
mge also responded to an mpsc directive to delay collection efforts by suspending the disconnection of customers for non payment until july also adversely impacting net earnings was  in various settlement fees in connec tion with complaints brought by the missouri office of public counsel and the mpsc for the billing errors 
contributing to net earnings were additional revenues of  under a gas supply incentive plan approved by the mpsc in july under the plan  southern union and its missouri customers shared in certain savings below benchmark levels of gas costs incurred as a result of the company s gas procurement activities 
the in centive plan achieved a reduction of overall gas costs of  resulting in savings to missouri customers of  average common and common share equivalents out standing increased in the company earned and on average common equity in and  respectively 
operating revenues operating revenues in decreased  or  to  while gas purchase costs decreased  or  to  operating revenues and gas purchase costs in were affected by both a reduction in gas sales volumes and decreases in the cost of gas 
gas sales volumes decreased in to  mmcf due to the warmer winter weather in the missouri service territories 
gas sales volumes were also impacted by a reduction in average usage per customer throughout the company s service territories as a result of more energy efficient housing and appliances 
the average cost of gas decreased 
to per mcf in due to decreases in average spot market gas prices throughout the company s distribution system as a result of sea sonal impacts on demands for natural gas and the ensuing competi tive pricing within the industry 
the average spot market price of natural gas decreased to per million british thermal units mmbtu in additionally impacting operating revenues in was a  decrease in gross receipt taxes  a  decrease in gas transportation revenues at mge  and decreased revenues of  under the previously discussed gas supply incentive plan

operating revenues were favorably impacted by an  annual increase to revenues granted by the mpsc effective as of february  southern union gas and mge contributed and  respectively  of the company s consolidated operating revenues 
four sup pliers provided of gas purchases in gas purchase costs generally do not directly affect earnings since these costs are generally passed on to customers pursuant to purchase gas adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while changes in the cost of gas may cause the company s operating revenues to fluctuate  net operating margin is generally not affected by increases or decreases in the cost of gas 
increases in gas purchase costs indirectly affect earnings as the customer s bill increases  usually resulting in increased bad debt and collection costs being recorded by the company 
gas transportation volumes in decreased  mmcf to  mmcf at an average transportation rate per mcf of 
compared with 
in transportation volumes increased from  mmcf to  mmcf in for mge and decreased from  mmcf to  mmcf in for southern union gas and the com pany s pipeline subsidiaries 
this decrease was mainly caused by a decrease  or  mmcf  in the amount of volumes trans ported into mexico by norteno pipeline company  a subsidiary of the company 
operating revenues in increased  or  to  while gas purchase costs increased  or  to  operating revenues and gas purchase costs in were affected by an increase in the average cost of gas and greater gas sales volumes 
the average cost of gas increased 
to per mcf in due to increases in spot market gas prices as a result of the increased demand for natural gas during the winter season 
the average spot market price of natural gas increased to per mmbtu  in gas sales volumes increased in to  mmcf due to growth in pipeline and marketing sales which typically have lower margins 
this was partially offset by a reduction in volumes of mmcf from the sale of certain operations in the texas and oklahoma panhandles on may  additionally impacting operating revenues was the  annual increase to revenues granted by the mpsc effec tive as of february   and increased revenues under the gas supply incentive plan  previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase in operating revenues was a  increase in gross receipt taxes 
southern union gas and mge contributed and  respectively  of the company s consolidated operating revenues 
four sup pliers provided of gas purchases in gas transportation volumes in increased mmcf to  mmcf at an average transportation rate per mcf of 
compared with 
in transportation volumes decreased from  mmcf to  mmcf in for mge and increased in for southern union gas and the company s pipeline sub sidiaries 
this was partially offset by a reduction in volumes of  mmcf from the sale of certain operations  previously discussed 
net operating margin net operating margin in operating revenues less gas purchase costs and revenue related taxes increased by  compared with an increase of  in operating margins and earnings are primarily dependent upon gas sales volumes and gas service rates 
the level of gas sales volumes is sensitive to the variability of the weather 
southern union gas and mge accounted for and  respec tively  of the company s net operating margin in and and  respectively  in weather weather in the missouri service territories in was of a year measure  warmer than in weather in in southern union gas service territories was of a year measure  colder than in weather in missouri in both and was of the year measure  while weather in the southern union gas service territories in was of the year measure  colder than in customers the average number of customers served in  and was   and  respectively

taxes other than on income and revenues  prin cipally consisting of property  payroll and state franchise taxes  in increased  to  the increase was primarily due to increases in property taxes resulting from the inclusion of certain plant assets pursuant to the mge safety program that were deferred prior to the february  revenue increase in missouri

the company continually reviews the adequacy of its gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
regulatory the majority of the company s business activities are subject to various regulatory authorities 
the company s finan cial condition and results of operations have been and will con tinue to be dependent upon the receipt of adequate and timely adjustments in rates 
gas service rates  which consist of a monthly fixed charge and a gas usage charge  are established by regulatory authorities and are intended to permit utilities the opportunity to recover operating  administrative and financing costs and to have the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity 
the monthly fixed charge provides a base revenue stream while the usage charge increases the company s revenues and earnings in colder weather when natural gas usage increases 
on september   the mpsc approved a global settlement among the company  the missouri office of public counsel opc and mpsc to resolve complaints brought by the opc and the mpsc staff regarding billing errors during the and winter heating seasons

ad ditionally  the order authorized mge to establish an experimental price stabilization fund for purposes of procuring natural gas financial instruments to hedge a minimal portion of its gas pur chase costs for the winter heating season 
the cost of pur chasing these financial instruments and any gains derived from such activities are passed on to the missouri customers through the pga 
accordingly  there is no earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments 
these procedures help stabilize the monthly heating bills for missouri customers 
the company believes it bears minimal risk under the authorized transactions 
the mpsc also approved a three year  experimental gas supply incentive plan for mge effective july  under the plan  the company and mge s customers share in certain savings below benchmark levels of gas costs achieved as a result of the com pany s gas procurement activities 
likewise  if natural gas is acquired above benchmark levels  both the company and customers share in such costs

this program includes replacement of company and customer owned gas service and yard lines  the movement and resetting of meters  the replacement of cast iron mains and the replacement and cathodic protection of bare steel mains 
in recognition of the significant capital ex penditures associated with this safety program  the mpsc permits the deferral  and subsequent recovery through rates  of deprecia tion expense  property taxes and associated carrying costs 
the continuation of the mge safety program will result in significant levels of future capital expenditures

the company is continuing to pursue certain changes to rates and rate structures that are intended to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to weather including weather normalization clauses and higher minimum monthly service charges

these clauses allow for the adjustments that help stabilize customers monthly bills and the company s earnings from the varying effects of weather 
year similar to all business entities  the company will be impacted by the inability of computer application software pro grams to distinguish between the year and due to a commonly used programming convention 
unless such programs are modified or replaced prior to  calculations and interpreta tions based on date based arithmetic or logical operations per formed by such programs may be incorrect 
management s plan addressing the impact of the year issue on the company focuses on the following areas application systems  process control systems embedded chips  technology infrastruc ture  physical infrastructure  and third party business partners and suppliers with which the company has significant relation ships 
management s analysis and review of these areas is com prised primarily of five phases developing an inventory of hardware  software and embedded chips  assessing the degree to which each area is currently in compliance with year requirements  performing renovations and repairs as needed to attain compliance  testing to ensure compliance  and developing a contingency plan if repair and renovation efforts are either unsuccessful or untimely 
management has substantially completed the inventory and assess ment phases regarding application systems  process control sys tems and technology infrastructure  and is performing renovations  repairs and testing of the former two categories 
the review of physical infrastructure and business partners  gas transporters and suppliers is in the inventory stage 
while the company anticipates that any additional inventory and assessment efforts will be completed by the end of calendar year  renovation  repair and testing of affected areas will continue through calendar year costs incurred to date have pri marily consisted of labor from the redeployment of existing information technology  legal and operational resources 
the company expects to spend approximately million for these year compliance efforts 
to the extent that such costs are incurred in year compliance efforts  the company will attempt recovery for such costs through regulatory relief 
in addition to the activities described above  the company is currently replacing some of its financial and operating software programs with new programs that will be year compliant 
these new programs have significantly reduced the costs the com pany expects to incur to become year compliant 
however  the company has formed a contingency team to develop a work plan in the event that such programs are not fully operational by the end of calendar year the costs associated with this effort are being evaluated and cannot yet be determined 
although the company does not presently anticipate a material business inter ruption as a result of the year  the worst case scenario if all of the company s year efforts failed  including the failure of third party providers to deliver services  could result in daily lost revenues of approximately  this estimate is based on historical revenues recognized in the month of january
