in total  international sales of mobile electronics products increased million in telecommunication products sales decreased million because of lower sales of both channel cordless phones and integrated cordless phone answering systems to several large retail customers 
also contributing to the sales decrease was lower sales of factory reconditioned products as a result of agreements with some of the company s vendors that allow product returned from the company s customers to be returned to the vendor for partial credit towards future purchases 
prior to these agreements  which were entered into in  the company repaired and resold this returned merchandise as factory reconditioned product 
the company also restricted expanding distribution for its channel cordless phones as it seeks to de emphasize this product line in favor of the rapidly growing mhz segment which the company will enter in the fall of with several mhz cordless phone models
