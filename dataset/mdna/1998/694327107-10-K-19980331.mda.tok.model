overview pacific gateway was founded in august to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in the international telecommunications services market 
the company operates an international network consisting of international and domestic switching facilities in the u 
s in new york  los angeles  and dallas and offshore in the united kingdom  new zealand and russia 
the company has partial ownership interests in digital undersea fiber optic cables systems in the atlantic  pacific and caribbean regions and operating agreements with foreign carriers that provide for the exchange of telecommunications traffic 
as of december   the company had operating agreements in countries around the world  which provide for the exchange of telecommunications traffic with these carriers 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of international telecommunications services to us based carriers on a wholesale basis and from the traffic received by the company under operating agreements with its foreign partners 
in addition  the company has begun to recognize revenue from retail customers generated by pintouch the company s joint venture with globe telecom 
the majority of the company s costs are variable and consist of payments to foreign partners for the termination of traffic  payments to other providers of long distance services for transmission services to countries where the company does not have operating agreements  payments to domestic carriers for the termination of overseas originated traffic in the united states where the company does not have its own domestic network and payments to local exchange companies for access charges for originating and terminating international and domestic traffic where the company has its own domestic network 
the company generally enters new markets by establishing operating agreements with foreign partners and by investing in or leasing digital undersea fiber optic cable in order to cost effectively carry and terminate traffic 
the company seeks to have ownership positions in cable systems where it believes its customers demand will justify the investment in those fixed assets 
although the company is generally able to earn a higher gross margin on traffic routed through its owned circuits relative to leased routes  pacific gateway will continue to buy usage sensitive transmission capacity on a per minute basis from other us facilities based international carriers on routes where traffic volumes are relatively low or inconsistent  as well as to manage overflow traffic on busy routes 
under its operating agreements  the company typically agrees to send us originated traffic to its foreign partners and its foreign partners agree to send a proportionate amount of return traffic via the company s network at negotiated rates 
these agreements contractually obligate the foreign partners to adhere to the policy of the fcc  whereby traffic from the foreign country is routed to us based international carriers  such as the company  in the same proportion as traffic carried into the foreign country 
the company and its foreign partners typically settle the amounts owed to each other in cash on a net basis  subsequent to the receipt of return traffic 
the company records the amount due to the foreign partners as an expense in the period the company s traffic is delivered 
of the company s operating agreements in service as of december   agreements provide that the company must wait up to six months before it actually receives the proportional return traffic 
the delay period between the company s delivery of us originated traffic and the receipt of the proportional return traffic enables the carriers to determine the appropriate traffic exchange ratio based on the company s relative market share on a particular route 
as a result  the company delivers outbound traffic and generally recognizes a loss in the period in which it sells to its customers because amounts due to foreign partners generally exceed revenues from customers on outbound traffic 
the company then recognizes revenues with minimal associated cost on the associated return traffic on a six month delayed basis 
the rates that the company charges its customers are established at a level such that the company expects to recognize a gross profit on the combined transactions 
the following table sets forth income statement data as a percentage of revenues for the period indicated 
year ended december  total revenues cost of long distance services gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation total operating expenses operating income other income expenses  net interest income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of an active us market and growth of the company s offshore sites in the us  russia and new zealand 
sales to existing customers increased as the number of operating agreements grew to at december  from at december  the total number of customers worldwide increased to at december  from at december  as a result  total minutes have increased from last year while the average price per minute charged to customers remained unchanged at cents 
during prices generally declined in the markets in which the company principally operates and may decline further in the future 
however  the company s average price per minute remained unchanged from because the company was able to increase traffic to markets offering higher prices 
the change in the terminating country mix with significantly different rates per minute  the reduction in the rates received for the traffic terminating in and transiting the united states and the increase in the incidental united states domestic terminating traffic  are factors influencing the average customer price per minute 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in the prior year to in the current year  primarily because the company generally paid lower access rates to foreign carriers than it paid in and because in certain countries the competition for call termination has intensified and resulted in lower termination costs for pacific gateway and similar companies 
because the same rate is charged by the foreign carrier to terminate calls in its country as pacific gateway charges to terminate calls in the united states  declining rates have an adverse effect on revenue 
however  because the company sends more minutes to foreign partners than it receives from them  declining rates improve the company s gross margin received on its transactions with such foreign carriers 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was lower during the second half of primarily because the company s revenues increased significantly from million for the first half of to million for the second half of significant revenue increases generally reduce the company s short term gross margin for two reasons  which again took effect in the second half of first  to terminate the additional traffic efficiently  the company incurs the expense of building new facilities and reconfiguring its us network 
second  until such can be achieved  the company has no choice but to terminate the additional traffic over less efficient  higher cost routes 
margins on the additional revenue are expected to improve as the company begins to terminate the new traffic more efficiently  but this margin improvement may be offset in future periods by sharp revenue increases  expenses for the new facilities  competitive pricing pressures and other factors 
the cost of long distance service increased to million for the year ended december  from million at december  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in the prior year to in the current year and the actual expenses increased to million from million 
this increase was due primarily to increased personnel as the number of employees grew to from the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and to from its majority owned russian subsidiary at december  from at december  in addition  the company incurred higher sales commission expenses due to increased revenues 
depreciation depreciation increased to million in from million in representing of total revenues 
the increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to depreciation of additional transmission facilities acquired during interest income expense  net interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the company having on average million in cash or cash equivalents during as compared to on average million in cash or cash equivalents during income tax income taxes increased to million from million  primarily due to increased operating income 
the effective tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to earnings of certain non us subsidiaries 
a portion of these earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of both increased sales to existing customers  due to an increase in the number of operating agreements to at december  from at december  and a increase in the number of wholesale carrier customers to at december  from at december  as a result  total minutes increased from while the average price per minute charged to customers slightly declined to cents compared to cents in the revenue from matrix increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this k for further information regarding the company s transactions with matrix 
gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased from in to in this increase resulted from savings derived from a reduction in the transit or resale rates on the routes in which the company did not have a direct operating agreement  a reduction in the foreign access charges on the routes in which the company had a direct operating agreement and a reduction in the domestic termination rates in the united states 
these savings were offset by the effects of an increase in the estimated return traffic revenue backlog  which adversely effects the current gross margin 
the cost of long distance service increased to million for the year ended december  from million at december  this increase in costs represented growth in outbound traffic on new and existing routes in advance of receiving proportional return traffic  resulting in an increase in the estimated delayed proportional return traffic backlog amount at december  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in and the actual expenses increased to million from million 
this increase was due primarily to increased personnel and sales commission expenses 
the increase in personnel expenses was directly related to the increase in employees to at december  from at december  the increase in sales commission expenses was primarily due to increased revenues 
depreciation depreciation increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  depreciation was of revenue for the year ended december   and in the increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to depreciation of additional transmission facilities acquired during interest income expense  net the company had interest income of million in compared to interest expense of million in this was due to the successful completion of the initial public offering in july resulting in the company having million in cash or cash equivalents and no line of credit outstanding at december  compared to million of cash and million owing under the lines of credit available to the company at december  income tax income taxes increased to million from million  primarily due to increased operating income 
the effective tax rate was in and in liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its rapid growth  including its capital expenditures  through funds provided by operations and the funds from the public offering completed in the third quarter of due to the timing differences in the international settlements  the company s accounts receivable turnover varies from its accounts payable turnover 
the length of these turnovers is a function of different timing requirements in the company s agreements with foreign partners 
for example  the length of the company s accounts payable turnover is partially due to its accounts payable with foreign partners  which generally have day terms as a result of the six month lag in the international settlement process 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december   from million and million for the years ended december  and the increases in and were primarily a result of an increase in net income as well as accounts payable  which exceeded the increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in  from million in and million in the expenditures in all three years were primarily for the acquisition of partial ownership interests in international fiber optic cable transmission systems and related equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during the third quarter of  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares were offered by the company  which provided the company with net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used million of the proceeds to repay an outstanding line of credit with a major shareholder of the company 
the deficit in working capital excluding cash at december  was compared to a deficit of million at december  and million at december  this is due to the significant delay that occurs in both paying and receiving cash for the minutes sent and received from overseas 
this is partially offset by the estimated return traffic revenue backlog of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at december   the company had outstanding commitments of million for the acquisition of additional ownership in digital undersea fiber optic cables and network equipment 
the company believes that existing cash balances  together with cash provided by operating activities and other sources of liquidity  will be sufficient to meet its outstanding capital commitments  current capital expenditures and working capital needs through the end of however  the company may raise additional funds through offerings of equity or debt securities or other financing arrangements to fund growth opportunities that management believes are beneficial to the company 
impact of the year the company has assigned resources to review all systems and selected computer applications to access their ability to process transactions in the year the company is still in the process of determining the extent of systems modifications and or computer software upgrades needed to ensure the systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company has not yet determined the total cost of such modifications and or upgrades
