research and development expenditures  which accounted for of the total costs and expenses in  in and in  decreased to  in from  in and  in the  decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the expenditure of  in for the manufacture of clinical supplies and preclinical testing of napc which were not incurred in  partially offset by an increase of  attributable to the initiation of the vascular targeting program 
see business strategic alliances 
the  increase in as compared to was primarily due to costs incurred in for napc research and development expenses are expected to increase by more than  in primarily due to expanded clinical trials and additional staffing for its ongoing programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in and  in the  increase in as compared with was primarily due to  in increased legal and other costs incurred in connection with business development activities   in increased administrative recruiting and relocation costs   in increased facilities costs and  in increased administrative headcount and related costs

during the first quarter of  a development compound was selected by schering plough in the orally active thrombin inhibitor program  which triggered a  milestone payment  the next milestone in this program is  to be paid upon filing by schering plough of an ind  or its foreign equivalent  for initiating clinical trials in the us or in any corresponding foreign jurisdiction 
in the first quarter of  pfizer notified corvas of a milestone achieved upon pfizer s commencement of a clinical trial for nif  which will result in a payment to corvas of  in the company s collaboration with schering plough covering inhibitors of the replication of the hepatitis c virus  the next milestone is a  payment upon identification of an initial lead compound in this program 
in addition to these milestones  the company may also receive additional milestone payments and royalties on sales of products in connection with its existing alliances  as well as from any future alliances 
if all of the milestones on all of the company s existing collaborations are met  corvas could receive up to a total of  in future milestone payments and research and development funding over the next several years

in june  the company entered into an option agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of vgi  a vascular targeting company 
if this option is exercised prior to its termination on june   the acquisition will be made with newly issued corvas common stock or  in certain circumstances at the option of the company a combination of cash and  shares of common stock 
the aggregate acquisition price  which is based on the timing of option exercise  ranges from a minimum as of december  of  to a maximum of  if this option is exercised  the company expects a noncash charge to earnings for in process research and development 
if corvas elects not to exercise its option  vgi may require the company to purchase of its outstanding stock for  in corvas common stock 
during the option period  corvas will make monthly option payments of approximately  to vgi 
in addition  under a research and development agreement  vgi is required to make monthly payments of  to corvas to be applied to research and development covering the vgi technology 
although the net impact of these payments is not material  the company may incur substantial additional costs to develop this technology 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following continued scientific progress in its drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  the progress of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the costs involved in complying with the regulatory process  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in its existing research relationships  the ability of the company to establish and to maintain collaborative or licensing arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of activities and arrangements to commercialize existing and potential products 
in  the company invested approximately  in capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects to invest approximately  in for additional property and equipment as research and development activities progress 
the company leases its laboratory and office facilities under an operating lease and anticipates that it will need to expand its facilities over the next several years 
to continue its long term product development efforts  the company must raise substantial additional funds through public or private sales of securities  collaborative arrangements or other methods of financing 
the company s ability to raise additional funds through such sales of securities depends in part on investors perceptions of the biotechnology industry  in general  and of the company  in particular 
the market for biotechnology company stocks has historically been highly volatile and  accordingly  there is no assurance that additional funding will be available  or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing securities  further dilution to stockholders will likely result 
the company may enter into additional collaborative relationships to develop and commercialize certain of its current or future technologies or products 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to establish such relationships on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that agreements with collaborators will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
in addition  the company has not attempted to establish bank financing arrangements  and there is no assurance that it would be able to establish such arrangements on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue one or more of its drug discovery programs or other aspects of its operations  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish or at prices below that at which the company would otherwise choose to relinquish such rights

this understanding involves the transfer to ortho of all rights under a license agreement related to recombinant tissue factor pursuant to which the company is currently a licensee  the modification of a license to corvas developed technology from non exclusive to worldwide exclusive  the sale of equipment used in the manufacturing process of such product and the transfer of certain production methodologies 
ortho has assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of such product and accordingly  the company has discontinued its manufacturing operations 
upon completion of this transaction  the company expects to record as revenue in a license payment as well as other income related to the sale of equipment  and will no longer record product sales from this product 
the carrying amount of the equipment to be sold in conjunction with this transfer was not material as of december  there is no assurance that the company will be able to complete this transaction or  if completed  what will be the final terms of such transaction
