item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the building products industry is affected by various factors including general economic conditions  the level of building activity  weather conditions  the rate of new home construction  interest rates and the availability of credit 
a significant portion of the company s products are sold for use in the home improvement  remodeling and repair market  which is relatively less affected by these factors than the new residential construction market 
the company has experienced substantial improvement in its results of operations since its formation in these improvements have included significant increases in sales volume and improvement in the company s operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
the company s revenue have more than tripled from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this revenue growth has been accomplished largely due to acquisitions completed since october  increased sales by existing branches and new branch openings 
further  the company s operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have declined from in fiscal to in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal include a charge of million or and thus for comparative purposes  operating expenses have declined from in fiscal to in fiscal before such charges 
these positive trends have been partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin  which resulted primarily from the product and sales mix of acquired businesses 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined from in fiscal to in fiscal and fiscal the businesses acquired by the company since october typically either have had product lines consisting of narrow assortments of commodity products or have had a relatively high proportion of products distributed through direct shipments from manufacturers 
both of these characteristics result in lower selling margins and a lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
in implementing its operating strategy for acquired businesses  management focuses on improving gross profit as a percentage of revenue  which requires the integration of additional higher margin product lines 
this process takes time to implement because of market conditions  suppliers territorial restrictions and conversion of customers buying requirements and habits 
although the company historically has been able to improve the gross profit margins of acquired businesses and anticipates further improvements  gross profit as a percentage of revenue will likely remain near current levels with some improvement as product mix  pricing and sales mix changes are implemented 
in addition  the growth of the company through its acquisition strategy since has reduced the contribution of its ashley aluminum subsidiary as a percentage of the total operation 
ashley is a speciality products distributor and operates with higher gross profit margins 
operating expenses  because of the different product and sales mix of acquired businesses and the consolidation of various corporate functions  have decreased as a percentage of net sales 
the net effect of these various factors has been a significant increase in the company s income from operations from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal however  due to the declining gross profit margin discussed previously  which was not offset by a reduction in operating expenses  income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal and fiscal and to in fiscal income from operations in fiscal includes a charge of or  and therefore  before such charges  income from operations was of revenue in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million which had a impact on earnings per share eps and consisted of the following a million charge which primarily reflects the merger of four branches in oregon and texas and the closure of a small mill operation 
the charge includes the writeoff of future lease payments on unused facilities in oregon and washington  reduction of inventory to net realizable value  associated severance costs  and certain costs related to the company s recent acquisition activities  and a million writeoff of unamortized costs related to the company s management information system after the installation of a new enterprise wide computer system commencing in fiscal and certain costs associated with the evaluation of the new system 
management estimates the new system will require a million to million capital expenditure and expects the system to be fully operational during fiscal the pre tax charge of million was recorded on the company s income statement as  in cost of sales and  in operating expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took a  charge related to the consolidation of its operations in spokane  washington which had a impact on eps 
the operations in four separate locations were relocated into one  square foot facility to increase efficiency  reduce costs and better service the customer base
