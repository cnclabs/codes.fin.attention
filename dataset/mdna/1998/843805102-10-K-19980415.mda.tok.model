item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview 
this analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of southern security life should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this report 
in recent years the company has primarily issued one type of insurance product  universal life 
universal life provides insurance coverage with flexible premiums  within limits  which allow policyholders to accumulate cash values 
these accumulated cash values are credited with tax deferred interest  as adjusted by the company on a periodic basis 
deducted from these cash accumulations are administrative charges and mortality costs 
should a policy surrender in its early years  the company assesses a surrender fee against these same cash accumulations  based on issue age of the insured  smoker verses non smoker status  sex of the insured and the duration of the policy at the time of surrender 
pursuant to the accounting methods prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  premiums received from policyholders on universal life products are credited to policyholder account balances  a liability  rather than income 
revenues on such products result from the mortality and administrative fees charged to policyholder balances in addition to surrender charges assessed at the time of surrender as explained above 
such costs of insurance  expense charges  and surrender fees are recognized as revenue as earned 
in addition  the company has adopted policy designs with the characteristic of having higher expense charges during the first policy year than in renewal years 
under sfas  the excess of these charges are reported as unearned revenue 
the unearned revenue is then amortized into income over the life of the policy using the same assumptions and factors used to amortize capitalized acquisition costs 
interest credited to policyholder balances is shown as a part of benefit expenses 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  certain costs directly associated with the issuance of new policies are deferred and amortized over the lives of the policies 
these costs are defined as deferred policy acquisition costs and are shown in the asset section of the balance sheet of the company 
capitalized acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the business at a constant rate  based on the present value of the estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the business 
sfas requires that estimates of expected gross profits used as a basis for amortization be evaluated on a regular basis  and the total amortization to date be adjusted as a charge or credit to earnings if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates be revised 
thus  variations in the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs  from one period to the next  are a normal aspect of universal life insurance business and are generally attributed to the recognition of current and emerging experience in accordance with the principles of sfas annuity products  of which the company currently has a minor amount  are recorded in similar fashion to universal life products 
considerations received by the company are credited to the annuity account balances which are shown as a liability in the balance sheet 
interest is credited to these accounts as well and shown as an expense of the company 
income is derived primarily from surrender charges on this type product 
an additional source of income to the company is investment revenue 
the company invests those funds deposited by policy holders of universal life and annuity products in debt and equity securities in order to earn interest and dividend income  a portion of which is credited back to the policyholders 
interest rates and maturities of the company s investment portfolio play a part in determining the interest rates credited to policyholders 
product profitability is affected by several different factors  such as mortality experience actual versus expected  interest rate spreads excess interest earned over interest credited to policyholders and controlling policy acquisition costs and other costs of operation 
the results of any one reporting period may be significantly affected by the level of death claims or other policyholder benefits incurred due to the company s relatively small size

new business written was  and million in face value for  and  respectively 
the company s new market is known as the final expense market 
this product is a traditional endowment policy designed to help offset the financial burdens associated with the death of a family member and targets the needs of senior citizens 
of the policies written in represent this new product 
recruiting new field sales representatives is directed at this new plan 
policies issued in this market are of a lesser face value than those of the universal life market 
that being the case  the face amount of insurance appears to have declined  however the actual number of policies issued increased 
in and  the company issued approximately  new policies 
premium and policy charges for was million  was million  at million 
while policy production was up for and  premium and policy charges went down 
premium and policy charges for were million 
several factors have combined to create this decline 
continued lapsation in the universal life book of business has resulted in reduced revenues in administrative and mortality fees 
new production has not increased as significantly as would be needed to be beneficial and the new product currently being marketed has lower premiums than those of the universal life product 
surrender fee income in was consistent with the amount of surrender fee income is dependent upon the duration and value of the policies lapsing 
should the policies be in their early years  the fee is high  however  limited to the value in the policy which is smaller in the early years 
the older policies have lower surrender fees and greater account values from which to collect those fees 
the balance of the decline in  and premium and policy charges is related to the unlocking  for current and future experience  of unearned premium 
unearned premium essentially represents the excess first year charges in the policy 
with the advice and assistance of our consulting actuaries  each year the company reviews its current experience rates for mortality  credited interest spreads  lapse rates  surrender fees and the like  and adjusts its amortization of deferred acquisition costs and unearned premium to the appropriate levels for both the current experience and anticipated future experience 
this is an ongoing refinement process 
increased investment in debt securities coupled with reduced expenses for student loan processing are responsible for the net yield in and net yield in the company continues to review its investment strategies to increase its earned interest rate 
as a part of this process of review and refinement  the company sold its entire stock portfolio just prior to year end this created a significant increase in realized gains for the resulting funds were invested in a more aggressive stock market fund which created an increased yield for the company in additional changes in the company s holdings are being planned for annuity  death and other benefits increased in this expense line is a combination of several expenses with death claims  annuity benefits and surrender benefits comprising the most significant portion of the total line 
in each of these expenses increased with death claims representing the largest increase 
a significant increase or decrease in death claims in any given year can have a marked impact on the results of operations in a small company 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in by as compared to a increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is a continuous refinement process which relates to current experience in connection with revenues  mortality gains and losses  credited interest rate spreads  expense charges and surrender charges 
the change in the rate of premium liabilities is due to unlocking for current and future experience based on the results of the changing experience encountered as required under fas operating expenses for the company were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
new products and lead programs are responsible for the increased operating costs of and the lead generation program used to introduce and promote the new product was not without cost
