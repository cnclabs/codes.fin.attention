as a result of this expansion  the company will continue to incur significant expansion and start up costs in the first quarter of additionally in the fourth quarter of  the company restructured its mortgage loan division 
because of this restructuring  the company anticipates that loan origination volume will be lower in the first quarter of compared to the last few quarters of due to the anticipated higher cost levels and lower volumes  the company expects to incur a significant loss in the first quarter of while the above changes will have a negative impact on earnings in the first quarter of  the long term benefits of these changes are expected to outweigh this negative impact 
in order to concentrate effort on the larger retail mortgage operation homegold r  the company has determined to pursue the divestiture of its smaller retail mortgage origination subsidiary  sterling lending corp 
slc 
this subsidiary was started in june and has originated only a small percentage of total retail loans 
this company s first year start up cost resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million in a primary focus of the company in  in addition to growing its retail mortgage loan origination business  was to increase its serviced loan portfolio 
the company s total serviced loans receivable increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in the serviced mortgage loan portfolio has resulted from both the company s decision to enter the retail loan origination business and the increase in both the loan volume from existing and new mortgage bankers 
small business loans have increased due to the opening of additional offices  an increase in the number of commercial loan brokers  which refer loans to the small business loan division  and new product offerings

operating cash flow the company expects to continue to operate on a negative cash flow basis due to the level of cash required to fund the increases in the volume of loans purchased and originated 
currently  the company s primary operating cash uses include the funding of i mortgage loan originations and purchases pending their securitization or sale  ii interest expense on cii investor savings notes cii notes  senior unsecured debt and its warehouse credit facilities credit facilities  iii fees  expenses  overcollateralization and tax payments incurred in connection with the securitization program and iv ongoing administrative and other operating expenses 
the company s primary operating sources of cash are i cash gains from sale of sba loan participations and whole loan mortgage loan sales 
ii cash payments of contractual and ancillary servicing revenues received by the company in its capacity as servicer for securitized and subserviced loans  nterest income on loans receivable and certain cash balances  iv fee income received in connection with its retail mortgage loan originations  and v excess cash flow received in each period with respect to interest only and residual certifica creating negative cash flow is the requirement to provide overcollateralization of loans as credit enhancement on the mortgage securitization transactions 
this will continue to negatively impact the company s cash flow as additional mortgage securitizations are completed in the future  unless the company decides to alter its securitization structures or sell its residual interests in the securitization trusts 
the company reduces the negative cash flow impact from the overcollateralization of loans included in securitizations by continuing to sell whole loans on a cash basis 
cash flow is also enhanced by the generation of loan fees in its retail mortgage loan operation and the utilization of a wholesale loan origination strategy whereby loans are generally funded at par  rather than at the significant premiums typically associated with a correspondent based strategy

the remaining increased costs for the mortgage loan division in the fourth quarter was due to additional expansion in the other three homegold r regional operating centers  additional corporate infrastructure for mis and training  and continued enhancements and expansion of the portfolio management department 
these expansions were partially performed in anticipation of meeting increased origination estimates 
origination volume  however  levelled off in the fourth quarter of  which combined with the continued expansion  contributed to the decreased operating margins 
the company anticipates its efficiency ratios for loans originated per originator to decrease in the first quarter of as a result of the company s reorganization and personnel changes  and accordingly will continue to have higher costs relative to revenue during the first part of management plans to improve these efficiency ratios  both through evaluating and improving loans originated per originator as well as to cut operating costs where possible to improve operating efficiencies by the end of results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher level of revenues resulted principally from increases in interest income  servicing income  and gain on sale of loans

summary of allowance for credit losses on owned portfolio at and for the year ended december  in thousands allowance for credit losses at beginning of period    net charge offs    provision charged to expense    securitization transfers   allowance for credit losses at the end of the period    the company considers its allowance for credit losses to be adequate in view of the company s loss experience and the secured nature of most of the company s outstanding loans 
although management considers the allowance appropriate and adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for credit losses or that additional increases in the allowance for possible credit losses will not be required 
in securitization transactions  the interest only  subordinate and or residual certificates bear the risk of default for the entire pool of securitized loans to the extent of such certificates value 
accordingly  the value of the interest only  subordinate and or residual certificates retained by the company would be impaired to the extent losses on the securitized loans exceed the amount estimated when determining the residual cash flows

the company s policy is to generally place a loan on non accrual status after it becomes days past due  if collection in full is questionable 
collection efforts on charged off loans continue until the obligation is satisfied or until it is determined that such obligation is not collectible or the cost of continued collection efforts would exceed the potential recovery 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
management monitors securitized pool delinquencies using a static pool analysis by month by pool balance 
since these pools are new  it is anticipated that the delinquencies will ramp up during the first one to two years 
current year results are not necessarily indicative of future performance

average serviced loans have been determined by using beginning and ending balances for the period presented except that the and averages are calculated based on the daily averages for small business loan division and auto loan division and monthly averages for the mortgage loan division rather than the beginning and ending balances 
over the last several years  and more acutely in  the company has expanded rapidly 
the reduction to net charge offs and loans past due as a percentage of total serviced mortgage loans is due  in part  to the increased origination volume 
the company anticipates that its total charge offs and delinquencies will generally be higher than they were at december  as the portfolio becomes more seasoned 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business requires continued access to short and long term sources of debt financing and equity capital 
the company s cash requirements arise from loan originations and purchases  repayments of debt upon maturity  payments of operating and interest expenses  expansion activities and capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  sales of the loans it originates and purchases  proceeds from the sale of cii notes  borrowings under the credit facilities and proceeds from securitization of loans 
while the company believes that such sources of funds will be adequate to meet its liquidity requirements  no assurance of such fact may be given

this structure utilizes a real estate investment trust reit and allows sales treatment for financial reporting purposes  but debt treatment for tax purposes 
accordingly  this structure eliminates current taxes payable on the book gain  while maintaining the structural efficiency of tranching  previously only available through a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic transaction 
additionally  under this structure  the company has distributed 
ownership in the reit to a certain class of employees  with an initial value of approximately  in securitizations  the company sells the loans that it originates or purchases to a trust for cash  and records certain assets and income based upon the difference between all principal and interest received from the loans sold and i all principal and interest required to be passed through to the asset backed bond investors  ii all excess contractual servicing fees  iii other recurring fees and iv an estimate of losses on the loans collectively  the excess cash flow 
at the time of the securitization  the company estimates these amounts based upon a declining principal balance of the underlying loans  adjusted by an estimated prepayment and loss rate  and capitalizes these amounts using a discount rate that market participants would use for similar financial instruments 
these capitalized assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet as interest only and residual certificates as interest only strip securities  investment in asset backed securities and restricted cash  and are aggregated and reported on the income statement as gain on sale of loans  after being reduced increased by the costs of securitization and any hedge losses gains 
the company retains the right to service loans it securitizes 
fees for servicing loans are based on a stipulated percentage generally per annum on mortgage loans and per annum on sba loans of the unpaid principal balance of the associated loans 
on its mortgage loan securitizations  the company has recognized a servicing asset in addition to its gain on sale of loans 
the servicing asset is calculated as the present value of the expected future net servicing income in excess of adequate compensation for a substitute servicer based on common industry assumptions and the company s historical experience 
these factors include default and prepayment speeds

the company uses a curve based on various cpr levels throughout the pool s life  based on its estimate of prepayment performance  as outlined in the table above 
typically  high ltv loans approximately of the loans in the company s securitization transactions are priced at a slower cpr than traditional home equity loans to cpr and are expected to have less prepayment volatility under changing interest rate scenarios 
based on percentage of original principal balance  subject to step down provisions after months 
each of the company s mortgage loan securitizations have been credit enhanced by an insurance policy provided through a monoline insurance company to receive ratings of aaa from moody s investors services  inc moody s and aaa from standard poor s ratings group  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc standard poor s 
the company plans to continue to complete the quarterly securitization of a substantial portion of its mortgage loans  principally because the company believes that securitization is potentially more profitable than whole loan sales and because the company as servicer wants to maintain the relationship with its loan customers 
however  the company may alter this strategy based on cash flow requirements 
the company expects to begin receiving excess cash flow on its mortgage loan securitizations approximately months from the date of securitization  although this time period may be shorter or longer depending upon the securitization structure and performance of the loans securitized 
prior to such time  the monoline insurer requires a reserve provision to be created within the securitization trust which uses excess cash flow to retire the securitization bond debt until the spread between the outstanding principal balance of the loans in the securitization trust and the securitization bond debt equals a specified percentage depending on the structure of the securitization of the initial securitization principal balance the overcollateralization limit 
once this overcollateralization limit is met  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
the company begins to receive regular monthly servicing fees in the month following securitization 
the company originally used basis points annual losses on its first three mortgage securitization transactions  but in the fourth quarter of  changed its loss assumption to basis points per annum as a result of projected higher than anticipated delinquencies within the securitization pools 
the company also modified the estimated prepayment speeds on all of its mortgage loan securitization transactions to peak at cpr  up from the deals pricing speeds of hep on the first two deals and hep on the second two securitizations 
actual prepayment speeds have been running below these assumptions  and the trusts have experienced virtually no losses to date 
the impact in the fourth quarter of the changes in these assumptions was to reduce fair value of these residual interests by million 
these changes were the result of the company s attempt to refine the modeling of the anticipated cash flows to better match expected future cash flows 
the following sets forth facts and assumptions used by the company in arriving at the valuation of the interest only strip securities  asset backed securities and restricted cash relating to its unguaranteed sba loan securitizations at december  june november january december loans securitized     average stated principal balance     weighted average spread over wall street journal prime rate weighted average original term to stated maturity months months months months weighted average ltv spread under prime rate estimated annual losses annual servicing fee discount rate applied to cash flow after spread account prepayment speed initial cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr peak cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr tail cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr cpr ramp period months months months months cpr peak period months months months months cpr tail begins months months months months annual trustee fee     initial spread account required final spread account required subordinate piece retained the gains recognized into income resulting from securitization transactions vary depending on the assumptions used  the specific characteristics of the underlying loan pools  and the structure of the transaction 
the company believes the assumptions it has used are appropriate and reasonable 
the company assesses the carrying value of its interest only strip securities and servicing assets for impairment 
there can be no assurance that the company s estimates used to determine the gain on sale of loans  interest only strip securities  and servicing assets valuations will remain appropriate for the life of each securitization 
if actual loan prepayments or defaults exceed the company s estimates  the carrying value of the company s interest only strip securities and or servicing assets may be decreased through a charge against earnings in the period management recognizes the disparity 
accounting considerations in june  fasb issued sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  this statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial reporting 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement establishes standards for the method that public entities report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about product and services  geographical areas and major customers 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial reporting 
tax considerations the nol as a result of the operating losses incurred by the company under prior management in its discontinued transportation segment operations  the company generated an nol 
federal tax laws provide that net operating loss carryforwards are restricted or eliminated upon certain changes of control 
applicable federal tax laws provide that a change of control  which is calculated over a rolling three year period  would cause the loss of substantially all of the nol 
although the calculation of the change of control is factually difficult to determine  the company believes that it has had a maximum cumulative change of control of during the relevant three year period 
during  the company eliminated its valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million at december  management based the decision to eliminate the valuation based on its belief that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset  given the levels of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets would be realized 
this resulted in the company recognizing a deferred tax benefit for of million 
the company had a federal nol of approximately million remaining at december  hedging activities the company s profitability may be directly affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
while the company monitors interest rates and employs a strategy designed to hedge some of the risks associated with changes in interest rates  no assurance can be given that the company s results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected during periods of fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate hedging strategy currently includes shorting interest rate futures and treasury forwards  and entering into interest rate lock agreements 
since the interest rates on the company s warehouse lines of credit used to fund and acquire loans are variable and the rates charged on loans the company originates are fixed  increases in the interest rates after loans are originated and prior to their sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the ultimate sale of the company s loans will fix the spread between the interest rates paid by borrowers and the interest rates paid to investors in securitization transactions with respect to such loans  although increases in interest rates may narrow the potential spread that existed at the time the loans were originated by the company 
without hedging these loans  increases in interest rates prior to sale of the loans may reduce the gain on securitized loan sales earned by the company 
impact of inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the area of loan originations and can have a substantial effect on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
profitability may be directly affected by the level and fluctuation in interest rates which affect the company s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of its borrowings 
the profitability of the company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate and purchase loans and affect the mix of first and second mortgage loan products 
generally  first mortgage production increases relative to second mortgage production in response to low interest rates and second mortgage production increases relative to first mortgage production during periods of high interest rates 
a significant decline in interest rates could decrease the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio by increasing the level of loan prepayments 
additionally  to the extent servicing rights  interest only and residual classes of certificates have been capitalized on the books of the company  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the company to write down the value of such servicing rights  interest only and residual certificates  adversely impacting earnings 
fluctuating interest rates may also affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sales and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse facilities 
year a critical issue has emerged in the financial community and for businesses in general regarding whether existing computer programs and systems  many of which were designed to recognize only two digits in the date field  can be modified in time to accommodate four digits in the date field as is necessary to properly distinguish dates on and after january  from dates between january  and december  the upcoming change in the century is expected to cause many computer applications to create erroneous results or fail completely if the problem is not corrected 
the company has established a year team to oversee the identification  correction  reprogramming and testing of the systems and software applications used by the company and the companies with which it interacts electronically for year compliance as well as to identify other possible risks associated with the year problem 
the company has hired a year coordinator to head this project 
the company has completed a hardware  software and vendor interface inventory to identify all components for testing 
it is in the process of replacing and modifying noncompliant systems of which it is aware 
the company has sent letters to vendors to request information on year compliance and testing arrangements 
a formal test plan is being refined and the company currently plans to test its systems prior to december  testing of internally developed software has begun 
a risk assessment is being developed by the year team as part of the project 
this assessment is expected to be completed by july  although the company has not yet fully evaluated the cost of modifying and replacing its systems aimed at achieving year compliance  such costs are not currently expected to be material to the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the inability of the company or the parties with whom it electronically interacts to successfully address year issues could result in interruptions in the company s business and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
