item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
references to years are to fiscal years ended june overview based on worldwide sales  the company believes it is the largest photomask manufacturer in the world 
the company sells its products to approximately customers in different countries 
essentially all of the company s sales are to customers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the company manufactures a broad range of photomasks based on customer supplied design data 
the company also manufactures photoblanks and pellicles  the principal components of photomasks  primarily for internal consumption 
the company operates globally with established manufacturing facilities in north america  europe and asia 
prior to the company s initial public offering on june   it was a wholly owned subsidiary of dupont 
therefore  the company s historical results prior to such date are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved if the company had been independent 
the company s sales increased from million in to million in the increase of over was primarily the result of a number of recent trends in the semiconductor industry which have fueled growth in design activity  including i increasing customization of semiconductor designs  ii growing complexity of semiconductor devices  iii decreasing feature size of semiconductor designs  and iv the proliferation of semiconductor applications 
the impact of these trends has been to increase the importance of photomask technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
sales increased from million in to million in the strength of the us dollar against the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the german mark and french franc  adversely impacted sales by approximately million in and thus adversely impacted sales growth in as compared to the previous year 
due to the capital intensive nature of photomask manufacturing operations  at a given threshold of manufacturing capacity  a high proportion of the company s operating costs remain relatively constant as sales volume increases or decreases 
to the extent that the company has under utilized production capacity  operating profit increases or decreases significantly as sales volume increases or decreases 
in the early s  the company had excess capacity 
therefore  as sales increased in and  costs associated with manufacturing remained relatively unchanged and the company s operating profit during such periods benefited 
as occurred during  the company anticipates that operating costs will continue to increase as it adds capacity to position itself for future growth 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial information expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
year ended june  sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense operating profit interest income expense exchange loss income before income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before minority interest and extraordinary item minority interest in loss of majority owned joint venture income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales 
sales are comprised primarily of photomask sales to semiconductor manufacturers 
sales increased from million in to million in sales in north america and europe increased from million and million in to million and million in sales in asia decreased from million in to million in a continued increase in the demand for advanced photomasks  which have higher average selling prices  was a primary contributor to the overall increase in sales during these periods 
this shift in demand reflects what the company believes to be a continued trend toward higher utilization of complex semiconductor devices with finer line widths 
product mix related average selling price increases contributed approximately one half of the revenue growth in the balance of the revenue growth came from increased unit volume 
the strength of the us dollar against the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the german mark and french franc  adversely impacted sales by approximately million in and thus adversely impacted sales growth in as compared to the previous year 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of material  labor  depreciation and overhead 
cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in resulting primarily from higher costs associated with increased sales  costs related to new facilities and costs related to continued capacity expansions at existing facilities 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased from in to in the percentage of sales increase was primarily due to margin compression as a result of the strength of the us dollar  costs related to new facilities and costs related to continued capacity expansions at existing facilities 
as the company adds capacity to position itself for future growth  it will incur additional costs related to new facilities and costs related to capacity expansions at existing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries of sales personnel  marketing expense  general and administrative expense and product distribution expense 
since january   general and administrative expense includes fees incurred by the company under administrative service agreements with dupont  the company s majority stockholder  and certain dupont subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million in as a result of reductions in discretionary spending including reduced incentive compensation expense 
the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in the future 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation  engineering related costs and the company s share of costs of the limited liability company discussed below 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to the company s joint venture participation with advanced micro devices  micron technology and motorola in a limited liability company called the rtc which was formed to develop advanced photomask technology and pilot line fabricate leading edge photomasks 
the company believes that  through its participation in the rtc  it will be able to help meet the future technology needs of the semiconductor industry for advanced photomasks 
there can be no assurance that the rtc will yield results that are favorable to the company 
the company anticipates that research and development expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future reflecting the company s strategy of advancing its technological leadership 
however  there can be no assurance that such expenditures will enable the company to develop new technologies or to maintain its technological leadership 
interest income 
interest income was million in and million in interest income results from short term investment of the company s cash balances 
exchange loss 
exchange loss consists of net gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the company s accounts denominated in non us currencies into us dollars  which is the company s functional currency 
exchange loss was million in compared to million in primarily due to fluctuations of the us dollar against the korean won  german mark and french franc 
exchange loss is net of the impact of hedging activities designed to reduce exchange rate exposure 
provision for income taxes 
the company s tax expense has been determined in accordance with fas and is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which the company operates 
the company s operations in korea are subject to a government granted tax exemption 
the company will continue to enjoy the full benefits of the tax exemption in korea until and a partial benefit thereafter until the tax exemption terminates in minority interest in loss of majority owned joint venture 
the minority interest impact of the company s joint venture in china was million in compared to million in minority interest reflects the partner s share of losses from the joint venture 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales 
sales increased from million in to million in sales in north america  europe and asia increased from million  million and million in to million  million and million in a continued increase in the demand for advanced photomasks  which have higher average selling prices  was a primary contributor to the increase in sales during this period 
this shift in demand reflects what the company believes to be a continued trend toward higher utilization of complex semiconductor devices with finer linewidths 
the increase in sales during this period also reflects the overall increase in demand for photomasks 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in resulting primarily from higher costs associated with increased sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to continued improvements in capacity utilization including increased use of internally sourced photoblanks and pellicles 
selling  general and administrative expense 
prior to january   general and administrative expense principally included allocated costs for services provided by centralized dupont organizations 
these allocated costs are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had been independent 
since january   general and administrative expense includes fees incurred by the company under administrative service agreements with dupont  the company s majority stockholder  and certain dupont subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased from in to in selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increases were due largely to increases in selling expenses corresponding to increased sales and increases in incentive compensation expense corresponding to increases in earnings 
research and development expense 
the company s allocated share of dupont s central research and development was million in such allocations terminated december  research and development expense  excluding dupont allocations  increased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense increased slightly compared to the prior year 
these increases reflect the company s joint venture participation in the rtc 
interest income expense 
interest expense was million in and interest income was million in the primary source of interest expense in was the company s master note arrangements with dupont 
on june   dupont contributed the million balance outstanding on the master notes to the company as a capital contribution 
interest income results from short term investment of the company s cash balances 
exchange loss 
exchange loss was million in and million in the loss is primarily due to fluctuations of the us dollar against the german mark  french franc and korean won 
exchange loss is net of the impact of hedging activities designed to reduce exchange rate exposure 
provision for income taxes 
prior to the initial public offering  tax expense was determined and allocated to the company by applying the separate taxpayer approach outlined in fas under this approach  the company had net operating loss carry forwards in the us and europe  some of which became fully utilized during the company s operations in korea are subject to a government granted tax exemption 
the company will continue to enjoy the full benefits of the tax exemption in korea until and a partial benefit thereafter until the tax exemption terminates in in actuality  the company s results prior to the initial public offering were included in consolidated tax returns filed by dupont and the tax benefit of prior year losses was realized by dupont 
since the initial public offering  tax expense has been determined in accordance with fas and is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which the company operates 
minority interest in loss of majority owned joint venture 
the minority interest impact of the company s joint venture in china was million in compared to million in  reflecting increased pre operating losses from  and partner funding of  the joint venture 
extraordinary item 
in january  the company sold its entire investment in etec common stock 
aggregate net proceeds from the sale of million were used in operations 
the company realized a million gain on the sale 
the related provision for income taxes was million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million at june  and million at june  the decrease in working capital is due principally to lower cash balances  as partially offset by higher accounts receivable  resulting from higher sales and a slow down in payment terms principally from customers in asia  and inventory balances  resulting partially from the acquisition of inventory described below  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june  and million at june  cash provided by operations was million in and million in cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the cash used in investing activities in is the net of cash proceeds from the sale of the company s investment in etec common stock million and capital expenditures million 
the cash used in investing activities in is a combination of capital expenditures and payment made with respect to the company s strategic alliance with hyundai whereby the company purchased selected photomask manufacturing equipment located at hyundai s captive photomask manufacturing facility in kanam  korea and entered into a five year sales and supply agreement with hyundai 
the company acquired  through its korean subsidiary  approximately million of equipment and approximately million in inventory 
consideration for the assets was principally cash  and was partially financed by million in borrowings on the company s credit facility with dupont 
in recent periods  the company s most significant use of cash in investing activities has been capital expenditures 
management expects capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
capital expenditures have been and will be used primarily to expand the company s manufacturing capacity and advance the company s technical capability 
the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into other joint venture arrangements that could complement or expand the company s business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to the company s working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in and  for  primarily reflects net borrowings on the company s credit agreement 
the company and dupont have entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement pursuant to which dupont has agreed to provide a credit facility to the company in an aggregate amount of million 
the credit agreement expires in and any loans thereunder will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
at the company s option  advances under the credit agreement are convertible into term loans with maturities up to seven years 
to date  the company has borrowed a maximum of million under the credit facility and at june  borrowings of million were outstanding under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains  among other things  covenants restricting the company s ability to incur additional debt 
the company s ongoing cash requirements will be for capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development and working capital 
the company has executed an agreement with united microelectronics corporation to establish a joint venture to produce photomasks in taiwan  has announced that it plans to build a new photomask production facility in singapore  has begun construction on a new photomask production facility in gresham  oregon  has announced that it has entered into an agreement with etec to upgrade its existing mebes registered trademark electron beam pattern generation tools and has recently announced plans to acquire hewlett packard s photomask manufacturing business 
these plans reflect a significant capital investment over the next five years 
management believes that cash provided by operations and the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next months 
based on its current operating plans  the company will require external financing from time to time to fund its capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the additional financing required to fund these capital investments on reasonable terms  or at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available upon expiration of the credit agreement or that alternative sources of funding will be available if the company s borrowing requirements exceed the facility 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  even if funding is available  the terms thereof will be attractive to the company 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas and fas neither fas is expected to have a material impact on the company 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas which is also not expected to have a material impact on the company 
non us operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative value of currencies and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative value of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s financial statements reflect remeasurement of items denominated in non us currencies to non us dollars  the company s functional currency 
exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
the company monitors its exchange rate exposure and attempts to reduce such exposure by hedging 
the company has entered into korean won and french franc forward contracts designed to reduce such exposure 
there can be no assurance that such forward contracts or any other hedging activity will be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of the company s exchange rate exposure 
there can be no assurance that such risks will not have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and results of operations in the future 
many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a very wide variety of applications will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the century change 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures and has established a project team to address year risks 
the project team has coordinated the identification of and will coordinate the implementation of changes to computer hardware and software applications that will attempt to ensure availability and integrity of the company s information systems and the reliability of its operational systems and manufacturing processes 
the company is also assessing the potential overall impact of the impending century change on its business  results of operations and financial position 
the company has reviewed its information and operational systems and manufacturing processes in order to identify those products  services or systems that are not year compliant 
as a result of this review  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain information and operational systems so they will be year compliant 
these modifications and replacements are being  and will continue to be  made in conjunction with the company s overall systems initiatives 
the total cost of these year compliance activities  estimated at less than million  has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company expects to complete its year project during based on available information  the company does not believe any material exposure to significant business interruption exist as a result of year compliance issues 
accordingly  the company has not adopted any formal contingency plan in the event its year project is not completed in a timely manner 
these costs and the timing in which the company plans to complete its year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant year problems  that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
the company also faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis do not comply with year requirements 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to these third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services or systems that meet the year requirements on a timely basis  or in the event year issues prevent such third parties from timely delivery of products or services required by the company  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent year issues cause significant delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase the company s products or services  the company s business  results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk non us operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including fluctuation in the relative value of currencies 
the company monitors its exchange rate exposure and attempts to reduce such exposure by hedging 
the company has entered into korean won and french franc forward contracts designed to reduce such exposure 
at june   the company held forward contracts with a notional amount of approximately million  a carrying amount of approximately million and an unrealized loss of approximately million 
the strength of the us dollar against the korean won  and to a lesser extent  the german mark and french franc  adversely impacted sales by approximately million in and thus adversely impacted sales growth in as compared to the previous year
