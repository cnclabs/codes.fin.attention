certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations may be deemed forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview the company is pursuing a strategy of focusing on its more profitable businesses and concentrating on businesses and product lines in niche markets where the company has established or can establish a position as a market leader 
in addition  the company is seeking to improve its liquidity and profits through liquidation of selected assets that are on its balance sheet and on which it is not realizing an acceptable return nor does it have the potential to do so 
in this connection  the company is developing a plan  subject to the approval of the board of directors  to dispose of all non core and or non earning assets 
the company has been concentrating on reshaping the automotive products business by the liquidation of certain of their assets that don t have the potential to earn an acceptable return and focusing on product lines that management believes have strategic advantages within select niche markets 
the company continues to explore its alternatives to accomplish these goals 
in addition  the company has been liquidating certain slow moving inventory in the industrial products business in the ordinary course of business 
it is the present intention of the company to limit this business to lines of machine tools which should result in an acceptable return on capital employed 
certain statements contained in this overview are forward looking statements  and the results thereof could differ materially from such statements if the company is unable to liquidate such assets in a reasonable period or on reasonable terms  and if able to liquidate such assets  it may not be able to improve profits in the automotive products business or have an acceptable return on capital employed in these businesses if general economic conditions deteriorate drastically from the environment these businesses currently operate in or these businesses are unable to meet competitive pressures in the market place which restrict these businesses from manufacturing or purchasing and selling their products at acceptable prices

chemical business the company has grown the chemical business through the expansion of its el dorado facility and the acquisition of new agricultural distribution centers in key geographical markets that are freight logical to the el dorado facility 
during the period from december  through december   the net investment in assets of the chemical business was increased from million to million primarily due to the construction of additional capacity to benefit future periods 
beginning in  the results of operations of the chemical business have been adversely impacted by the high cost of anhydrous ammonia 
from its most recent cyclical low in through  the average gulf coast price the spot price of anhydrous ammonia was approximately per ton 
during and in each of the years since  a tightness in supply developed which resulted in an increase in the spot price of anhydrous ammonia to an average of approximately per ton 
the company believes that the tightness in supply of anhydrous ammonia that emerged in was a result of increased industrial usage as the us economy grew  a net consolidation of the domestic capacity and a disruption in supply coming from the former soviet union 
although prices for anhydrous ammonia vary considerably from month to month  the annual average price has remained high for each of the last three years 
the company currently purchases approximately  tons of anhydrous ammonia per year under two contracts  both effective as of january  the company s purchase price of anhydrous ammonia under these contracts can be higher or lower than the spot price of anhydrous ammonia 
the higher prices have been partially passed on to customers  however  the entire cost increase could not be offset resulting in lower gross profit margins during each of the periods since the increase 
the company believes there is approximately million tons of additional capacity being constructed in the western hemisphere scheduled for completion in and the company believes this additional capacity may contribute to a decline in the market price of anhydrous ammonia 
during  the company undertook construction of the dsn plant 
the dsn plant began operations in  but due to certain mechanical and design problems  production of concentrated nitric acid during the twelve months ended december  was limited to an average of tons per day  assuming days of annual production or of the stated capacity of tons per day 
the limitations on production resulted in significant fixed costs being expended as period costs during the second half of  and the first half of  rather than being absorbed as cost of product being produced and sold 
in addition  significant amounts were expended for engineering  consulting  and other costs to bring the dsn plant up to the stated capacity 
during the annual maintenance turnaround in september  management implemented corrective actions which it believes allow the dsn plant to operate at its stated capacity  depending upon customer specifications  and to fully absorb the costs and produce a quality product 
in early october  the dsn plant was restarted and is currently operating at approximately tons per day due to inventory constraints and customer specifications 
during july  a subsidiary of the company entered into an agreement with bayer corporation whereby the company s subsidiaries would act as agent to construct a nitric acid plant located within bayer s baytown  texas chemical plant complex 
this plant  when constructed  will be operated by the company s subsidiary and will supply nitric acid for bayer s polyurethane units under a long term supply contract 
management estimates that  after the initial startup phase of operations at the plant  at full production capacity based on terms of the bayer agreement and on current market conditions  the plant should generate approximately million in annual revenues 
construction is scheduled to be completed by the end of the chemical business australian subsidiary  tes  results of operations have been adversely affected due to the recent economic developments in certain countries in asia 
these economic developments in asia have had a negative impact on the mining industry in australia which tes services 
if these adverse economic conditions in asia continue for an extended period of time  such could have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations for climate control the climate control business manufactures and sells a broad range of hydronic fan coil  air handling  air conditioning  heating  water source heat pumps  and dehumidification products targeted to both commercial and residential new building construction and renovation 
the climate control business focuses on product lines in the specific niche markets of hydronic fan coils and water source heat pumps and has established a significant market share in these specific markets 
as indicated in the above table  the climate control business reported improved sales an increase of and improved operating profit for as compared to from december through december the net investment in assets of the climate control business was increased from million to million 
during this two year period  additions to property  plant and equipment were million and depreciation was approximately million 
automotive and industrial products businesses as indicated in the above table  during  and  respectively  the automotive and industrial products businesses recorded combined sales of million  million and million  respectively  and reported operating losses as defined above of million  million  and million in and  and respectively

gross profit gross profit decreased 
million and was of net sales for  compared to of net sales for the gross profit percentage declined in the automotive products and chemical businesses  but improved in the climate control and industrial products businesses

these increased costs in were partially offset by a reduction in cost of sales of million through recapture of manufacturing variances of the chemical business in the form of business interruption insurance settlements 
the primary reasons for the decline in gross profit percentage in the automotive products business were i less favorable customer mix ie decreased sales to higher margin retail customers  and increased sales to original equipment manufacturer oem customers which are lower margin customers  and ii increases in manufacturing expenses in excess of increases in production cost absorption attributable to new product lines that have been developed 
these gross profit declines have been partially offset by gross profit percentage increases due to sales of machine tools carrying a higher gross profit percentage in the industrial products business and increased absorption of costs due to higher production volumes and focus on sales of more profitable product lines in the climate control business

within sg a of the chemical business  lower provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable in were offset by increased expenses at the company s australian subsidiary in anticipation of sustaining a higher level of business activity 
the increase in the climate control business sg a was the result of increases in sales personnel costs to support higher sales in future periods  additional information technology personnel to support management information systems changes and higher freight costs due to a change in sales mix toward greater domestic sales which carry a higher sg a percent 
the increase in the automotive products business was due to lower sales and increased advertising expenses expected to benefit future periods 
the decrease in the industrial products business resulted from lower bad debt expenses and lower advertising expenses compounded by higher sales 
in addition to the variances described above  approximately million of the total sg a increase of million is due to the operations of the tower in as discussed elsewhere in this report and approximately million is due to increased legal fees  settlement accruals and loss reserves in over to assert the company s position in various legal proceedings  joint ventures and debt guarantees as discussed more completely elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

gross profit gross profit decreased 
million and was of net sales for  compared to of net sales for the gross profit percentage declined in the automotive products  chemical  and climate control businesses 
the gross profit of the chemical business  was adversely affected due to the continued high cost of anhydrous ammonia as discussed above and higher production costs due to unabsorbed overhead costs resulting from excessive downtime at the chemical business el dorado  arkansas plant complex related to modifications made to install air emissions abatement equipment and resolve problems associated with mechanical failures at the dsn plant 
the climate control business gross profit percentage decreased due to production inefficiencies and decreased absorption of costs due to lower production volumes in certain product lines of this business

the increase in accounts receivable is due to increased sales primarily in the climate control business see results of operations for discussion of increase in sales 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to an increase at the chemical business to support anticipated sales increases 
these increases were offset by inventory reductions in the automotive and industrial products businesses resulting from liquidation of excessive inventories 
inventory in the automotive and industrial products businesses decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from cash flow from financing activities becoming available to reduce accounts payable 
cash flow from investing and financing activities cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  included million in capital expenditures
