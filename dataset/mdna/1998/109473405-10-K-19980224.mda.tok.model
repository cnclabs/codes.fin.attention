net income pro forma for first two quarters of the company s sales are influenced by a number of seasonal factors associated with consumer electronics and retail sales which tend to result in increased volume in the latter part of the calendar year 
the overall growth of the company s business has reduced the impact of such factors on the company s operating results 
however  seasonality contributes to the increase in the company s sales in the fourth quarter of its fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund increased levels of accounts receivable and inventories resulting from its growth and to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and contract financing receivables 
the company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations  vendor financing  bank borrowings  proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of equity securities 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to working capital of approximately million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and contract financing receivables and a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in inventory 
this increase in working capital was funded by the company s august public offering and by bank borrowings 
net cash used by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used by operating activities for was primarily attributable to an increase in working capital exclusive of the increase in contract financing receivables  partially offset by the net income earned 
net cash used by investing activities was approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for the purchase of information systems equipment and software  the expansion of the company s operations center in indianapolis  indiana  the opening of a west coast operations center in sparks  nevada  the acquisitions completed in  the continued expansion of international operations and the increase in contract financing receivables  partially offset by the sale of the company s investment in certain marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the company s august public offering  borrowings under the company s credit facilities and proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  while net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to borrowings under the company s credit facility and proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securites of approximately million 
on june   the company entered into a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility with the first national bank of chicago and bank one  indiana  na  as co agents for a group of banks collectively  the banks 
the line of credit matures in june and generally bears interest  at the company s option  at i the greater of the first national bank of chicago s corporate base rate and the federal funds effective rate plus the base rate or ii the rate at which deposits in united states dollars or eurocurrencies are offered by the first national bank of chicago to first class banks in the london interbank market plus a spread ranging from to basis points based on the company s leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement plus a spread reserve  if any  and provides the company with the ability to borrow in multiple currencies and thus to use the facility for its global working capital needs 
borrowings by the company s non united states subsidiaries bear interest at various rates negotiated with the applicable lenders based on the type and term of advance selected and the prevailing interest rates of the country in which the subsidiary is domiciled 
at december   there was approximately million outstanding at interest rates ranging from to a weighted average rate of and an aggregate of million in letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility  with million of credit available 
all of the company s assets located in the united states and of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states are pledged to the banks as collateral  and the company is substantially prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness  either of which terms could  under certain circumstances  limit the company s ability to implement its expansion plans 
in addition to certain net worth and other financial covenants  the company s loan agreement with the banks limits or prohibits the company  subject to certain exceptions  from declaring or paying cash dividends  making capital distributions or other payments to stockholders  merging or consolidating with another corporation or selling all or substantially all of its assets 
in august  the company consummated a public offering of  shares of common stock by the company and an additional  shares of common stock on behalf of two stockholders the selling stockholders 
upon consummation of the offering  the selling stockholders  who were former stockholders of allied communications  resigned as members of the company s board of directors pursuant to an agreement with the company 
the proceeds to the company of approximately million net of estimated expenses were used to reduce the borrowings outstanding on its credit facility 
the company has generated five year compounded annual growth in net sales and pro forma net income through in excess of and  respectively 
in order to fund the working capital necessary for this level of growth  the company successfully raised over million of capital using an appropriate combination of both debt and equity capital 
the company anticipates that to maintain similar growth in the future  it will be necessary to continue to raise additional capital during  while maintaining appropriate leverage ratios 
the company has increasingly emphasized the sale of products on open account terms and has purchased increased levels of inventories to support an expanding customer base  which resulted in increased accounts receivable days outstanding and a decrease in inventory turns in while  in  the accounts receivable days outstanding decreased and inventory turns increased  the company continues to emphasize open account terms and maintains appropriate levels of inventory to support its expanding customer base 
in addition  the company began  in  to offer financing of inventory and receivables to certain customers under contractual arrangements 
trade accounts receivable are generated through sales to network operators  agents  resellers  dealers and retailers in the wireless communication industry and are dispersed throughout the world  including asia and the pacific rim  north america  europe  the middle east  africa and latin america 
contract financing receivables are generated through financing transactions with network operators and their agents located in the north american wireless communication market 
at december   the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million  which the company believes was adequate for the size and nature of its receivables at that date 
bad debt expense accounted for less than of the company s net sales in each of  and nevertheless  the company s accounts receivable and contract financing receivables are concentrated with network operators  agent dealers and mass retailers and delays in collection or the uncollectibility of accounts receivable or contract financing receivables could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  working capital position and results of operations 
in connection with the company s expanded operations  the company has offered open account terms to additional customers in various worldwide markets  which subjects the company to increased credit risk  particularly in foreign markets  and could require the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that the ability to offer these credit terms provides it with a competitive advantage 
the company seeks to minimize losses on credit sales by closely monitoring its customers credit worthiness and by seeking to obtain letters of credit or similar security in connection with certain open account sales 
foreign operations and foreign currency the company transacts business in worldwide markets and its operations outside of the united states have accounted for an increasing portion of the company s business 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely effected by a variety of factors  including changes in a specific country s political  economic or regulatory conditions  trade protection measures and failure or material interruption of wireless systems and services 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its assets  liabilities and results of operations denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as interest rate risk inherent in the company s debt 
a significant portion of the company s operations are located outside the united states in countries such as china including hong kong  the united kingdom  australia  sweden  south africa  the philippines and brazil and other latin america countries 
the financial statements of these operations are denominated in the local currencies of those countries 
during  the us dollar strengthened against most of these currencies resulting in translation of these financial statements into lower us dollar amounts 
the translation of the company s foreign currency denominated financial statements had less than a impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and consolidated stockholders equity in the company s subsidiaries do not typically have significant amounts of assets  liabilities or commitments that are denominated in currencies other than the respective operation s functional currency 
the company periodically utilizes derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options as well as borrowings denominated in foreign currencies to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures  with the intent of offsetting gains and losses on the financial instruments against the gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes and  at december   had no significant position in derivative instruments 
future operating results the following discussion and analysis  as well as other statements in this report on form k which are not based on historical fact  contain forward looking statements  and actual future results may differ materially 
future trends for net sales and profitability are difficult to predict due to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including  among others i business conditions and growth in the company s markets  including currency  economic and political risks in markets in which the company operates  ii availability and prices of wireless communications products  iii absorption  through sales growth  of the increasing operating costs that the company has incurred and continues to incur in connection with its expansion activities and provision of value added services  iv successful consummation and integration of future acquisitions  v continued success of strategic relationships with wireless equipment manufacturers  network operators and other providers of wireless communications logistics services  vi ability to meet the intense industry competition  vii continued access to increasing amounts of capital  and viii the highly dynamic nature of the industry in which the company participates 
the company expects net sales to continue to grow in all of its divisions and to price its products and services to obtain reasonable operating margins 
because of the dynamic nature of the industry in which the company operates and the impact of changes in the company s mix of services  future net sales and net income growth rates are difficult to estimate with precision 
the company expects its gross margin percentages to increase as the impact of the improved sales mix and value added services continues 
gross margins may be affected by product  freight and other costs  price competition and by changes in the mix of the company s products  services  geographic markets and customers 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in connection with higher sales levels 
however  the company anticipates its operating margins will increase as the growth in gross margins should exceed any growth in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 
because of the aforementioned uncertainties affecting the company s future operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future financial performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends 
impact of the year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company makes ongoing assessments of the internal readiness of its computer systems and believes that the cost of any modification required will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition  in part because the company recently implemented a comprehensive informix based information system that is year compliant 
the company has completed implementation of this system in its north america division and parts of its latin america division and plans to complete implementation of this system at all of its significant worldwide locations before the end of costs associated with the year assessment and any related correction of specific problems are expensed as incurred 
in addition  the company is assessing the readiness of third party suppliers and customers whose computer systems interact with the company s computer systems 
there is no guarantee that these third parties will timely convert their systems or that their systems will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems  however  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve any potentially significant year issues facing it  whether from within its operations or as a result of its interaction with these third parties  in a timely manner
