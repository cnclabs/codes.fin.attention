item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration and production activity has traditionally influenced demand for the company s services 
the company expanded its aviation services and related operations through its investment in bristow that was completed in december the company s investment in bristow see note c in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of this investment was influenced by its belief that the globalization of helicopter operators has begun with the recent acquisitions and consolidations completed by two of its major international competitors 
the company believes that this trend will continue and accelerate as helicopter operators seek to broaden their exposure to international markets in order to better serve their customers and increase their access and influence with financial markets  insurance markets and other suppliers 
the company also believes that these combinations and alliances will allow greater development of in house core expertise in dealing with manufacturers and suppliers to reduce direct operating costs  enhance and promote flight safety  improve efficiencies to be more competitive in the new global marketplace and provide a more fertile environment for future investment and growth opportunities 
the combined helicopter activities of air log and bristow result in an operating fleet of aircraft servicing the principal oil and gas markets of the world 
gpm s services include furnishing personnel  engineering  production operating services  paramedic services and the provision of boat and helicopter transportation of personnel and supplies between onshore bases and offshore facilities 
the company s investment in gpm was influenced by its belief that a restructuring in the united states oil and gas industry is taking place  resulting in part from the instability of oil and gas prices over the last several years 
as part of this restructuring  major oil companies have been reducing the size of their field organizations and concentrating more on larger projects such as deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore projects in various international areas 
management believes that this restructuring is creating opportunities  first  for smaller  independent oil companies as the major oil companies have been selling properties in the gulf of mexico  second  for companies providing production management services to smaller  independent oil companies  which frequently lack the personnel to operate these properties and finally for major oil companies as they transfer their focus and technical personnel to new and larger projects 
although there can be no assurances  management believes that  through gpm  the company has the opportunity to take advantage of increases in the market for oil and gas production management services that may occur over the next few years 
management also believes that the addition of the production management services business may permit the company  by providing helicopter services through the production management services business to smaller  independent companies  to enhance its market share for its helicopter transportation services in the very competitive and rapidly changing gulf of mexico environment
