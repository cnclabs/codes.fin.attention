item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview all references to years are to fiscal years ended june unless otherwise stated 
certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
all earnings per share amounts are calculated on a diluted basis unless otherwise stated 
vs 
during the past two years  mallinckrodt completed the largest acquisition in its history and divested certain businesses to improve the strategic position and focus of the company 
on august   the company acquired nellcor puritan bennett incorporated nellcor through an agreement to purchase for cash all of the outstanding shares of common stock of nellcor for per share 
the aggregate purchase price of the nellcor acquisition was approximately billion 
nellcor is the worldwide market leader in providing products that monitor  diagnose and treat respiratory impaired patients 
the product lines include pulse oximetry monitors and sensors  critical care and portable ventilators  home oxygen therapy products  sleep apnea diagnostic and therapy products  and medical gas products and distribution systems 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of nellcor have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since september  the purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
identifiable intangible assets are purchased research and development  technology  trademarks and trade names  and the assembled work force 
the purchased research and development of million was charged to expense in technology  also referred to as core or base technology and which represents that portion of the existing technology that provides a basis for future generation products as well as existing products  was recorded at million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the remaining identifiable intangible assets of million are being amortized on a straight line basis over to years weighted average life of years 
goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  was million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill directly associated with the nellcor acquisition was million for since the results of nellcor have only been included in the company s consolidated results since september  the amortization for represents ten months of activity 
the company also recorded a deferred tax liability of million  representing the tax effect of timing differences recorded as part of the acquisition 
in connection with the company s filing of a shelf registration statement for debt securities  mallinckrodt is engaged in discussions with the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the purchase price allocation related to its acquisition of nellcor 
the company and its auditors  ernst young llp  believe that the allocation and related amortization charges are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ernst young llp has expressed their opinion that the company s consolidated financial statements are fairly presented  in all material respects  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
nevertheless  if there are any significant changes as a result of these discussions with the sec to the amounts allocated to purchased research and development or other intangible assets or changes in the lives over which such amounts are amortized  these changes could have a material impact on the related noncash charges reflected in the results of operations and could materially affect future results of operations as a result of increased amortization expense 
the company s most significant divestitures were the animal health business and flavors joint venture in and the sale of the catalysts and chemical additives and aero systems divisions in and early in the company now operates predominantly in the healthcare industry and is comprised of three business groups respiratory  imaging and pharmaceuticals 
the company incurred a loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  for due to nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges related to the acquisition of nellcor which totaled million  million net of taxes or per share 
the nonrecurring noncash acquisition charges are purchased research and development and inventory stepped up to fair value 
purchased research and development  which was charged to results of operations during the first quarter of  was valued at million 
of this amount  million related to the respiratory group and million related to the aero systems division  which was sold and reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of the purchased research and development represents the value of numerous new medical devices and other products technologies in all major product lines eg  sensors  monitors and ventilators that were in various stages of development and had significant technological hurdles remaining as of the transaction date 
medical devices are subjected to significant clinical analysis and screening to validate their safety and efficacy as well as determine their commercial viability 
accordingly  medical devices are considered technologically feasible upon united states food and drug administration and or international regulatory body fda market approval 
the steps required to introduce these products include both research and development and clinical and regulatory costs and efforts to be expended over the next one to four years 
clinical and regulatory costs and efforts relate primarily to the costs and efforts associated with receiving fda approval  specifically costs and efforts incurred for clinical trials and preparation of fda submission and interaction with the fda 
none of these medical devices or products had received fda market approval as of the acquisition date  and therefore all were identified as in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility 
no alternative future uses were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility because of the uniqueness of the projects 
additionally  no identifiable alternate markets were established for projects that were in such early stages of development 
the methodology income approach used to evaluate purchased research and development was used to evaluate the other nellcor identifiable intangible assets acquired  with the exception of assembled work force  which was valued under the cost approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the assets over their useful lives 
the steps followed in applying this approach involve estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products  incorporating the cost to complete development of the technology  if applicable  and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows are then discounted to their present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such products were based upon management s estimate of revenue growth and expected profitability related to the overall product portfolio 
the discounting process uses a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money and investment risk factors to appropriately reflect the risks of realization of the cash flows 
the assumptions underlying the valuation of these assets were based upon management s assessment of the facts as known at the date of acquisition  however  no assurances can be given that actual results will not materially deviate from these assumptions 
revenue assumptions were based upon the growth rates for markets served and the estimated life of each product s technology 
significant aggregate revenue growth as projected by the company s strategic marketing units for the developed and in process products assumed increasing demand for medical devices  and the company s ability to maintain a significant share of the market 
the revenue generated by in process technology products increases to million in and then declines over subsequent years  while revenue assumptions for the developed products remain relatively flat in as compared with and then begin to decline gradually in subsequent periods 
cost of goods sold assumptions  expressed as a percentage of revenue  were expected to decrease from the current projection of percent to percent in gross margins  as they relate inversely to costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenue  were assumed to increase  in the aggregate  over time due mainly to improving efficiency in the manufacturing processes and more profitable products having a greater impact on total sales 
selling  administrative and general expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  expressed as a percentage of revenues were estimated at percent for all periods 
research and development expenses for the cost to complete the in process technologies were million to be expended in ten strategic marketing units during the periods through maintenance research and development expense  which includes routine changes  additions and modifications undertaken after a product is introduced to the market  were established at percent of revenue for both developed and in process technologies for all periods 
an after tax cash flow was then calculated by deducting income tax expense and contributory asset charges from operating income 
the cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate percent for developed technology and percent for in process technology 
results to date have been consistent with the underlying projections and assumptions of revenues to be generated  estimated costs to complete and completion dates for the in process projects and acquired technologies 
material negative variations from the projected results would impact the company s expected return on its investment in nellcor  its future results of operations and financial position 
in  the company received market approval and launched the model and model ventilators 
these products  although delayed approximately three months from expected launch date  have been well accepted in the market place 
the sale of nellcor inventories  which as part of the purchase price allocation were stepped up to fair value  decreased earnings by million  million net of taxes 
the pretax charges to the respiratory group and aero systems division  which was sold and reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter  were million and million  respectively 
with the acquisition complete  the company began integrating the operations of nellcor with those of mallinckrodt s other businesses 
management finalized and approved a nellcor integration plan during the year 
accordingly  the company recorded additional purchase liabilities of million  million net of related tax benefit  which were included in the acquisition cost allocation and related goodwill 
in addition  the company recorded pretax charges to operations during of million  million net of taxes  associated with exiting certain activities related to the operation of mallinckrodt prior to the acquisition of nellcor and other integration costs of the combined company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
excluding the nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges in  the company had earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share 
included in these results are after tax charges of million  or cents per share  primarily to increase reserves for nellcor trade receivables and inventory 
earnings from continuing operations for were million  or per share 
the year to year decline in earnings from continuing operations  after excluding nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges  is primarily attributable to the dilutive effect of the nellcor acquisition related intangible and goodwill amortization expense and interest expense  and selling price reductions 
the aggregate purchase price of nellcor of approximately billion was paid through use of available cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowings 
the resulting higher interest expense exceeded the operating earnings of the nellcor operations during the competitive demand for selling price reductions from healthcare customer buying groups continued throughout this trend  which is expected to continue  had its most significant impact on the company s imaging business where the potential for generic competitive products and available manufacturing capacity continue to lower prices 
the company recorded a net loss for of million  or per share as compared to net earnings of million  or per share during the prior year 
during  the company sold  or committed to sell  its catalysts and chemical additives and aero systems divisions 
the completed actions resulted in an after tax gain of million 
the sale of the remainder of the catalysts and chemical additives division on july  will result in a gain to be included in the results of discontinued operations 
the gains on the completed sales and the results of operations for these divisions have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter and  accordingly  prior year results have also been reclassified 
earnings  net of taxes  of these discontinued operations were million and million for and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million related to settlement costs from the sale of the animal health business in the prior year 
the net loss for also included an after tax noncash charge of million  or cents per share  for the early adoption of a new standard of accounting related to previously capitalized start up costs 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was recorded in the fourth quarter  but was effective as of july  operating earnings would have been reduced by million after taxes or cents per share had the company not adopted the accounting change 
net earnings for included a million after tax gain from discontinued operations resulting from the march  disposition of fries fries  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary which owned the company s percent interest in tastemaker  the flavors joint venture  and a million after tax loss from discontinued operations resulting from the sale of the animal health segment on june  net sales for the year increased percent to billion compared with billion in sales to customers outside the us were million or percent of total sales 
excluding sales of nellcor  which was acquired at the end of august  sales were billion which is equal to the prior year 
excluding the acquisition and integration charges discussed above  operating earnings were million  a decrease of million or percent from the prior year 
excluding the results of nellcor and the acquisition and integration charges discussed above  operating earnings were million or percent below the results of million 
the decline in operating earnings is driven by competitive price pressure in the imaging and critical care businesses 
vs 
the company s earnings from continuing operations for were million  or per share 
this represented a percent increase in per share earnings from continuing operations compared with million  or per share during the same period in the strong performance improvement was attributable to growth in operating earnings  higher interest income  global tax strategies and common stock share repurchase activities 
net earnings for were million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in in the fourth quarter of  the company reclassified the catalysts and chemical additives division to discontinued operations 
the after tax operating results from this division  which were million and million for and  respectively  were also reclassified 
on march   the company disposed of fries fries  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary which owned a percent interest in tastemaker  the flavors joint venture 
this action resulted in an after tax gain of million 
on june   the company disposed of the animal health segment  which resulted in an after tax loss of million 
the results of these transactions and the results of operations from these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations and  accordingly  prior years results were also reclassified 
net earnings for and included after tax earnings of million and million  respectively  from the divested fries fries  inc  animal health segment and  for  feed ingredients business 
net earnings for included a million after tax gain in discontinued operations due to the disposition of the feed ingredients business in the second quarter  partially offset by million after tax adjustment of provisions for environmental and litigation costs related to discontinued operations 
net sales for were up percent to billion  compared to billion in operating earnings were million  an increase of percent compared to million in the markets in which the company conducts business are highly competitive  and in many instances regulated 
global efforts toward healthcare cost containment exerted pressure on product pricing and the resultant demand for price discounts from customer buying groups adversely affected earnings growth 
operating results in millions net sales respiratory imaging pharmaceuticals operating earnings respiratory imaging pharmaceuticals corporate expense acquisition and integration expense vs 
healthcare is comprised of three business groups respiratory  imaging and pharmaceuticals 
operating earnings excluding charges related to acquisition and integration activities and corporate expenses were million  which represents a percent decline when compared to the prior year 
excluding the results of nellcor  acquired in august  the acquisition and integration charges  and corporate expenses  operating earnings would have been million or percent below this earnings decline is attributable to lower selling prices which were only partially offset by higher volume 
the competitive pressures and the demand for price discounts from customer buying groups adversely affected earnings  and this trend is expected to continue 
in response to this market trend  the company entered into a multi year agreement in with premier  inc premier  the largest healthcare purchasing group in the united states 
effective july   premier named mallinckrodt a corporate partner and  accordingly  premier s  member hospitals are provided incentives to use mallinckrodt products 
the respiratory group  which includes nellcor and critical care  reported operating earnings of million  an increase of percent over the results for excluding nellcor  operating earnings were million  a percent decrease from prior year 
the year to year earnings decline was attributable to sales decline of million resulting from the negative impact of exchange rate movements caused by the strengthening of the us dollar versus major european currencies and the japanese yen  million due to price declines and another million attributable to the divestiture of a product line in september these sales shortfalls were only partially offset by volume increases of million and million in disposable respiratory and anesthesiology product lines  respectively 
the imaging group had operating earnings of million  which was a decline of million or percent from the prior year 
the decline in profitability was directly attributable to a sales decline of million from million in to million in all product lines had volume increases which represented an increase of million over the prior year 
in spite of these increases  erosion of selling price accounted for a million sales decline 
the remainder of the shortfall in when compared to was attributable to the impact of exchange rate movements caused by the strengthening of the us dollar versus major european currencies and the japanese yen 
iodinated contrast media  the group s most significant product line  had sales volume increases of million  but price erosion reduced sales by million 
the pricing pressures were most significant in the us where the company and its contrast media competitors utilize price concessions to maintain or grow their shares in a market dominated by large customer buying groups 
the agreement with premier aligns the company with the largest healthcare purchasing group in the us  representing percent of all contrast media purchased 
the premier agreement is believed to be the largest contract ever written for these products 
in spite of cost reductions in contrast media manufacturing and lower operating expenses  the price erosion reduced profitability  and is expected to reduce profitability in future periods but at a lower rate of decline than was experienced in and the pharmaceuticals group  which now includes bulk and dosage pharmaceuticals  peptides  and process  laboratory and microelectronic chemicals  had operating earnings of million  which was million or percent above results for the prior year 
in spite of higher sales  product mix  lower than expected sales of high margin dosage and other specialty products  and the related impact on plant efficiencies negatively impacted operating earnings 
sales were million  which represented an increase of million or percent above results 
the sales increase was partially generated by a million increase in dosage analgesic volume  of which approximately million was attributable to the full year impact from an acquisition in november the remainder of the sales increase was attributable to volume growth in all other product lines 
the impact of buying groups is less evident in the pharmaceuticals group businesses 
overall  this group was able to maintain pricing at prior year levels 
vs 
operating earnings  excluding corporate expense  for were million  as compared with million in the flat operating earnings in when compared to the prior year was attributable to continued reduction of selling prices in several product lines offset by increased sales volumes  and a million or percent increase in research and development expenses 
net sales increased percent to billion in as compared to billion during the prior year 
the critical care business  now a component of the respiratory group  had operating earnings of million  which was million or percent greater than in the improved profitability was the result of product mix 
the operation had sales of million  which is million or percent below prior year 
the critical care business experienced increased demand for respiratory therapy products and hemocue blood hemoglobin and glucose analysis systems 
these sales gains were more than offset by lower prices of existing products and lost revenue associated with the blood gas and electrolyte business which was sold on september  the imaging group s operating earnings were million  which was million or percent below the prior year 
the decline in profitability was the result of selling price erosion  which was only partially offset by volume increases  and higher research and development expenditures 
the imaging group was affected significantly by the demand for price discounts 
the business had sales of million  which was an increase of million or percent over the prior year level of million 
the sales increase was driven primarily by increased market share in iodinated contrast media million and the acquisition of liebel flarsheim during million 
the growth of iodinated contrast media sales was most significant in the us market where sales volume increased percent  but prices declined percent when compared to the prior year 
contrast media competitor strategies with regard to pricing were driven by customer consolidation and patent expiration of a competitor s second generation x ray contrast product resulting in the potential for competitive generic products 
in response to these market changes  the company entered into a supply agreement with premier  inc  the largest hospital healthcare alliance in the us the agreement is believed to be the largest contract ever written for contrast media products 
the pharmaceuticals group  which includes bulk and dosage pharmaceuticals  peptides  and process  laboratory and microelectronic chemicals  had operating earnings of million  which is million or percent greater than in the improvement in earnings was directly attributable to a sales increase of million  or percent  to million as compared to the prior year 
the sales increase was generated by a million growth in bulk and dosage analgesic sales  partially the result of the acquisition of dm graham laboratories  inc in november the business also benefited from net price increases of approximately million  which were generated by bulk sales of acetaminophen and narcotics in spite of somewhat lower prices of dosage products 
dm graham laboratories  inc is a contract manufacturer of dosage pharmaceuticals and is also licensed to produce a variety of medicinal narcotics 
this acquisition was another key step in the continuing growth of the pharmaceuticals business 
in december  the company acquired expanded sales and marketing rights for molecular biosystems  inc s ultrasound imaging agents 
as a result of this and earlier agreements  mallinckrodt now has marketing rights for albunex and optison throughout the world except japan  south korea and taiwan 
in january  the company acquired liebel flarsheim company  a leading manufacturer of contrast media power injector systems for diagnostic imaging procedures and equipment for urology procedures 
the acquisition enhanced sales performance but modestly impaired operating earnings 
corporate matters corporate expenses in  excluding nonrecurring acquisition and integration charges  were million as compared to million in the prior year 
corporate expenses in were percent below the level because the prior year included consulting and employee related actions of a nonrecurring nature 
excluding the one time noncash write off of purchased research and development which had no tax benefit  the company s effective tax rate was percent  compared to last year s percent and the rate of percent 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
net interest and nonoperating income expense increased million in as compared with the prior year because of lower interest income and higher borrowing costs to acquire nellcor in august net interest and nonoperating income expense decreased million in from because cash proceeds from divestitures were used to repay debt and were invested in interest bearing securities 
financial condition the company s financial resources are expected to continue to be adequate to support existing businesses 
since june   cash and cash equivalents decreased million  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the outstanding common shares of nellcor in august operations provided million of cash  while acquisition and capital spending totaled billion 
the company received million in proceeds from asset disposals 
the catalyst business and aero systems division were sold in the fourth quarter for cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
debt as a percentage of invested capital was percent at june  the current ratio had declined to at the end of the second quarter as a result of short term borrowings during the first quarter of fiscal to acquire the outstanding shares of nellcor common stock 
during the third quarter  the company issued million in long term debt  with the proceeds used to reduce short term borrowing 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the current ratio improved to at june  on august   the company acquired nellcor through an agreement to purchase for cash all the outstanding shares of common stock of nellcor for per share 
the aggregate purchase price of the nellcor acquisition was approximately billion 
the company completed the acquisition using cash and cash equivalents and borrowed approximately billion under a billion credit facility established in july  and amended and restated in september the credit facility consisted of a million term loan  which was repaid in march  and a billion five year revolving credit facility 
under this facility  interest rates on borrowings are based upon the london interbank offered rate  plus a margin dependent on the company s senior debt rating 
there was no borrowing outstanding under the revolving credit facility at june  in december  the company filed a million shelf debt registration statement which has not  as yet  been declared effective 
the unused portions of shelf registrations filed in and have been canceled 
at june   the company had a billion private placement commercial paper program 
the program is backed by the billion five year us revolving credit facility available until september at june   there were million commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
non us lines of credit totaling million were also available and borrowings under these lines amounted to million at june  the non us lines are cancelable at any time 
the company s board of directors previously authorized repurchase of million shares of common stock and additional repurchases not to exceed cash outlays of million 
share repurchases under these authorizations have totaled million shares  including thousand shares during the current year prior to the acquisition of nellcor 
estimated capital spending for the year ending june  is approximately million 
impact of year the year issue is the result of date sensitive devices  systems and computer programs that were deployed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any such technologies may recognize a year containing as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed its assessment of its information systems which support business applications and is in the process of modifying or replacing those portions of the software that are required 
the assessment of products sold to customers has also been completed and the necessary remediation plans are being developed 
the assessment of research and development  manufacturing processes and facility management systems is underway and is expected to be substantially complete by january the company is also assessing the readiness of its key suppliers and business partners to be year compliant 
information requests have been distributed and replies are being evaluated 
if the risk is deemed material  the company is prepared to perform on site visits to those businesses to verify the adequacy of the information received 
all of these efforts should be substantially complete during the first quarter of calendar  which is prior to any anticipated significant impact on mallinckrodt s operations 
based upon the accomplishments to date  no contingency plans are expected to be needed and therefore none have been developed 
however  because of substantial progress to date and plans that contemplate being substantially complete in the early part of calendar  we believe adequate time will be available to insure alternatives can be developed  assessed and implemented prior to a year issue having a material negative impact on the operations of the company 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
both internal and external resources are being used to reprogram or replace non compliant technologies  and to appropriately test year modifications 
such modifications are being funded through operating cash flows 
the project to address year has been underway since february the pretax costs incurred to date for this effort were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the company anticipates expenses of approximately million will be incurred in to substantially complete the effort 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company believes it will substantially complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
such estimates were derived using software surveys and programs to evaluate calendar date exposures and numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
because none of these estimates can be guaranteed  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
european monetary union emu the euro is scheduled to be introduced on january   at which time the eleven participating emu member countries will establish fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies will continue to be used as legal tender through january   thereafter  the legacy currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
the company s european sales offices and various manufacturing and distribution facilities affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the systems issues raised by the euro currency conversion and are cognizant of the potential business implications of converting to a common currency 
the company is unable to determine the ultimate financial impact of the conversion on its operations  if any  given that the impact will be dependent upon the competitive situations which exist in the various regional markets in which the company participates and the potential actions which may or may not be taken by the company s competitors and suppliers 
environmental matters the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
in addition  the company is in varying stages of active investigation or remediation of alleged or acknowledged contamination at currently or previously owned or operated sites and at off site locations where its waste was taken for treatment or disposal 
once the company becomes aware of its potential environmental liability at a particular site  the measurement of the related environmental liabilities to be recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts such as the extent and types of hazardous substances at a site  the range of technologies that can be used for remediation  evolving standards of what constitutes acceptable remediation  presently enacted laws and regulations  engineers and environmental specialists estimates of the range of expected clean up costs that may be incurred  prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  and the progress to date on remediation in process 
while the current law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  the company s contribution to clean up these sites is expected to be limited  given the number of other companies which have also been named as potentially responsible parties and the volumes of waste involved 
a reasonable basis for apportionment of costs among responsible parties is determined and the likelihood of contribution by other parties is established 
if it is considered probable that the company will only have to pay its expected share of the total clean up  the recorded liability reflects the company s expected share 
in determining the probability of contribution  the company considers the solvency of the parties  whether responsibility is disputed  existence of an allocation agreement  status of current action  and experience to date regarding similar matters 
current information and developments are regularly assessed by the company  and accruals are adjusted on a quarterly basis  as required  to provide for the expected impact of these environmental matters 
most of the company s environmental related capital expenditures are in response to provisions of the federal clean air act  water pollution control act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  and land use  air and water protection regulations of the various localities and states  and their foreign counterparts 
capital expenditures worldwide relating to air emission control  wastewater purification  land reclamation and solid waste disposal totaled approximately million in and million in the company currently estimates that environmental capital expenditures during and will be million and million  respectively 
during  the company assumed certain liabilities to remediate various sites in the future and was compensated by the previous owner of the applicable properties for certain remediation costs to be incurred 
the company established additional environmental reserves for discontinued operations 
the company had accruals  included in current accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits  of million at june  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and for the company s current and former operating sites 
any claims for potential recovery from any sources have not been valued against the accrued environmental liabilities 
while ongoing litigation may eventually result in recovery of costs expended at certain of the environmental sites  any gain is contingent upon a successful outcome and has not been accrued 
the company has established accruals only for those matters that are in its view probable and estimable 
based upon information currently available  management believes that existing accruals are sufficient and that it is not reasonably possible at this time that any additional liabilities will result from the resolution of these matters that would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk management strategies the company operates globally  with manufacturing and distribution facilities in various countries throughout the world  and is subject to certain opportunities and risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and government actions 
various operational initiatives are employed to help manage business risks 
in the ordinary course of business  mallinckrodt purchases materials and sells finished products denominated in approximately different currencies 
the company is primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates of the german deutsche mark and other european currencies highly correlated with the german deutsche mark and the japanese yen 
overall  the company is a net beneficiary when the us dollar weakens and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the major currencies identified 
operations in each country are monitored so that the company can quickly respond to changing economic and political environments as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to minimize the exposure on intercompany loans 
to minimize the impact of anticipated foreign currency exposures which arise from probable purchases of raw materials or other inventory  collection of accounts receivable  settlement of accounts payable  and periodic debt service by international subsidiaries which occur in the ordinary course of business  the company hedges a portion of its non us dollar denominated exposures by purchasing currency options which generally have terms of two years or less  and which have little or no intrinsic value at time of purchase 
the company uses the options with an objective of limiting negative foreign exchange rate effects on overall performance for both budget and prior year comparisons over a rolling to month horizon 
the company seeks to have effective coverage levels over such to month horizon of to percent of currency exposures that subject the company to risk 
the hedges are designed to satisfy the requirements for deferral accounting treatment at inception 
gains and losses in the hedges are expected to be systematically monetized with concurrent reinvestment to replace monetized hedges and maintain overall hedging coverage targets 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for  and  including conversion of certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain transactions and balance sheet exposures 
the foreign currency translation loss included in shareholders equity  and resulting from the translation of the financial statements of most of the company s international affiliates into us dollars  increased by million in due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the functional currency of many of the company s international affiliates 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments as well as interest paid on its short term debt 
to manage the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding debt to a more desirable fixed or variable rate basis or to limit the company s exposure to rising interest rates  the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps and option contracts 
the company does not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on the businesses in which it operates 
while future economic events cannot be predicted  the company believes its current operations and future expansion plans will not result in a significantly different risk profile 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has determined that its market risk exposures  which arise primarily from exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates  are not material to its future earnings  fair value and cash flows
