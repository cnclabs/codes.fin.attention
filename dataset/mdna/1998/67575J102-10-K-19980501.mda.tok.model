the company takes advantage of closeout and other special situation purchasing opportunities which frequently result in large volume purchases  and as a consequence  its cash requirements are not constant or predictable during the year and can be affected by the timing and size of its purchases

the company currently anticipates opening new stores in each of the next few years 
in addition to new store openings  the company may increase the number of stores it operates through acquisitions 
management believes that from time to time  acquisition opportunities will arise 
possible acquisitions will vary in size and the company will consider larger acquisitions that could be material to the company 
in order to finance any such possible acquisitions  the company may use cash flow from operations  may borrow additional amounts under its revolving credit facility  may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing or may use its equity securities as consideration 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to the financial condition and performance of the company  and some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
seasonality the company  with the growth of the retail operations and the retail orientation of the vcm  ltd 
joint venture  has shifted its business mix more toward retail 
this shift will also effect the net sales and earnings pattern of the company  with a greater weighting toward the second half of the fiscal year 
year disclosure the company has completed a review of its management information systems regarding year issues 
the company s planned systems initiatives will resolve the majority of the issues as current systems are converted to year compliant systems 
the company expects to bring all of its management information systems into year compliance by fiscal while it is likely that these efforts will be successful  if necessary modifications and conversions are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
costs associated with making management information systems year compliant are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
