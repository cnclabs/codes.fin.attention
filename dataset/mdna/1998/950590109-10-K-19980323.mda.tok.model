in  new hortons were opened  including in the united states 
the concept is extremely flexible and includes standard units with a bakery  both with and without drive through windows  double drive through buildings  and various other satellites  kiosks and carts 
in addition  combination units shared with wendy s are utilized 
future expansion in canada is anticipated to be primarily through franchising and the company plans to open about canadian hortons in hortons will also continue development in the united states  and plans to open stores in hortons is primarily a franchise operation in canada and financial success depends on developing new stores and increasing average unit sales 
this results in royalties  rental income and revenue from warehouse sales

at year end  there were international wendy s open outside canada  with restaurants opened in international growth outside canada continues to be primarily through franchising  but real estate joint ventures and company operated units are also planned 
the company plans on opening new wendy s in international markets outside north america in and intends to increase international development in future years 
inflation financial statements determined on a historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for the company 
inventories approximate current market prices  there is some ability to adjust prices  and liabilities are repaid with dollars of reduced purchasing power 
management s outlook management is committed to increasing shareholder value over time 
the initiatives implemented to dispose of underperforming restaurants  write down underperforming assets  establish appropriate reserve levels and  accelerate restaurant development  are all consistent with management s long term focus 
likewise  management believes the new enterprise wide information systems and a new store management system will position the company for future information technology challenges 
management believes the common share repurchase program is in the best interest of the company and shareholders 
the company intends to adhere to its long established strategies of exceeding customer expectations  fostering a performance driven culture  delivering a balanced message of brand equity plus value in advertising and creating a healthy restaurant system 
the company believes that its success depends on providing quality products and everyday value  not in discounting products 
menu variety is also an important part of customer satisfaction 
restaurants are remodeled on a recurring basis to maintain a fresh image and increase convenience for consumers 
when combined with effective marketing  the goal of these initiatives is to increase the number of transactions and average sales per restaurant 
new restaurant development continues to be very important 
both wendy s and hortons restaurant concepts are underpenetrated in domestic and international markets 
the company intends to grow aggressively  but responsibly  focusing on the markets with the best potential for sales and return on investment 
each new company owned unit must meet minimum operational and financial requirements before being approved for development 
a total of new restaurants were added in current plans call for approximately new units to open in of these  approximately are planned as wendy s restaurants and are planned to be hortons 
while the majority of units will continue to be traditional sites  special sites  such as shopping malls and universities  will contribute to this growth 
the company plans to accelerate the new unit development growth rate beginning in and expects to open about new units in during resources will be allocated to manage the increased development 
the company will continue its strategy to enhance the overall health of the wendy s system by acquiring restaurants from  and selling restaurants to  franchisees where prudent 
the company does not expect the gains generated from selling company restaurants to be as significant to overall earnings as in recent years 
gains in the past three years were million in  million in and million in in  these gains are expected to be in the million to million range 
the strength and vitality of the franchise community is an essential part of the continued success of the company 
various strategies have been developed to assist individual franchisees and the overall franchise system 
the goal of these strategies is to encourage responsible new restaurant development  add new franchisees  enhance minority representation  increase royalty income  and maintain a high royalty receivable collection rate 
the company will continue to maintain appropriate reserves against franchise receivables 
the company is optimistic about development of hortons in the united states  but the concept does not yet enjoy the superior brand recognition it has in canada 
the entire domestic quick service industry is competitive and there are many established baked goods outlets 
the company plans to build consumer awareness and traffic for hortons 
the company remains optimistic about long term opportunities for international operations 
most of wendy s development outside north america is with franchisees who are affected by economic conditions  such as those recently experienced in southeast asia 
europe and the middle east also remain very challenging 
likewise  although the canadian economy remains strong  the canadian dollar has weakened in recent months and wendy s company operations and hortons franchise operations were impacted 
the company does not believe these conditions change the long term potential of the international business  but they could influence short term results 
year the company has completed an assessment of year compliance 
the year issue concerns the ability of date sensitive software to properly recognize the year in calculating and processing computer system information 
the company has initiated a plan to install a new enterprise wide information system and a new store management system  which will include new software that is year compliant 
the company has made an assessment that some existing software will need to be modified since it will not be replaced by the new information systems 
the modification is expected to cost million to million  of which million has been expensed in  and the remainder will be expensed over the next two years 
the new information systems are estimated to cost approximately million to million  a substantial portion of which will be capitalized 
the company anticipates timely completion of these projects which should mitigate the year issue 
however  if the new information systems are not implemented on a timely basis and if modifications to existing systems can not be accomplished on a timely basis  there would be adverse financial and operational effects on the company 
the amount of these effects can not be ascertained at this time
