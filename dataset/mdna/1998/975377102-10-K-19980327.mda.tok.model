this stock purchase resulted in a net debt reduction in of million 
these reductions in debt levels and the company s increased profitability have led to improved financial ratios and  in turn  allowed the company to pay lower spreads between the base rate and libor and the rates which the company is obligated to pay its lenders 
these lower spreads decreased the company s effective interest rate below those incurred in income tax expense winsloew s effective tax rate from continuing operations of and in is greater than the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization

sales of casual products are typically higher in the second quarter and fourth quarters of each year  primarily as a result of the following i high retail demand for casual furniture in the second quarter  preceding the summer months and ii the impact of special sales programs on fourth quarter sales 
the company s casual product sales can also be affected by weather conditions during the peak retail selling season and the resulting impact on consumer purchases of outdoor furniture products

liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support its debt service  accounts receivable and inventory requirements 
the company has historically financed its short term liquidity needs with internally generated funds and revolving line of credit borrowings 
at december  the company had million of working capital and million of unused and available funds under its credit facilities 
the company has a senior credit facility with a consortium of banks and other institutional lenders 
the facility  which matures in february and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company  consists of a revolving line of credit  term loan and an acquisition line of credit 
the working capital revolving line of credit allows the company to borrow funds up to a certain percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the million acquisition line of credit can be used for capital expenditures and purchases of the company s common stock 
in june  winsloew amended its senior credit facility to provide the company with a variable amount available under the revolving line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the seasonal nature of the casual furniture product line  winsloew s cash requirements are usually greater in the first quarter of each year 
the june amendment allows the amount available to fluctuate with the seasonal nature of the company s business 
after the first quarter of each year  the company s cash requirements from its credit line decline 
by use of a variable amount of credit availability  the company can avoid the cost of an available but unused line of credit 
at december   from an available maximum line of credit of million  winsloew has elected to set the amount available at million 
in july  winsloew amended its senior credit facility to allow the company to borrow under its line of credit to purchase shares of the company s common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   there was million available for such repurchases 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations increased to million in primarily due to improved profitability from continuing operations 
cash flows from investing activities during  the company spent million on capital expenditures and received million in proceeds related to the disposition of certain assets of its wrought iron business 
at december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities the company used the cash generated by operations and from investing activities to repay million of debt during foreign exchange fluctuations and effects of inflation winsloew purchases some raw materials from several italian suppliers 
these purchases expose the company to the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus the italian lira 
if the us dollar declines in value versus the italian lira  the company will pay more in us dollars for these purchases 
to reduce its exposure to loss from such potential foreign exchange fluctuations  the company will occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
these contracts allow the company to buy italian lira at a predetermined exchange rate  thereby transferring the risk of subsequent exchange rate fluctuations to a third party 
however  if the company is unable to continue such forward contract activities  and the company s inventories increase in connection with expanding sales activities  a weakening of the us dollar against the italian lira could result in reduced gross margins 
the company elected to hedge a portion of its exposure to purchases made in by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with a value of million at december  the company did not incur significant gains or losses from these foreign currency transactions 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company in the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
year the company began an assessment of year issues on its computer system in mid and began the process of updating hardware and software at each of its facilities 
the company is completing the software and hardware installation at the last facility which is expected to be completed during the first half of the company has no plans to address these issues with its discontinued operations as the expected date of disposition is mid the company estimates the cost to complete the project for the to period at approximately  of which approximately  was capitalized and approximately  was expensed through december from an ongoing cost standpoint  the year issues are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity
