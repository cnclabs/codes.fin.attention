item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview was a year in which operations improved relative to and a number of transactions were accomplished which the company believes will enhance its future growth prospects 
such transactions included the company raised million by issuing class b stock through a stock subscription million and class a stock through a rights offering million 
the animal health division ahd acquired the worldwide decoquinate deccoxr product and business from a major pharmaceutical company 
the product is an anticocidial feed additive which provides ahd with its first major product in the cattle industry 
the fine chemicals division fcd purchased a worldwide polymyxin business which complements its existing polymyxin business 
both the us pharmaceuticals division uspd and the international pharmaceuticals division ipd completed partnership alliances and marketing agreements to broaden their product lines 
results in included charges for management actions 
in addition  operations were negatively affected by external market conditions in both industry segments 
the factors which combined to produce a loss in and the status of these factors in are as follows charges for management actions approximately million after tax 
rationalization of the ipd s selling and marketing organization in scandinavia resulting in charges for severance 
status completed 
commencement of an ipd plan to transfer all tablet  ointment and liquid production from copenhagen  denmark to lier  norway resulting in charges for severance  asset write offs and other exit costs 
status in process  completion expected in late commencement of a uspd plan to accelerate the move of production from locations in new jersey and new york to an existing plant in lincolnton  north carolina resulting in charges for severance  asset write offs and other exit costs 
status completed  benefits realized due to more efficient production in the uspd 
rationalization of the ahd and uspd organizations to address current competitive conditions in their respective industries resulting in charges for severance and other termination benefits 
status completed 
external factors 
fundamental shift in generic pharmaceutical industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns resulting in significantly lower sales and prices in the uspd 
status uspd sales increased marginally in a more orderly market  however there was continuing but significantly lessened pressure on pricing relative to significant bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of a major wholesaler to the uspd and collection difficulties in certain international markets 
status no major bankruptcies  but collection of certain accounts remains slow in certain international markets 
high feed grain prices in the animal health industry which resulted in lower industry usage of feed additive products supplied by ahd and increased competition among feed additive suppliers 
status grain prices at more normal levels 
competitive conditions continue 
generally increased competition in all industries and markets served by the company s operating divisions 
status all markets remain competitive 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  for the year ended december  revenue was million  an increase of million compared to operating income was million  an increase of million  compared to net income was million

see section management actions 
revenues on an overall basis revenues increased in the animal health segment ahs and decreased in the human pharmaceuticals segment hps 
revenues compared to were reduced by over million primarily in the hps due to translation of sales in foreign currency into the us dollar 
revenues in the hps were marginally lower 
than revenues increased in the uspd due primarily to increased volume in a number of rx and otc products including products introduced in the past three years 
the increased volume was partially offset by lower net selling prices resulting from the continuation of programs initiated by major wholesalers in the second half of which fundamentally shifted generic pharmaceutical industry distribution purchasing and stocking patterns 
in ipd overall volume and pricing were up on a local currency basis 
however  ipd revenues were lower primarily as a result of the effect of translation of sales in scandinavian currencies into the us dollar 
a substantial majority of the translation effect was recognized in the ipd 
for the year average exchange rates for scandinavian currencies where ipd conducts a substantial portion of its business have declined by compared to sales in the fine chemicals division fcd principally increased due to higher volume 
within the ahs  ahd revenues increased primarily due to increased volume of most major products  as well as the acquisition of the deccox business in september aquatic animal health division aahd revenues increased compared to due primarily to increased sales in the norwegian fish vaccine market resulting from both new product volume and increased market share of existing products 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit increased million and the gross margin percent increased to in compared to in both segments increased their margin percentages and amounts relative to the increase in dollars and percent was the result of a number of factors 
hps gross profits accounted for approximately half of the increase in dollars and uspd accounted for the majority of hps increase 
uspd gross profits improved as a result of lower manufacturing costs in the aggregate due to the transfer of production and closing of two marginal facilities as part of management actions in and increased production efficiencies in the two remaining core facilities 
offsetting savings in production costs were lower net selling prices in the upsd 
ipd had increased gross profits in local currencies but decreased in the aggregate when translated into us dollars 
fcd gross profits increased marginally compared to ahd gross profits increased due to increased volume both existing products and deccox offset partially by somewhat lower pricing 
aahd gross profits increased due to higher margin products introduced in operating expenses operating expenses on a consolidated basis decreased million or 
included in operating expenses in were charges incurred for management actions totaling million

the following table compares operating expenses for the year with and without management actions operating expenses as reported management actions as a of revenues the net reduction in operating expenses  after excluding management actions reflects a continued emphasis on cost control  the effect of currency translation on expenses incurred in foreign currencies  and a reduction of expenses resulting from prior year management actions which reduced payroll  offset by planned increases in certain expenses and increases in administrative expenses resulting from personnel changes  employee incentive programs  and litigation expenses 
operating income operating income as reported in increased million 
the increase in gross profit due to increased sales and lower production costs  lower operating expenses  and the absence of charges for management actions all contributed to the increase

revenues revenues declined by million in the ahs 
the ahd revenues declined due to lower sales volume of bmdr and other feed additives primarily to the poultry market and price erosion due to competition 
the decline in the sale of other feed additives to the poultry market is attributable mainly to the mutual termination of a distribution agreement with merck agvet 
aahd revenues were lower due to the introduction of competitive products in the norwegian fish vaccine market and an overall reduction in norwegian salmon production 
revenues in the hps were million lower primarily due to uspd revenues which declined approximately  as a result of price and volume reductions in the base product line principally cough and cold products due to a fundamental shift in industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns including a substantial drop in sales to generic drug distributors 
the declines were partially offset by increased sales of products introduced in and and sales of minoxidil introduced in the second quarter of revenues for ipd and fcd declined by and  respectively due to volume reductions and to a lesser extent currency translation offset partially by limited price increases 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit decreased million and the gross margin percent was in compared to in the gross profit for the ahs declined due to the lower volume sold of bmd and high margin fish vaccines and generally lower pricing due to competition 
the gross profit in the hps declined over million due principally to the uspd 
the uspd was affected by lower sales volume  and significantly lower pricing across the product line due to changes in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
lower sales volume also affected gross profit by causing reduced production volume which increases production costs per unit 
ipd and fcd also had lower gross margins due primarily to lower sales 
in addition  includes million primarily for accrued stay bonuses for production employees in facilities to be closed in both the uspd and ipd

management actions in december  after the acquisition of alpharma oslo from al industrier al  the company announced a number of management actions which included staff reductions and certain product line and facilities rationalizations as a first step toward realizing combination synergies and maximizing the overall position of the newly combined company 
in september  the company announced additional management actions which continued the process begun in december the actions included elimination of approximately positions company wide employees were severed in  further efforts toward consolidation of operations in uspd  the utilization of substantial consulting resources focused primarily on accelerating the realization of certain combination benefits in the ipd and the sale in september of its minority equity position and certain other rights in a research and development company which was identified for disposal in december in the first quarter of  the company continued the rationalization process and announced the reorganization of the ipd sales and marketing organization in scandinavia 
the reorganization resulted in severing personnel at a cost of million 
ipd estimates the annual expense reduction by from this action at over million 
in the second quarter of  the board of directors approved an ipd production rationalization plan which includes the transfer of all tablet  ointment and liquid production from copenhagen  denmark to lier  norway 
the full transfer will be completed in and will result in a net reduction of approximately employees 
the rationalization plan resulted in a charge in the second quarter for severance for copenhagen employees  an impairment write off for certain buildings and machinery and equipment and other exit costs 
in  the company announced a plan by uspd to move all suppositories and cream and ointment production from two locations to the lincolnton  north carolina location 
in the second quarter of  uspd prepared a plan to accelerate the previously approved plan for consolidation of the manufacturing operations within uspd 
the board of directors approved the acceleration in may the acceleration plan included the discontinuing of all activities in two uspd manufacturing facilities in new york and new jersey and the transfer of all pharmaceutical production from those sites to the facility in lincolnton  north carolina 
the plan provided for complete exit by early and resulted in a net reduction of over employees 
the acceleration plan resulted in a second quarter charge in for severance of employees  a write off for leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment and significant exit costs including estimated remaining lease costs and facility refurbishment costs 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its tablet business which was located in new jersey and sub leased the new jersey location 
the sale netted proceeds of approximately million and resulted in the adjustment of certain accruals for exit costs made in the second quarter which contemplated the shut down of the facility 
because of the time necessary to complete the transfers  the production rationalization plans include stay bonus plans to keep the production work force intact until the transfer is complete 
the stay bonus plans generally require the employee remain until their position is eliminated to earn a payment 
the overall cost of these plans is estimated at million and is being accrued over the periods necessary to achieve the shut downs 
in the first quarter of  the uspd stay bonus was paid upon completion of the transfer 
in the second half of  additional management actions included a reorganization at uspd which resulted in severing employees and a reorganization of the ahd business practices and staffing levels which resulted in severing and or early retirement of employees and other exit costs 
as a result of the reorganizations in uspd and ahd the company believes annual payroll and payroll related costs of million have been eliminated 
the production rationalization plans have begun to benefit operations in for uspd and are expected to benefit operations in ipd in late inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in stockholders equity in primarily reflects net income in less dividends  the sale of million in common stock in offset partially by a decrease in the translation adjustment million due to the weakening of the danish krone  norwegian krone and the indonesian rupiah in working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
significant fluctuations included accounts receivable being higher in by million resulting from substantially higher fourth quarter sales in the uspd and the european subsidiaries 
prior year accounts receivable included a tax refund receivable of million recorded in due to the domestic tax loss incurred by the company 
the tax receivable was collected in accrued expenses decreased due primarily to payments in of accruals for severance related to management actions set up in all working capital elements also decreased in in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the danish krone and norwegian krone  weakened versus the us dollar as compared to by approximately and  respectively 
in addition  the danish subsidiary has a subsidiary in indonesia whose assets  liabilities and equity translated into substantially less danish krone and ultimately us dollars due to the devaluation in of the indonesian rupiah 
the approximate decrease due to currency translation was accounts receivable million  inventory million and accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
the company presently has various capital expenditure programs under way and planned including the expansion of the lier  norway facility 
in  the company s capital expenditures were million  and in the company plans to spend a greater amount than in at december   the company had million available under existing short term unused lines of credit and million in cash 
in addition  the company has million available in europe under long term lines of credit and million available under an amended revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the combination of cash from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs 
a substantial portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
at december   the company has entered into interest rate agreements to fix the interest rates for million of the variable debt at plus the required margin through october the company is considering similar transactions to fix additional variable rate debt for specified periods to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
in addition to investments for internal growth  the company has intensified its pursuit of complementary acquisitions  particularly in human pharmaceuticals  that can provide new products and market opportunities as well as leverage existing assets 
in order to accomplish any significant acquisition  it is likely that the company will need to obtain additional financing in the form of equity related securities and or borrowings 
the company is currently seeking between million and million of financing through a private placement of convertible subordinated notes including a commitment of al industrier to purchase at least million of such convertible subordinated debt 
any new borrowings other than pursuant to existing lines of credit by the company will require consent of the bank lenders under the company s revolving credit facility who have approved the issuance of such convertible subordinated debt 
the company s outstanding warrants for the issuance of common stock expire on january   and the company cannot predict whether such warrants will be exercised 
if all such warrants were exercised the company would issue  shares of common stock and receive approximately million 
depending upon the timing and success of the company s potential acquisitions and other corporate developments  the company may seek additional debt or equity financing in the future and intends to seek refinancing of the indebtedness under its revolving credit agreement which matures in year the company has taken various actions to understand the nature and work required to make its systems year compliant 
the company continues to evaluate the estimated costs and has commenced portions of the work required to achieve compliance 
while compliance has and will involve additional costs the company believes  based on current information  it will achieve year compliance without a material adverse effect on its operations or financial position

 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits was issued 
this statement modifies financial statement disclosures related to pension and other postretirement plans  including standardization of disclosures for pension plans and other postretirement plans  permitting the aggregation of information regarding certain plans  additional disclosures related to the change in benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets  and elimination of certain other disclosures 
this statement addresses disclosure issues and therefore will not have an effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  and is effective for periods beginning after december  risk factors this report includes certain forward looking statements 
like any company subject to a competitive business environment  the company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the company s forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following competition all of the company s businesses operate in highly competitive markets and many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
as a result  the company may be at a disadvantage in its ability to develop new products to meet competitive demands 
in addition  once a product is approved  the company may not be able to market its product or establish a favorable market price as effectively as larger competitors 
the us generic pharmaceutical industry has historically been characterized by intense competition 
as patents for brand name products and other bases for market exclusivity expire  prices typically decline as generic competitors enter the marketplace 
normally  there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increase causing an intensifying of competitive pricing 
the timing of these price decreases as to any particular product is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed profitable generic product life cycle 
in addition brand name manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents through marketing and regulatory activities and litigation 
during  some branded pharmaceutical companies appeared to increase their efforts to utilize state and federal legislative and regulatory forums to delay generic competition and limit the branded product market erosion that occurs once patent protection is lost for a branded product 
generic pharmaceutical market conditions in the us were further exacerbated in the second half of by a fundamental shift in industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors 
the company believes that this trend continues to date 
programs initiated by major wholesalers have accelerated price declines and have had a negative effect on sales 
wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold  lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler s own marketing programs 
the company has been and will continue to be affected by the competitive and changing nature of this industry 
accordingly  because of competition  the significance of relatively few major customers eg large wholesalers and chain stores  a rapidly changing market and uncertainty of timing of new product approvals  the sales volume  prices and profits of the company s us pharmaceutical division and its generic competitors are subject to unforeseen fluctuation 
in addition  in europe the company is encountering price pressure from parallel imports ie  imports of identical products from lower priced markets under european union eu laws of free movement of goods and general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices 
parallel imports could lead to lower volume growth and both parallel imports and governmental cost containment could create downward pressure on prices in certain product and geographical market areas including the nordic countries where the company has significant sales 
government regulation the research  development  manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the usfda  or the us department of agriculture usda  as well as by the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission cpsc  and by comparable authorities in the eu  norway  indonesia and other countries 
although norway is not a member of the eu  it is a member of the european economic association and  as such  has accepted all eu regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals 
government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy labeling  storage  recordkeeping  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil or criminal fines  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  debarment of individuals or the company from obtaining new generic drug approvals  refusal of the government to approve new products and criminal prosecution 
such government regulation substantially increases the cost of producing human pharmaceutical and animal health products 
in the us  the usfda has imposed stringent regulatory requirements relating to the operation of manufacturing plants 
the company s us manufacturing facilities  as well as two of the company s european plants that manufacture products for export to the us and certain of its contract manufacturers  are affected in that they are required to comply with the us manufacturing regulations 
failure to demonstrate compliance during periodic inspections could lead to a cessation or curtailment of plant operations 
similar regulatory requirements exist in the foreign countries where the company or its contract manufacturers have facilities  and in certain countries where the company sells its products  and non compliance could lead to adverse events similar to those described above 
the company and its subsidiaries have filed applications to market pharmaceutical and animal health products with regulatory agencies both in the us and internationally 
the approval of these applications  and the timing of such approvals  can significantly affect future revenues and income 
this is particularly important with respect to human pharmaceuticals where it is the company s strategy to obtain regulatory approval to market a generic formulation as soon as third party s patent protection ends and prior to the price erosion normally caused by the entry of other generic competitors 
there can be no assurance that new product approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if ever 
failure to obtain such approvals  or to obtain such approvals when expected  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company s animal health products  such as feed additives  could be affected by legislation or regulatory rulings reportedly under consideration in one or more countries restricting the sale of products containing antibiotics 
based upon public reports  the company understands that the governments of certain european countries have banned the sale of certain of such products 
the company cannot predict whether such initiatives will ultimately affect its products 
any such restrictive legislation or regulation in norway or the us would have a significant effect on the company s business 
regulatory compliance impacts operating expenses directly by requiring the addition of personnel  programs and capital and indirectly by adding activities without directly increasing efficiency 
the costs both direct and indirect of regulatory compliance which have increased in recent years may continue to increase in the future 
for a more detailed description of governmental regulations see information applicable to all business segments regulation 
foreign operations  risk of currency fluctuation the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations  including  in certain countries  currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions  restrictions on imports  government price controls  restrictions on the level of remittance of dividends  interest  royalties and other payments  the need for government approval of new operations  the continuation of existing operations and other corporate actions  political instability  the possibility of expropriation and uncertainty as to the enforceability of commercial rights  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
the company s far east operations  particularly indonesia where the company has a manufacturing facility  are being affected by the wide currency fluctuations and decreased economic activity in many countries in such geographical areas 
while the company s present exposure to economic factors in the far east is not material  the region is a key area for the company s anticipated future growth 
while from time to time the company may engage in hedging activities  the company cannot predict future currency fluctuations or future governmental regulatory actions or their impact on the company 
dependence on single sources of raw material supply and contract manufacturers raw materials used in certain products are currently sourced from single qualified suppliers  both foreign and domestic  and certain products sold by the company are purchased from single contract manufacturers 
although the company has not experienced difficulty to date in acquiring active raw materials  other materials for production development  or products purchased from contract manufacturers  there can be no assurance that supply interruptions will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to obtain substitute materials or products  which would require additional product validations and regulatory submissions 
further  there can be no assurance that contract manufacturers that supply the company will continue to do so 
any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture products  to sell products manufactured under contract or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of such products 
third party reimbursement pricing pressures the company s commercial success in producing  marketing and selling generic products will depend  in part  on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party health care payers  such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available to enable the company to maintain its present product price levels 
in addition  the market for the company s products may be limited by actions of third party payers 
for example  many managed health care organizations are now controlling the pharmaceutical products for which reimbursement will be provided 
the resulting competition among pharmaceutical companies to place their products on these approved lists has created a trend of downward pricing pressure in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be included on the approved lists of managed care organizations or that downward pricing pressures in the industry generally will not negatively impact the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability for current products continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety  and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing and  in certain countries  give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the assertion of such a product liability claim 
risks associated with potential acquisitions the company has intensified its search for acquisitions which will provide new product and market opportunities  leverage existing assets and add critical mass 
the company s human pharmaceutical divisions currently are actively evaluating various acquisition possibilities  including joint ventures and licensing arrangements 
the company cannot predict whether any acquisition which meets its criteria will be available on terms acceptable to the company  that financing for any such acquisitions will be available on satisfactory terms  that the company will be able to accomplish its strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition or that any business or assets acquired by the company will be integrated successfully into the company s operations 
given other transactions in the pharmaceutical industry  and the values of potential acquisition targets  any such acquisitions could initially be dilutive to the company s earnings and may add significant intangible assets and related goodwill amortization charges 
depending upon the timing and success of the company s acquisition strategy and other corporate developments  the company may seek additional debt or equity financing  resulting in additional leverage and dilution of ownership  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s acquisition strategy  or any other component of its strategy  will be successful
