results of operations consolidated operating results from to were affected by the following significant developments 
restructuring  asset impairment and other charges 
in connection with the company s review of its accounts in accordance with its established accounting policies  as well as a change in the company s methodology for evaluating the recoverability of goodwill as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges were recorded during fourth quarter after consideration of related tax effects  these charges reduced consolidated earnings by million  or per share 
the charges include a million impairment of goodwill associated with kcsr s acquisition of midsouth corporation midsouth in in response to the changing competitive and business environment in the rail industry  the company revised its accounting methodology for evaluating the recoverability of intangibles from a business unit approach to analyzing each of the company s significant investment components 
based on this analysis  the remaining purchase price in excess of fair value of the midsouth assets acquired was not recoverable 
a million charge representing long lived assets held for disposal 
certain branch lines on the midsouth route and certain non operating real estate have been designated for sale  and efforts have been initiated by management to procure bids 
approximately million in reserves related to termination of a union productivity fund and employee separations 
the union productivity fund was established in connection with prior collective bargaining agreements and required kcsr to pay employees when reduced crew levels were used 
a million impairment of goodwill associated with the company s investment in berger 
in connection with the company s review of the carrying value of its various assets  management determined that a portion of the intangibles recorded in connection with the berger investment were not recoverable  primarily due to below peer performance and growth of the core berger funds 
a million impairment of assets at pabtex a subsidiary of the company as a result of continued operating losses and a decline in its customer base 
approximately million of other reserves for leases  contracts  impaired investments and other reorganization costs 
based on the company s review of its assets and liabilities  certain charges were recorded to reflect recoverability and or obligation as of december  operating difficulties of the union pacific railroad 
as has been reported in the press  the union pacific railroad up has experienced recent difficulties with its railroad operations  reportedly linked to its recent acquisition of the southern pacific railroad 
up is one of kcsr s largest interchange partners 
the up s difficulties have resulted in overall traffic congestion of the us railroad system and have impacted kcsr s ability to interchange traffic with up  both for domestic and international traffic ie  to and from mexico 
this system congestion has resulted in certain equipment shortages due to kcsr s rolling stock being retained within the up system for unusually extended periods of time  for which up remits car hire amounts 
kcsr agreed to accept certain up trains in diverted traffic to assist in the easing of the up s system congestion  resulting in revenues of approximately million during  which largely offset traffic lost due to congestion on up s line 
the surface transportation board stb issued an emergency service order on october   addressing the deteriorating quality of rail service in the western united states 
key measures in the stb order included granting the tex mex access to houston shippers  access to trackage rights over the more direct algoa route south of houston  and a connection with the burlington northern santa fe railroad at flatonia  texas 
the order took effect on november  and extended for days initially 
the stb extended this order through august  as a result of this emergency service order  tex mex revenues increased during fourth quarter however  expenses associated with accommodating the increase in traffic and congestion related problems of the up system substantially offset this revenue increase 
grupo tfm 
as disclosed previously  grupo tfm  a joint venture of the company and transportacion maritima mexicana  sa de sa tmm  was awarded the right to purchase of the common stock of tfm  sa de sa tfm  formerly ferrocarril del noreste  sa de sa for approximately billion mexican pesos approximately billion us based on the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate on december  
tfm holds the concession to operate over mexico s northeast rail lines for years  with the option of a year extension subject to certain conditions 
as previously disclosed  the remaining of tfm was retained by the mexican government government 
the government has the option of selling its interest through a public offering  or selling it to grupo tfm after october  at the initial share price paid by grupo tfm plus interest computed at the mexican base rate the unidad de inversiones udi published by banco de mexico 
in the event that grupo tfm does not purchase the government s interest in tfm  the government may require tmm and kcsi to purchase the government s holdings in proportion to each partner s respective ownership interest in grupo tfm without regard to the government s interest in grupo tfm see below 
on january   grupo tfm paid the first installment of the purchase price approximately million us based on the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate to the government  representing approximately of the purchase price 
this initial installment of the tfm purchase price was funded by grupo tfm through capital contributions from tmm and the company 
the company contributed approximately million to grupo tfm  of which approximately million was used by grupo tfm as part of the initial installment payment 
the company financed this contribution using borrowings under existing lines of credit 
on june   grupo tfm completed the purchase of of tfm through the payment of the remaining million us to the government 
this payment was funded by grupo tfm using a significant portion of the funds obtained from i senior secured term credit facilities million us  ii senior notes and senior discount debentures million us  iii proceeds from the sale of of grupo tfm to the government approximately million us based on the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate on june   and iv additional capital contributions from tmm and the company approximately million from each partner 
additionally  grupo tfm entered into a million revolving credit facility for general working capital purposes 
the government s interest in grupo tfm is in the form of limited voting right shares  and the purchase agreement includes a call option for tmm and the company  which is exercisable at the original amount in us dollars paid by the government plus interest based on one year us treasury securities 
in february and march  the company entered into two separate forward contracts million in february and million in march to purchase mexican pesos in order to hedge against a portion of the company s exposure to fluctuations in the value of the mexican peso versus the us dollar 
in april  the company realized a million pretax gain in connection with these contracts 
this gain was deferred  and has been accounted for as a component of the company s investment in grupo tfm 
these contracts were intended to hedge only a portion of the company s exposure related to the final installment of the purchase price and not any other transactions or balances 
concurrent with the financing transactions  grupo tfm  tmm and the company entered into a capital contribution agreement contribution agreement with tfm  which includes a possible capital call of million from tmm and the company if certain performance benchmarks  outlined in the agreement  are not met 
the company would be responsible for approximately million of the capital call 
the term of the contribution agreement is three years 
in a related agreement between grupo tfm  tfm and the government  among others  the government has agreed to contribute up to million of equity capital to grupo tfm if tmm and the company are required to contribute under the capital call provisions of the contribution agreement prior to july  in the event the government has not made any contributions by such date  the government has committed up to july  to make additional capital contributions to grupo tfm of up to an aggregate amount of million on a proportionate basis with tmm and the company if capital contributions are required 
any capital contributions to grupo tfm from the government would be used to reduce the contribution amounts required to be paid by tmm and the company pursuant to the contribution agreement 
as of december  no additional contributions from the company have been requested or made 
at december   the company s investment in grupo tfm was approximately million 
with the sale of of grupo tfm to the government  the company s interest in grupo tfm declined from to approximately with tmm and a tmm affiliate owning the remaining 
the company accounts for its investment in grupo tfm under the equity method 
i m rail link 
during  kcsr entered into a marketing agreement with i m rail link  llc  which provides kcsr with access to customers primarily new grain origins in the upper midwest  as well as chicago and minneapolis 
this agreement is similar to a haulage rights agreement  but without the restrictions on traffic 
the company believes this agreement provides kcsr with the ability to increase its traffic  particularly with respect to agricultural and mineral products 
berger ownership interest 
as a result of certain transactions during  the company increased its ownership in berger to 
in january and december  berger purchased  for treasury  the common stock of minority shareholders 
also in december  the company acquired additional berger shares from a minority shareholder through the issuance of kcsi common stock 
these transactions resulted in approximately million of intangibles  which will be amortized over their estimated economic life of years 
however  see discussion of impairment of certain of these intangibles in restructuring  asset impairment and other charges heading above 
in connection with the company s acquisition of a controlling interest of berger in under a stock purchase agreement agreement  the company may be required to make additional purchase price payments up to approximately million of which million remains unpaid  contingent upon berger attaining certain levels up to billion of assets under management  as defined in the agreement  over a five year period 
in  and  additional payments were made totaling  and million  respectively  resulting in adjustment to the purchase price 
the intangible amounts are being amortized over their estimated economic life of years 
stock split and increase in quarterly common stock dividend 
on july   the company s board of directors board authorized a for split in the company s common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the board also voted to increase the quarterly dividend to per share post split 
both dividends were paid on september  to stockholders of record as of august  amounts reported in this form k have been restated to reflect the stock split

the company s board has authorized management to repurchase a total of million shares of kcsi common stock under two programs the program for million shares and the program for nine million shares 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares post split at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
with these transactions  the company has repurchased approximately million shares of its common shares  completing the program and part of the program 
in connection with these programs  the company entered into a forward stock purchase contract in for the repurchase of shares  which was completed during see discussion in financial instruments and purchase commitments below 
gateway western 
kcstc acquired beneficial ownership of the outstanding stock of gateway western in december the stock acquired by kcstc was held in an independent voting trust until the company received approval from the stb on the company s proposed acquisition of gateway western 
the stb issued its approval of the transaction effective may  the consideration paid for gateway western including various acquisition costs and liabilities was approximately million  which exceeded the fair value of the underlying net assets by approximately million 
the resulting intangible is being amortized over a period of years 
because the gateway western stock was held in trust during first quarter  the company accounted for gateway western under the equity method as a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary 
upon stb approval of the acquisition  the company consolidated gateway western in the transporta tion segment 
additionally  the company restated first quarter to include gateway western as a consolidated subsidiary as of january   and results of operations for the year ended december  reflect this restatement 
under a prior agreement with the atchison  topeka santa fe railway company  burlington northern santa fe corporation has the option of purchasing the assets of gateway western based on a fixed formula in the agreement through the year southern capital joint venture 
in october  the company and gatx capital corporation gatx completed the formation and financing of a joint venture to perform certain leasing and financing activities 
the venture  southern capital  was formed through a gatx contribution of million in cash  and a company contribution through its subsidiaries kcsr and carland of million in net assets  comprising a negotiated fair value of locomotives and rolling stock and long term indebtedness owed to kcsi and its subsidiaries 
in an associated transaction  southern leasing corporation an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company prior to dissolution in october  sold to southern capital approximately million of loan portfolio assets and rail equipment 
as a result of these transactions and subsequent repayment by southern capital of indebtedness owed to kcsi and its subsidiaries  the company received cash which exceeded the net book value of its assets by approximately million 
concurrent with the formation of the joint venture  kcsr entered into operating leases with southern capital for the majority of the rail equipment acquired by or contributed to southern capital 
accordingly  this excess fair value over book value is being recognized over the terms of the leases approximately million in the cash received by the company was used to reduce outstanding indebtedness by approximately million  after consideration of applicable income taxes  through repayments on various lines of credit and subsidiary indebtedness 
the company reports its ownership interest in southern capital under the equity method of accounting 
net income was positively impacted as a result of the southern capital transaction 
reduced depreciation and interest expense  together with equity earnings from southern capital  more than offset the increase in fixed lease expense 
note that the reduced depreciation in resulting from this transaction was substantially offset by depreciation associated with capital expenditures during and dst s investment in continuum 
on august   the continuum company  inc continuum  formerly an approximate owned dst unconsolidated equity affiliate  merged with computer sciences corporation csc  a publicly traded company in a tax free share exchange 
in exchange for its ownership interest in continuum  dst received approximately million shares representing an approximate interest of csc common stock 
as a result of the transaction  the company s earnings include approximately million after tax  or per share  representing the company s proportionate share of the one time gain recognized by dst in connection with the merger 
continuum ceased to be an equity affiliate of dst  thereby eliminating any future continuum equity affiliate earnings or losses 
dst recognized equity losses in continuum of million for the first six months of and million for the year ended december  railroad industry trends and competition 
during the period from to  the railroad industry has experienced ongoing consolidation 
specifically  burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation bn sf merged in  as did the up and the chicago and north western transportation company up cnw 
in  the up merged with sp up sp 
in  csx corporation and norfolk southern corporation completed negotiations to purchase parts of conrail  inc  and the stb is currently reviewing the proposed transaction 
finally  in february  the canadian national railway announced its intention to acquire the illinois central corporation 
as these transactions are not completed or have only recently been completed  the company cannot predict their ultimate outcome or effect on kcsr 
however  the company believes that kcsr revenues have been and may be negatively affected by increased competition from these consolidations as a result of diversions of rail traffic away from kcsr lines 
in addition to competition within the railroad industry  highway carriers compete with kcsr throughout its operating area 
since deregulation of the railroad industry  competition has resulted in extensive downward pressure on freight rates 
truck carriers have eroded the railroad industry s share of total transportation revenues 
however  rail carriers  including kcsr  have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace  working together to provide end to end transportation of products 
mississippi and missouri river barge traffic  among others  also competes with kcsr in the transportation of bulk commodities such as grains  steel  and petroleum products 
in response to the changing competitive and business environment in the rail industry  the company revised its accounting methodology for evaluating the recoverability of intangibles from a business unit approach to analyzing each of the company s significant investment components 
based on this analysis  million of the remaining purchase price in excess of fair value of the midsouth corporation assets acquired was not recoverable 
see union labor negotiations below for a discussion of the impact of labor issues and regulations on competition in the transportation industry 
berger joint venture 
during  berger entered into a joint venture agreement with bank of ireland asset management us limited  a subsidiary of bank of ireland  to develop and market a series of international and global mutual funds 
the new venture  named bboi worldwide llc bboi  is headquartered in denver  colorado 
regulatory approvals were received in october  and the first no load mutual fund product the berger biam international fund biam fund was introduced in fourth quarter assets under management for the biam fund totaled million at december  berger accounts for its investment in bboi under the equity method 
union labor negotiations 
approximately of kcsr s and gateway western s combined employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
in  with the exception of employees of the former midsouth  the company effectively settled labor contract disputes with all major railroad unions  including the united transportation union  the brotherhood of locomotive engineers  the transportation communications international union  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees  and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
the provisions of the various labor agreements  which extend to december   generally include periodic general wage increases  lump sum payments to workers  and greater work rule flexibility  among other provisions 
settlement of these labor issues effectively mitigates the possibility of a work stoppage and did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
labor agreements related to employees of the former midsouth covered by collective bargaining agreements reopened for negotiations in these agreements entail nineteen separate groups of employees 
kcsr management is currently in the process of meeting with these unions representing its employees 
while these discussions are ongoing  the company does not anticipate that this process or the resultant labor agreements will have a material impact on its operations or financial conditions 
as a result of these labor agreements completed in  which will result in operating efficiencies  management believes the company is better positioned to compete effectively with alternative forms of transportation  as well as other railroads 
however  railroads remain restricted by certain remaining antiquated operating rules and are thus prevented from achieving optimum productivity with existing technology and systems 
kcsr  gateway and other railroads continue to be affected by labor regulations which are more burdensome than those governing non rail industries  such as trucking competitors 
the railroad retirement act requires up to a contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages  while the social security and medicare acts only require a employer contribution on similar wage bases 
other programs  such as the federal employees liability act fela  when compared to worker s compensation laws  vividly illustrate the competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by federal labor regulations 
dst public offering 
in october and november  dst and the company completed an initial public offering of dst common stock 
in conjunction with the offering  the company completed an exchange of dst shares for shares of kcsi common stock held by the employee stock ownership plan esop 
the company recorded an after tax gain of approximately million during fourth quarter from this transaction  representing per share in fourth quarter and per share for the year ended december  as a result of the offering and associated transactions  the company s ownership in dst decreased to approximately  and the dst investment was accounted for under the equity method retroactive to january  the purpose of the offering was to achieve market recognition of dst s performance as a stand alone entity and to obtain proceeds for the retirement of debt  repurchase of company common stock and general corporate purposes 
the net proceeds to the company from the offering and repayment of indebtedness by dst totaled approximately million  after applicable income taxes 
mexrail investment 
in november  the company purchased of the common stock of mexrail from tmm 
mexrail owns of the tex mex  as well as certain other assets 
the tex mex operates a mile rail line extending from corpus christi to laredo  texas 
the purchase price of million was financed through existing lines of credit 
upon completion of purchase price allocations in  approximately million of intangibles were recorded as the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the underlying net assets 
the intangible amounts are being amortized over a period of years 
the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
as a result of efforts by the company in connection with the up sp merger  the stb  as a condition for approval of the merger  granted the tex mex trackage rights to operate over up lines between corpus christi and beaumont  texas 
in beaumont  the tex mex interchanges with kcsr  effectively extending the kcsr rail network to the mexican border  where it connects with tfm 
as noted earlier  this interchange  together with kcsr s connections with major rail carriers at various other points in the united states and the company s partial ownership of tfm  positions kcsl to be an integral component of the economic integration of the north american marketplace 
kcsr unusual costs 
during the first and second quarters of  kcsr recorded approximately million after tax  or approximately per share  of unusual costs and expenses related to employee separations and other personnel related activities  unusual system operational related expenses  and reserves for contracts  leases and property 
safety and quality programs 
kcsr continued the implementation of important safety and quality programs during  including an extensive  cross functional pro formance initiative focusing on continuous improvements in all aspects of the organization 
as a result of these programs  kcsr has experienced a decline in accident related statistics in recent years 
for the period to  safety and quality programs resulted in a decline in federal railroad administration reportable injuries  a decline in employee lost work days and a decline in total derailments 
related benefits are expected to be recurring in nature and realizable over future years 
safety and quality programs comprise two important ongoing elements of kcsr management s goal of reducing employee injuries 
associated program expenses are not anticipated to have a material impact on operating results in future years 
industry segment results the company s major business activities are classified as follows in millions i ii revenues transportation financial asset management total  operating income loss transportation financial asset management total net income loss transportation financial asset management total i includes million million after tax of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges recorded by the company during fourth quarter the charges reflect impairment of goodwill associated with kcsr s acquisition of midsouth in and the company s investment in berger  long lived assets held for disposal  impaired long lived assets  reserves related to termination of a union productivity fund and employee separations  and other reserves for leases  contracts and reorganization costs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
additionally  transportation results for the year ended include revenues and expenses from gateway western 
ii includes a one time after tax gain of million representing the company s proportionate share of the one time gain recognized by dst in connection with the merger of continuum with computer sciences corporation see note 
consolidated revenues increased million over  reflecting improvements in both the transportation and financial asset management segments year to year 
while total operating income decreased from by  operating income exclusive of the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges increased nearly million  indicative of a higher rate of revenue growth compared to expenses 
the consolidated loss of million for the year ended december  includes million million after tax in restructuring  asset impairment and other charges 
consolidated net income of million for the year ended includes a one time gain of million resulting from the continuum transaction 
exclusive of these amounts  consolidated net income in was million  or  higher than this increase reflects improvement in ongoing operations for both the transportation and the financial asset management segments  primarily from higher revenues and improved operating margins 
consolidated revenues increased million over due to growth in financial asset management assets under management during  partially offset by a decline in transportation revenues 
operating income increased from higher revenues and improved margins in the financial asset management segment 
while consolidated net income decreased by million from  exclusive of the continuum gain in and the gain from the dst public offering in  net income increased million  or 
transportation kcsl the following schedule summarizes transportation earnings  providing a reconciliation to ongoing domestic transportation earnings transportation net income loss restructuring  asset impairment and other charges grupo tfm losses and interest unusual costs ongoing domestic transportation earnings ongoing domestic transportation segment earnings of million for the year ended december  were compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was driven by revenue growth from million to million  chiefly due to higher kcsr revenues and the addition of the gateway western  partially offset by the loss of revenues from southern leasing corporation  which was dissolved in the fourth quarter of in addition  cost containment initiatives by management in the second half of helped to increase operating margins and contributed to higher earnings 
transportation expenses  exclusive of the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges  increased million  or to million for compared with million for the increase is attributable to operating lease expenses resulting from the southern capital transaction and the inclusion of gateway western expenses in variable operating expenses were essentially unchanged year to year 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the transportation segment decreased million from to due to the transfer of assets to southern capital during the fourth quarter of  offset by the inclusion of gateway western 
the increase in transportation interest expense to million is due to interest associated with the investment in grupo tfm  together with interest on gateway western indebtedness  offset by debt repayments associated with the southern capital transaction 
capitalized interest related to the company s grupo tfm investment totaled million for the year ended december   which ceased upon gaining operational control of tfm on june  the transportation segment s contribution to the company s consolidated earnings declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million exclusive of unusual costs of million for the year ended december  the portion of net income attributable to kcsr improved in primarily because of these unusual costs and expenses incurred in which offset revenue declines related to the effect of industry consolidation 
revenues declined million  or  primarily as a result of a decrease in kcsr revenues attributable to lower carloadings related to the competitive pressures from the various rail carrier mergers  a decline in southern leasing revenues and reduced pabtex revenues 
operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  however  if million after tax of certain unusual costs and expenses had been excluded  total operating expenses for would have increased over this increase in is attributable to adverse winter weather in first quarter  train derailment expenses and expenditures associated with kcsr s emphasis on providing improved and reliable customer service 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the transportation segment increased million from to due primarily to capital expenditures 
following is a detailed discussion of the primary subsidiaries comprising the transportation segment 
results of subsidiaries immaterial to the company have been omitted 
the kansas city southern railway company kcsr operates in a nine state region  including missouri  kansas  arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana  and texas 
kcsr has the shortest rail route between kansas city and the gulf of mexico  serving the ports of beaumont and port arthur  texas  and new orleans  baton rouge  reserve and west lake charles  louisiana 
through haulage rights  kcsr accesses the states of nebraska and iowa  and serves the ports of houston and galveston  texas 
kansas city  missouri  as the second largest rail center in the united states  represents an important interchange gateway for kcsr 
kcsr also has interchange gateways in new orleans and shreveport  louisiana  dallas and beaumont  texas  and jackson and meridian  mississippi 
major commodities moved by kcsr include coal  grain and farm products  petroleum  chemicals  paper and forest products  as well as other general commodities 
kcsr competes in the intermodal traffic market  including an east west line running from dallas  texas to meridian  mississippi  which has allowed kcsr to be more competitive in transcontinental intermodal transportation 
additionally  in november  kcsr began dedicated through train service between dallas  texas and meridian  mississippi for intermodal traffic  which competes directly with truck carriers along the interstate corridor  offering service times which are competitive with both truck and other rail carriers 
exclusive of the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges recorded in fourth quarter discussed in results of operation above  kcsr contributed million to the company s consolidated earnings compared to million in this increase is primarily due to a million increase in kcsr revenues offset by a lesser increase in variable and fixed operating costs 
in  kcsr net income totaled million compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the unusual costs and expenses discussed in results of operations above  which reduced kcsr net income by approximately million in exclusive of the unusual costs and expenses  kcsr earnings were lower than  mainly due to reduced revenues and higher operating costs attributable to adverse winter weather in first quarter  train derailment expenses primarily in second quarter  and expenditures associated with kcsr s emphasis on providing improved and reliable customer service 
revenues the following summarizes revenues  carloads and net ton miles of kcsr by commodity mix carloads and revenues intermodal units net ton miles in millions in thousands in millions general commodities chemical and petroleum    paper and forest    agricultural and mineral    other   total general commodities    intermodal units    coal    subtotal    other total    kcsr revenues were million  or  higher than due to a increase in general commodities and a increase in intermodal revenues 
agricultural and mineral products led general commodities with a increase over comprised primarily of domestic and export grain and food products 
kcsr revenues were million  or lower than due to a reduction in general commodities revenues  offset by an increase in intermodal and other revenues 
in particular  revenues decreased in grain traffic  bulk commodities such as non metallic minerals and petroleum coke  and paper forest products 
these lower general commodities revenues were primarily due to a decrease in carloading volumes resulting from competitive pressures from the various rail mergers  offset partially by slightly improved average revenue per carload as a result of changes in the mix of general commodities traffic eg  fewer carloadings of paper forest products compared to chemical and petroleum products in versus 
the following is a discussion of kcsr s major commodity groups 
coal kcsr delivers coal to seven electric generating plants  located at amsterdam  missouri  flint creek  arkansas  welsh  texas  mossville  louisiana  kansas city  missouri  pittsburg  kansas  and hugo  oklahoma 
two coal customers  southwestern electric power company swepco and entergy gulf states formerly gulf states utility company  comprised approximately and of total coal revenues generated by kcsr in and  respectively 
kcsr also delivers lignite to an electric generating plant at monticello  texas tumco 
kcsr s contract with swepco  its largest customer  extends through the year ended coal revenues for the periods presented reflect the historical tendencies of unit coal revenues to equalize on an annual basis 
coal continues to be the largest single commodity handled by kcsr  generating million of revenue in  unchanged from coal traffic comprised of carload revenues and of carloads in compared with and  respectively  in indicating the growth realized in other commodities 
coal revenues decreased million or to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as a result of an overall decrease in unit coal traffic 
coal accounted for of carload revenues in compared with in chemicals and petroleum chemical and petroleum products  serviced via tank and hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast through interchange with other rail carriers  as a combined group represent the largest commodity to kcsr in terms of revenue 
million in versus million in 
this million increase  or increase  results primarily from increased revenues in plastics  miscellaneous chemical  soda ash and petroleum shipments offset by reduced petroleum coke shipments 
chemical and petroleum products accounted for of total carload revenues compared with for these revenues could grow in future years as a result of kcsr s petition seeking approval from the stb for construction of a nine mile rail line connecting the manufacturing facilities of basf corporation  shell chemical company and borden chemical and plastics in geismar  louisiana  a large industrial corridor with several other companies engaged in the petrochemical industry  with kcsr s main line just north of sorrento  louisiana 
chemical and petroleum revenues were essentially unchanged at million in compared with million for as increases in miscellaneous petroleum and soda ash traffic were offset by lower petroleum coke volumes 
chemical and petroleum products accounted for of total carload revenues compared with for paper and forest kcsr  whose rail line runs through the heart of the southeastern us timber producing region  serves eleven paper mills directly including international paper co 
and georgia pacific  among others and six others indirectly through short line connections  and transports pulpwood  woodchips and raw fiber used in the production of paper  pulp and paperboard 
paper and forest products revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million from the year ended december  as a result of increased carloads for lumber plywood and higher revenues per carload for pulpwood and woodchips offset by decreased pulpwood and woodchips carloads 
paper and forest traffic comprised of carload revenues in as compared to in in  paper and forest products revenues decreased million  or  from due to a decline in pulpwood and woodchips carloads 
paper and forest products accounted for of total carload revenues compared with in agricultural and mineral agricultural and mineral products revenues for increased million  or  compared to primarily as a result of higher carloads of grain  especially corn  due to a strong harvest 
additionally  carloads of nonmetallic minerals increased approximately over volume 
agricultural and mineral products accounted for of carload revenues in compared with in during  revenues from agricultural and mineral products declined million  or  compared to  largely from significantly re duced domestic and export grain traffic 
this decline is attributable to traffic diversions resulting from the various rail mergers and the impact of weaker grain movements in early intermodal the intermodal freight business consists of hauling freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water  rail and motor carriers  with rail carriers serving as the links between motor carriers and ports 
in  kcsr increased its share of the us intermodal traffic primarily through the acquisition of the midsouth  which extended the company s east west line running from dallas  texas to shreveport  louisiana to meridian  mississippi 
intermodal revenues for of million increased million  or from revenues of million primarily as a result of in creased carloads  offset by a slight decrease in revenue per carload 
revenues from united parcel service of america  one of kcsr s largest customers  declined slightly due to the international brotherhood of teamsters strike in august  however  the strike s overall impact on kcsr s operating results and financial condition was not material 
during  the company committed to a plan to pursue intermodal business based on operating margin versus growth through carload volume 
intermodal traffic accounted for of carload revenues in compared with in kcsr s intermodal carload volume continued the growth trend experienced in  increasing revenues  due to kcsr s continued marketing efforts to expand east west intermodal traffic  despite a flat intermodal market in general 
certain segments of kcsr s freight traffic  especially intermodal  face highly price and service sensitive competition from trucks  although improvements in railroad operating efficiencies are believed to be lessening the truckers cost advantages 
trucks are not obligated to provide or to maintain rights of way and do not have to pay real estate taxes on their routes 
in recent years  the trucking industry diverted a substantial amount of freight from the railroads as truck operators efficiency over long distances increased 
because fuel costs constitute a larger percentage of the trucking industry s costs  declining fuel prices disproportionately benefit trucking operations as compared to railroad operations 
changing regulations  subsidized highway improve ment programs and favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive position of trucks as an alternative mode of surface transportation for many commodities 
in recent years  railroad industry management has sought avenues for improving its competitive positions  and forged alliances with truck companies in order to move more traffic by rail and provide faster  safer and more efficient service to its customers 
kcsr has streamlined its intermodal operations in the last few years  making its service competitive both in price and service with trucking  and has entered into agreements with several truck companies for through train intermodal service between dallas  texas and meridian  mississippi 
kcsr has increased its intermodal traffic through its connections with eastern railroads 
other kcsr s remaining freight business consists of scrap and slab steel  waste  military equipment and automobiles 
other revenues accounted for of carload revenues during  in and in with no material variances 
costs and expenses the following table summarizes kcsr s operating expenses dollars in millions salaries  wages and benefits fuel material and supplies car hire purchased services casualties and insurance operating leases depreciation and amortization restructuring  asset impairment and other charges other total general kcsr s costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in however  if the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million million after tax in had been excluded  total costs and expenses would have increased only million  or over  primarily as a result of increased fuel costs and operating lease expenses 
diesel fuel usage increased as expected due to both an increase in ton miles and carloads  while fuel prices were essentially unchanged 
costs related to fixed equipment operating leases increased as a result of the southern capital transaction note  however  that the company records equity earnings from southern capital which partially mitigates this increase 
overall  kcsr variable operating expenses  exclusive of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges  declined as a percentage of revenues from indicative of a higher rate of growth for kcsr revenues than costs 
the improved cost structure results from cost containment initiatives implemented by management 
improvements in variable expenses were somewhat offset by increases in fixed expenses  primarily related to lease expenses associated with southern capital in the fourth quarter of  as discussed above 
as discussed in results of operations above  kcsr recorded restructuring  asset impairment and other charges during fourth quarter as a result  salaries and wages expense and depreciation and amortization are expected to decline in despite the decrease in total kcsr revenues in versus  kcsr operating income increased million as a result of a decrease in costs and expenses to million compared to this decrease is attributable to the unusual costs and expenses 
exclusive of the unusual items  costs and expenses were higher than primarily due to adverse winter weather in first quarter  train derailment ex penses  and kcsr s continuing emphasis on providing improved and reliable customer service 
increased costs were evident in salaries and wages  material and supplies and casualties insurance 
kcsr management implemented various cost containment measures during third quarter  which stabilized expenses somewhat in the second half of  particularly in salaries and wages and car hire costs 
fuel kcsr locomotive fuel usage represented of kcsr operating costs in in 
exclusive of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges  locomotive fuel usage represented of operating costs  consistent with fuel costs are affected by traffic levels  efficiency of operations and equipment  and petroleum market conditions 
control of fuel expenses is a constant concern of management  and fuel savings remains a top priority 
to control fuel costs  based on favorable market conditions at the end of  the company entered into purchase commitments for approximately of expected diesel fuel usage 
as a result of increasing fuel prices during  these commitments saved kcsr approximately million 
due to higher fuel prices  minimal commitments were made for roadway maintenance portions of roadway maintenance costs are capitalized and other portions expensed as components of material and supplies  purchased services and other  as appropriate 
expenses aggregated  and million for  and  respectively 
maintenance and capital improvement programs are in conformity with the federal railroad administration s track standards and are accounted for in accordance with the regulatory accounting rules 
management expects to continue to fund roadway maintenance expenditures with internally generated cash flows 
car hire expenses for car hire payable  net of receivables declined million  or for the year ended december  compared to this reduction in net expense results from several factors including better fleet utilization and increased amounts of car hire receivable related to kcsr owned equipment utilization on foreign railroads 
this was particularly evident as a result of the congestion difficulties of the up where kcsr equipment was held on up lines for longer than normal periods 
costs related to car hire in declined to million versus million in  principally resulting from unusual costs and expenses experienced during  discussed elsewhere 
however  these costs also declined in from better fleet utilization and kcsr owned intermodal trailers off line earning car hire 
casualties and insurance casualties and insurance expense declined million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the reduction in casualties and insurance costs from resulted from a reduction in derailment costs and reduced injuries  in part  caused by kcsr ongoing safety initiatives 
excluding the unusual costs and expenses in  costs actually rose for the year ended december  compared to this increase was the direct result of increased derailment related costs  while employee injuries declined 
depreciation and amortization kcsr depreciation and amortization expense declined million  or to million for the year ended december  from million from the year ended december   primarily due to the transfer of assets to southern capital during the fourth quarter of  offset by capital expenditures 
kcsr depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in versus million in due to capital expenditures 
the depreciation savings associated with kcsr s october contribution of locomotives and rolling stock to southern capital was minimal in  but  as discussed above was greater in due to a full year of savings 
operating ratio the operating ratio is a common efficiency measurement among class i railroads 
exclusive of the restructuring  asset impairment and other charges  the impact of kcsr s increased revenues and reduced costs resulted in an improved kcsr operating ratio of for the year ended december   which is below the operating ratio for this reflects the marked improvement made during the last six months of in which the average operating ratio was  as a result of increased margins arising primarily from cost containment initiatives by management 
further  the operating ratio for would have been except for the shifting of interest costs to lease expense as a result of the southern capital transaction 
kcsr s operating ratio decreased to for the year ended december  versus for excluding unusual costs and expenses  the operating ratio would have been  with the increase in largely due to lower revenues and higher costs and expenses as discussed above 
additionally  the southern capital joint venture transaction  while slightly increasing kcsr s overall net income in  raised the operating ratio by approximately one half percent for the year ended as a result of higher equipment lease expense 
the operating ratio for and thereafter has been or will be affected by higher equipment lease expense resulting from the operating leases entered into by kcsr with southern capital 
kcsr interest interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in due to a full year s impact of the debt reduction associated with the southern capital transaction 
interest expense was lower in compared to due to a reduction in debt during the fourth quarter resulting from the southern capital joint venture formation and associated transactions 
gateway western during the year ended december   gateway western contributed million to the company s net income arising from freight revenues of million  offset by operating expenses of million and other expenses of million 
at december   while the company awaited approval from the surface transportation board of kcsi s purchase  gateway western was accounted for under the equity method as a majority owned unconsolidated subsidiary 
unconsolidated affiliates during  the transportation segment s unconsolidated affiliates were comprised primarily of grupo tfm  mexrail  and southern capital 
during  the two primary unconsolidated affiliates were mexrail and southern capital 
during  unconsolidated affiliates were immaterial to the transportation segment s operations 
for the year ended december   the transportation segment recorded a loss of million from unconsolidated affiliates compared to income of million for in  estimated losses of million from june   excluding interest related to grupo tfm were partially offset by equity in earnings from southern capital and mexrail 
grupo tfm experienced higher than expected revenues during based on increased carloads  offset by higher operating expenses necessary to maintain expected customer service levels 
also affecting grupo tfm s results was a write off of a bridge loan commitment fee during of which the company recorded million as its proportionate share 
equity earnings increased to million for from primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of equity earnings from mexrail and two months of equity earnings from southern capital 
other transportation related affiliates and holding company components other subsidiaries in the transportation segment include trans serve  inc  an owner of a railroad wood tie treating facility  pabtex located in port arthur  texas with deep water access to the gulf of mexico  an owner and operator of a bulk materials handling facility which stores and transfers coal and petroleum coke from trucks and rail cars to ships and barges primarily for export  mid south microwave  inc  which owns and leases a  mile industrial frequency microwave transmission system that is the primary communications facility used by kcsr  rice carden corporation and tolmak  inc  both owning and operating various industrial real estate and spur rail trackage contiguous to the kcsr right of way  southern development company  the owner of the executive office building in downtown kansas city  missouri used by kcsi and kcsr  and wyandotte garage  an owner and operator of a parking facility located in downtown kansas city  missouri used by kcsi and kcsr 
during  contributions to net income from other transportation related affiliates decreased million  primarily as a result of million of asset impairment charges recorded during fourth quarter relating to pabtex and certain real estate 
in addition  pabtex continued to experience decreased revenues resulting from the loss of petroleum coke customers 
there were no material changes in these subsidiaries during compared with except for a million decrease in pabtex earnings as a result of the loss of a major customer in december kcsl holding company kcsl holding company costs did not materially change from levels based on amounts attributed to the transportation segment by the kcsi holding company 
during  higher allocated holding company costs  primarily due to the company s activities related to the up sp merger million after tax and business development costs related to the investment in mexico contributed to a decrease in net income in compared with transportation segment trends and outlook since  there has been significant consolidation among major us class i rail carriers 
management believes these recent mergers have negatively impacted revenues  primarily as a result of rail traffic diverted away from kcsr s lines and correspondingly lower carloadings 
while kcsr has begun to show positive revenue growth across most commodity groups  these rail mergers could still have a negative impact on future revenues as a result of increased competition 
assuming no major economic deterioration occurs in the region serviced by the company s transportation segment  management expects revenues and carloads to increase over additionally  kcsr cost containment initiatives are expected to continue into although revenues have been higher than expected during the first year of tfm s operations since june   management expects to continue to record losses from its investment in grupo tfm during  however  these losses are expected to be partially offset by equity earnings from the southern capital and mexrail investments 
financial asset management the financial asset management segment contributed million to the company s consolidated results in  a million decline from exclusive of certain items in both years as discussed in the results of operations section above  however  earnings improved 
revenues increased million over  leading to higher operating income and improved operating margins 
operating margins increased from for the year ended december  to for assets under management increased during  reaching billion at december  further  shareowner accounts exceeded  as of december   a increase over financial asset management contributed million to consolidated earnings 
exclusive of the continuum gain and the gain from the dst public offering  financial asset management earnings increased year to year 
assets under management at december  were higher than year end  fueling a growth in revenues 
although variable operating expenses increased in  the increase was at a lower proportionate rate than revenues  resulting in a improvement in operating income over million in versus million in 
the increase in variable operating expenses was associated with higher business volumes  as well as higher janus performance based compensation 
the following table highlights key information assets under management in billions janus no load funds janus aspen series i idex load funds ii institutional and separately managed accounts total janus berger funds total i the janus aspen series currently consists of eleven portfolios offered through variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts  and certain qualified pension plans ii janus serves as subadvisor to five of the idex funds  whose assets are included herein in millions revenues janus berger operating income loss janus berger net income loss janus berger financial asset management revenue and operating income increases are a direct result of increases in assets under management 
assets under management and shareholder accounts have grown in recent years from a combination of new money investments ie  fund sales and market appreciation 
fund sales have risen in response to marketing efforts  favorable fund performance  introduction and market reception of new products  and the current popularity of no load mutual funds 
market appreciation has resulted from increases in investment values 
janus capital corporation janus assets under management increased during  resulting in a increase in revenues and a increase in operating income 
this increase in assets under management to billion as of december  was a result of fund sales net of redemptions of billion and market appreciation of billion 
total janus shareowner accounts grew during to million 
as a result of a slower rate of growth in expenses compared to revenues during  operating margins improved to for versus in comparable janus experienced an increase in salaries and wages expense  primarily from a higher number of employees in and variable compensation tied to investment and financial performance 
additionally  alliance fees increased due to a greater amount of assets being distributed through these channels 
approximately of janus operating expenses consist of variable costs that generally increase or decrease in association with revenue generated from assets under management 
an additional of operating expenses principally marketing  pension plan contributions and temporary help are discretionary 
janus revenues  operating income and net income increased significantly over  largely due to growth in assets under management since december  fund sales net of redemptions of billion  coupled with market appreciation  raised total assets under management to billion at december  the value of net assets in the janus funds increased to billion at december  versus billion at december  shareowner accounts grew to million  a increase over operating expenses increased as a result of higher business volumes  together with increases in incentive and variable compensation as a result of strong investment and financial performance 
however  operating expenses declined as a percent of revenue due to successful cost containment efforts  including a million decrease in promotional and marketing expenses from due to a more focused marketing approach 
additionally  depreciation and amortization costs declined approximately million due to the disposal of equipment during general increases in assets under management in and are attributable to several factors including  among others i strong securities markets  particularly equities  ii favorable investment performance  particularly among janus global and international investment products  iii effective marketing and public relations  iv effective use of third party distribution for both retail and sub advised products  and v a strong brand awareness in the direct channel 
the janus funds are marketed to pension plan sponsors through alliance arrangements with record keeping organizations and by participating in mutual fund supermarkets 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of janus total assets under management were generated through such alliance arrangements and mutual fund supermarkets 
janus also markets advisory services directly to insurance companies  banks and brokerage firms for their proprietary investment products  and directly with private individuals  foundations  defined benefit pension plans and other organizations 
these areas accounted for  and billion in assets under management at december   and  respectively 
janus introduced the following funds during the three year period ended december  janus aspen capital appreciation portfolio  janus aspen equity income portfolio janus aspen high yield portfolio  janus equity income fund  janus special situations fund janus olympus fund  janus high yield fund  janus money market funds berger associates  inc 
berger reported a net loss of million in excluding the charges associated with the impairment of goodwill associated with the company s investment in berger and reserves for certain contracts as discussed in results of operations above  berger reported a net loss of million in compared to a loss of million in assets under management increased to billion at december  from billion at december   resulting in a slight increase in revenues year to year 
operating costs  however  increased more than revenues thereby resulting in a higher net loss than prior year 
higher expenses were evident in consulting fees  advertising and amortization of intangibles 
shareholder accounts declined from  totaling  at december  as discussed in the results of operations  in  the company increased its ownership in berger to through several transactions by berger and the company 
the company recorded approximately million of intangibles as a result of these transactions 
in connection with the company s review of the recoverability of its assets  the company determined that million of goodwill associated with berger was not recoverable as of december   primarily due to below peer performance and growth of the core berger funds 
accordingly  a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the repurchase of berger minority interest was charged to expense 
berger contributed a net loss of million to consolidated earnings in assets under management increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december   leading to an increase in revenues 
however  increased operating costs  partially due to amortization associated with intangibles  more than offset this increase in revenues 
amortization increased as a result of the million payment made in may pursuant to the berger stock purchase agreement as discussed in results of operations above 
additionally  interest expense was higher than due to indebtedness incurred to fund the may contingency payment 
shareholder accounts totaled  at december   a slight decrease from year end general during  berger introduced four new funds the berger small cap value fund  the berger balanced fund  the berger mid cap fund  and the berger select fund 
these funds held approximately million of assets under management at december  while the berger fund fund experienced a decline in assets under management during primarily related to below peer performance all other berger funds reported growth in assets 
berger made certain changes in the portfolio management of the fund during management believes these changes will improve berger s opportunity for growth in the future 
both the berger small company growth fund and the berger new generation fund reported steady growth in assets under management throughout cumulatively increasing from year end 
however  the berger fund and the berger growth and income fund  together representing over of total berger assets under management  performed below their respective peer groups  and their total assets under management decreased since december  as discussed in results of operations above  berger entered into a joint venture bboi to introduce a series of international and global mutual funds 
the first no load mutual fund product  an international equity fund  was introduced in fourth quarter total bboi assets under management at december  were million 
berger accounts for its investment in bboi under the equity method 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of berger s total assets under management were generated through mutual fund supermarkets 
other financial asset management related affiliates and holding company components equity in earnings of dst equity in net earnings of dst for the year ended december  totaled million 
exclusive of the one time gain on the continuum merger discussed in results of operations above  equity earnings from dst increased year to year 
this increase in dst earnings reflects an increase in dst revenues compared to improvements in both domestic and international revenues and improved operating margins in versus in 
equity in net earnings of dst totaled million for the year ended december  this total includes kcsi s proportionate share of the dst one time gain on the continuum merger discussed in results of operations above 
exclusive of this non recurring item  equity earnings from dst of million decreased approximately from the million in this decrease is attributable to a lower percentage ownership of dst in versus as discussed earlier 
in addition to the gain on the continuum merger  comparisons of dst earnings in versus were affected by several factors  including i a after tax gain of million associated with dst s sale of an equity investment  investors fiduciary trust company holdings  inc  ii lower fourth quarter equity earnings due to an estimated million loss recorded by dst in connection with acquisition related expenses of dst s continuum investment  iii the first quarter effect of a million non recurring charge related to continuum  iv a increase in revenues over  and v a million decline in interest costs from kcsi holding company kcsi holding company results did not materially change from through based on amounts that were not attributed to the transportation segment by the kcsi holding company 
fluctuations year to year in costs and expenses and interest expense have been essentially offset by changes in interest income and other income 
results include a million reserve related to a non core investment entity of the company 
financial asset management trends and outlook future growth of the company s financial asset management revenues and operating income will be largely dependent on prevailing financial market conditions  relative performance of janus and berger s products  introduction and market reception of new products  as well as other factors  including changes in the stock and bond markets  increases in the rate of return of alternative investments  increasing competition as the number of mutual funds continues to grow  and changes in marketing and distribution channels 
costs and expenses should continue at operating levels consistent with the rate of growth  if any  in revenues 
interest expense consolidated interest expense increased in to million compared to million in this increase is attributable to higher average debt balances throughout  primarily resulting from borrowings incurred to fund the company s investment in grupo tfm and first quarter common stock repurchases 
interest expense related to the indebtedness incurred in connection with the company s investment in grupo tfm was capitalized until the final installment of the tfm purchase price was made june  
capitalized interest totaled million for the year ended december  consolidated interest expense decreased in to million versus million in this decrease resulted from lower average debt balances throughout  largely due to lower year end debt balances as a result of the repayment of indebtedness using the proceeds received in connection with the dst public offering and associated transactions 
additionally  interest savings from the october southern capital joint venture formation and associated transactions substantially offset interest associated with borrowings throughout used to repurchase company common stock 
management expects interest expense to be higher in compared to because the company will not capitalize any interest in associated with the borrowings in connection with the company s investment in grupo tfm 
however  as a significant portion of the company s debt at december  represents fixed rate debt instruments  the company s risk to increasing interest rates is somewhat mitigated 
other  net generally  modest fluctuations have occurred within this component from to the decrease in from is partially attributable to the one time gain of approximately million recorded by kcsr in connection with the sale of real estate 
the increase in from is largely due to this one time gain  partially offset by higher interest income from advances to dst throughout the first nine months of liquidity operating cash flows 
the company s cash flow from operations has historically been positive and sufficient to fund operations  kcsr roadway capital improvements and debt service 
external sources of cash principally negotiated bank debt  public debt and sales of investments have typically been used to fund acquisitions  new investments  equipment additions and company stock repurchases 
the following table summarizes consolidated operating cash flow information 
financial information for the year ended december  was restated to reflect dst as an unconsolidated affiliate as of january  due to the dst public offering and associated transactions completed in november  which reduced the company s ownership in dst to approximately

investing cash flows 
cash was used for the following investing activities i property acquisitions of  and million in  and  respectively  and ii investments in and loans with affiliates of  and million in  and  respectively 
included in the investments in affiliates total was the company s approximate million capital contribution to grupo tfm 
due to growth throughout and  janus had invested an additional and million in short term investments representing invested cash at december  and  respectively 
also  cash received during in connection with the southern capital joint venture formation and associated transactions approximately million  after consideration of related income taxes is included as proceeds from disposal of property and from disposal of other investments based on the underlying assets contributed sold to southern capital 
in  the dst stock offering and debt repayment to kcsi resulted in million of proceeds to the company prior to payment of income taxes  which occurred in 
generally  operating cash flows and borrowings under lines of credit have been used to finance property acquisitions and investments in and loans with affiliates during the period from to financing cash flows 
financing cash flows include i borrowings of  and million in  and  respectively  ii repayment of indebtedness in the amounts of  and million in  and  respectively  and iii cash dividends of  and million in  and  respectively 
debt proceeds were used to fund the million grupo tfm capital contribution  repurchase company common stock million and for additional investment in berger million

debt proceeds in were used for stock repurchases million and subsidiary refinancing and working capital million 
repayment of indebtedness includes scheduled maturities and reductions of outstanding lines of credit 
in  operating cash flows were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s lines of credit 
in  proceeds approximately million  after consideration of income taxes received in connection with the southern capital joint venture formation and associated transactions were used to repay outstanding amounts under the company s lines of credit 
in  proceeds received from the dst public offering and repayment by dst of indebtedness to kcsi were used to repay outstanding amounts under existing lines of credit 
repurchases of company common stock during the three year period ended december  were funded with borrowings under existing lines of credit as noted above  proceeds received from the dst public offering and repayment by dst of indebtedness to kcsi  and the million dividend from dst in see discussion under financial instruments and purchase commitments for information relative to certain anticipated cash expenditures 
capital structure capital requirements 
the company has traditionally funded kcsr capital expenditures using equipment trust certificates for major purchases of locomotive and rolling stock  while using internally generated cash flows or leasing for other equipment 
capital improvements for kcsr roadway track structure have historically been funded with cash flows from operations 
capital requirements for janus  berger  kcsi holding company and other subsidiaries have been funded with cash flows from operations and negotiated term financing 
with the formation of southern capital  the company has the ability to finance railroad equipment through the joint venture 
capital programs from to were primarily financed through internally generated cash flows 
these sources were used to finance kcsr capital expenditures in million  million and million 
the same sources used in funding capital programs are expected to be used in funding capital programs  currently estimated at million 
in the last several years  janus has upgraded its customer service capabilities through new equipment and technology enhancements  generally funded with existing cash flows and negotiated indebtedness  when necessary 
overall  however  the company s financial asset management businesses require minimal capital for operations 
capital 
components of capital are shown as follows in millions debt due within one year long term debt total debt stockholders equity total debt plus equity    total debt as a percent of total debt plus equity the company s consolidated debt ratio total debt as a percent of total debt plus equity increased by from december  to december  total debt increased million during  primarily as a result of borrowings to fund the company s investment in grupo tfm and common stock repurchases  partially offset by repayments on outstanding lines of credit 
stockholders equity decreased by million  reflecting the company s net loss for and essentially offsetting capital stock transactions eg  issuances of common stock  common stock repurchases  non cash equity adjustments related to unrealized gains net of tax on available for sale securities  etc the combination of increased debt and reduced equity resulted in a higher consolidated debt ratio in than the company s consolidated debt ratio decreased slightly as of december  to versus at december  total debt at december  of million was million higher than significant repurchases of company common stock million using borrowings under the company s lines of credit were essentially offset by the reduction in debt resulting from the southern capital joint venture formation and associated transactions 
equity increased as a result of net income  issuance of common stock from option exercises and other stock plans  and a positive non cash equity adjustment related to unrealized gains net of tax on available for sale securities held by affiliates  primarily dst 
these increases were largely offset by the company s common stock repurchases and dividends 
the decrease in the debt ratio as of december  compared to was due to this increase in equity  together with essentially unchanged debt levels 
debt securities registration and offerings 
the us securities and exchange commission declared the company s registration statement on form s file no 
 originally filed on september  effective april   registering million in securities 
however  no securities have been issued 
the securities may be offered in the form of common stock  new series preferred stock par value  convertible debt securities  or other debt securities collectively  the securities 
net proceeds from the sale of the securities would be added to the general funds of the company and used principally for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions of or investments in businesses and assets 
on december   the company issued million of debentures due the debentures are redeemable at the option of the company at any time  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of such debentures or b the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debentures agreement plus basis points  and in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
the net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay indebtedness on the company s existing lines of credit and for acquisition of kcsi common stock 
kcsi credit agreements 
on may   the company established a credit agreement in the amount of million 
the credit agreement replaced approximately million of then existing company credit agreements which had been in place for varying periods since proceeds of the facility have been and are anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes 
the agreement contains a facility fee ranging from 
per annum  interest rates below prime and terms ranging from one to five years 
the company also has various other lines of credit totaling million 
these additional lines  which are available for general corporate purposes  have interest rates below prime and terms of less than one year 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its various lines of credit 
as discussed earlier  the company funded its proportionate amount approximately million of the initial tfm purchase price payment made by grupo tfm to the mexican government using borrowings under its lines of credit 
minority purchase agreements 
agreements between kcsi and certain janus minority owners contain  among other provisions  mandatory stock purchase provisions whereby under certain circumstances  kcsi would be required to purchase the minority interest of janus 
the purchase prices of these mandatory stock purchase provisions are based upon a multiple of earnings and or fair market value determinations depending upon specific agreement terms 
if all of the provisions of the janus minority owner agreements became effective  kcsi would be required to purchase the respective minority interests at a cost currently estimated at approximately million 
overall liquidity 
during the to period  the company continued to strengthen its strategic positions in the transportation and financial asset management businesses 
completion of the dst stock offering improved the company s financial position 
based on dst s stated dividend policy  the company does not anticipate receiving any dividends from dst in the foreseeable future 
additionally  the southern capital joint venture transactions  which resulted in repayment of the majority of borrowings then outstanding under the company s lines of credit  provided the company with flexibility as to future financing requirements eg  the investment in grupo tfm 
the company s credit agreements contain  among other provisions  various financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with these various provisions  including the financial covenants  as of december  because of certain financial covenants contained in the credit agreements  however  maximum utilization of the company s available lines of credit may be restricted 
the company believes it has adequate resources available including sufficient lines of credit within the financial covenants referred to above  businesses which have historically been positive cash flow generators  and the million shelf registration statement to meet anticipated operating  capital and debt service requirements  as well as for other potential business opportunities that the company is currently pursuing 
as discussed earlier  there exists a possible capital call million if certain grupo tfm benchmarks are not met 
as discussed in the results of operations section above  tmm and the company could be required to purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm in proportion to each partner s respective ownership interest in grupo tfm without regard to the mexican government s interest in grupo tfm  however  this provision is not exercisable prior to october  also  the mexican government s interest in grupo tfm may be called by tmm and the company  exercisable at the original amount in us dollars paid by the government plus interest based on one year us treasury securities 
as previously discussed in the recent developments section above  the company announced a planned separation of its transportation and financial asset management businesses 
the company is pursuing this separation as a spin off of the financial asset management businesses subject to receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the irs 
this transaction may affect the liquidity and capital structure of the company 
the company is working on addressing the liquidity and capital structure issues that may result from the completion of the proposed transaction  but has not reached any definitive plans 
nonetheless  any such separation may have a material effect on the liquidity and capital of the company 
other year costs 
many existing computer programs and microprocessors that use only two digits rather than four to identify a year could fail or create erroneous results if not corrected to reflect as the year this computer program flaw is expected to affect all companies and organizations  either directly through a company s own programs or indirectly through customers vendors of the company 
the company is currently in the process of implementing year plans  and is analyzing and remediating the millions of lines of code throughout the company s system 
the company is also evaluating all enhanced systems from the mainframe to the desktop 
in addition  the company is reviewing the legal  audit  and regulatory concerns surrounding the year comprehensive corporate tracking  coordination and monitoring is provided by a central project office 
these year related issues are of particular importance to the company 
the company depends upon its computer and other systems and the computer and the other systems of third parties to conduct and manage the company s business 
additionally  the company s products and services are heavily dependent upon using accurate dates in order to function properly 
these year related issues may also adversely affect the operations and financial performance of one or more of the company s customers or suppliers 
as a result  the failure of the company s computer and other systems  products or services  the computer systems and other systems upon which the company depends  or the company s customers or suppliers to be year ready could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in early  the company redirected a number of its employees who were working on developing new products and services for the company to address the year issue 
in addition  the company contracted with third party consultants to assist in the project 
these employees and contractors are supervised by a member of the company s senior management  and the progress is regularly reported to management and the board of directors 
the company s year project includes identifying  evaluating and resolving potential year related issues in the company s computer systems  products  services  other systems and third party systems 
as part of resolving any potential year issues  the company expects to identify all computer systems  products  services and other systems including systems provided by third parties that must be modified  evaluate the alternatives available to make any identified systems  products or services year ready including modification  replace ment or abandonment  and conduct adequate testing of the systems  products and services  including interoperability testing with clients and key organizations in the financial services industry 
the company is also in the process of identifying alternative plans in the event that the year project is not completed on a timely basis or otherwise does not meet the company s anticipated needs 
the company has already begun remediating certain systems and initiated testing and anticipates to have finalized much of the pro cedures relative to the year project by the end of the calendar year based on current estimates of potential costs  the company anticipates spending approximately million in connection with ensuring that all company and subsidiary computer programs are compatible with year requirements 
current accounting principles require all costs associated with year issues to be expensed as incurred 
a portion of these costs will not result in an increase in expense to the company because it will be using existing employees and equipment 
while the company is currently pursuing discussions with its various customers  partners and vendors with respect to their preparedness for year issues  no assurance can be made that all such parties will be year ready 
while the company cannot fully determine its impact  the inability to complete year readiness for its computer systems could result in significant difficulties in processing and completing fundamental transactions 
in such an event  the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
however  the company does not anticipate that business operations will be disrupted or that its customers will experience interruption in the service of its transportation or financial asset management businesses 
financial instruments and purchase commitments 
during  the company entered into a forward stock purchase contract as a means of securing a potentially favorable price for the repurchase of six million shares of its common stock 
during and  the company purchased post split and million shares  respectively  under this contract at an aggregate cost of and million including transaction premium  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward purchase commitments for diesel fuel as a means of securing volumes and reducing overall cost 
the contracts required the company to purchase certain quantities of diesel fuel at defined prices established at the origination of the contract 
as noted earlier  these commitments saved kcsr approximately million in operating expenses in based on higher fuel prices in  minimal commitments were negotiated for however  beginning in  kcsr initiated a fuel hedging program for approximately two million gallons of fuel each month through the end of for approximately of anticipated fuel usage 
additionally  kcsr has entered into purchase commitments for fuel aggregating approximately of total expected usage 
these transactions are intended to mitigate the impact of rising fuel prices and will be recorded using hedge accounting as set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
in general  the company enters into transactions such as those discussed above in limited situations based on management s assessment of current market conditions and perceived risks 
historically  the company has engaged in very few such transactions and their impact has been insignificant 
however  the company intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions in order to manage risks and exposures associated with the company s various operations  and in doing so  may enter into transactions similar to those discussed above 
foreign exchange matters 
in connection with the company s investment in grupo tfm  a mexican company  matters arise with respect to financial accounting and reporting for foreign currency transactions and for translating foreign currency financial statements from mexican pesos into us dollars 
the company follows the requirements outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation sfas  and related authoritative guidance 
the purchase price paid by grupo tfm for of the common stock of tfm was fixed in mexican pesos  accordingly  grupo tfm was exposed to fluctuations in the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate 
in the event that the proceeds from the various financing arrangements did not provide funds sufficient for grupo tfm to complete the purchase of tfm  the company may have been required to make additional capital contributions to grupo tfm 
accordingly  in order to hedge a portion of the company s exposure to fluctuations in the value of the mexican peso versus the us dollar  the company entered into two separate forward contracts to purchase mexican pesos million in february and million in march in april  the company realized a million pretax gain in connection with these contracts 
this gain was deferred and has been accounted for as a component of the company s investment in grupo tfm 
these contracts were intended to hedge only a portion of the company s exposure related to the final installment of the purchase price and not any other transactions or balances 
mexico s economy is currently classified as highly inflationary as defined in sfas accordingly  the us dollar is assumed to be grupo tfm s functional currency  and any gains or losses from translating grupo tfm s financial statements into us dollars will be included in the determination of its net income 
any equity earnings or losses from grupo tfm included in the company s results of operations will reflect the company s share of such translation gains and losses 
the company continues to evaluate existing alternatives with respect to utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge its us dollar investment in grupo tfm as market conditions change or exchange rates fluctuate 
at december   the company had no outstanding foreign currency hedging instruments 
new accounting pronouncements 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no

disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas were issued 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements

the reporting and disclosure required by these statements must be included in the company s financial statements beginning in the company is reviewing sfas and sfas and expects to adopt them by the required dates  which are december  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share sfas in the statement specifies the computation  presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share 
the statement requires the computation of earnings per share under two methods basic and diluted 
basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period ie  the denominator used in the basic calculation is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares had been issued 
the company has presented basic and diluted per share amounts for income from continuing operations and for net income on the face of the income statement and restated all prior period earnings per share data pursuant to sfas in issue no 
 the emerging issues task force  eitf of the financial accounting standards board  reached a consensus that substantive minority rights which provide the minority shareholder with the right to effectively control significant decisions in the ordinary course of an investee s business could impact whether the majority shareholder should consolidate the investee 
management is currently evaluating the rights of the minority shareholders of certain consolidated subsidiaries to determine the impact  if any  that application of eitf will have on the company s consolidated financial statements in the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas effective january  the statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill  as well as for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles which are to be disposed 
if events or changes in circumstances of a long lived asset indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  the company must estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest is lower than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss must be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
see  however  results of operations section above with respect to certain kcsr assets held for disposal as of december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas in october this statement allows companies to continue under the approach set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  for recognizing stock based compensation expense in the financial statements  but encourages companies to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
the company has elected to retain its current accounting approach under apb  and has presented the applicable pro forma disclosures pursuant to the requirements of sfas in note  stockholders equity  to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
had compensation cost for the company s stock based compensation plans been determined in accordance with sfas for options issued after december   the company s net income and earnings per share  on a pro forma basis  would have been million and per share  respectively  for  million and per share  respectively  for  and million and per share  respectively  for litigation 
the company and its subsidiaries are involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
while the ultimate outcome of the various legal proceedings involving the company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management after consultation with legal counsel that the company s litigation reserves are adequate and that these legal actions currently are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
bogalusa cases in july  the company was named as one of twenty seven defendants in various lawsuits in louisiana and mississippi arising from the explosion of a rail car loaded with chemicals in bogalusa  louisiana on october  as a result of the explosion  nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen were released into the atmosphere over parts of that town and the surrounding area causing evacuations and injuries 
approximately  residents of louisiana and mississippi have asserted claims to recover damages allegedly caused by exposure to the chemicals 
the company neither owned nor leased the rail car or the rails on which it was located at the time of the explosion in bogalusa 
the company did  however  move the rail car from jackson to vicksburg  mississippi  where it was loaded with chemicals  and back to jackson where the car was tendered to the illinois central railroad company ic 
the explosion occurred more than days after the company last transported the rail car 
the car was loaded by the shipper in excess of its standard weight when it was transported by the company to interchange with the ic 
the lawsuits arising from the chemical release have been scheduled for trial in the fall of the company sought dismissal of these suits in the trial courts  which was denied in each case 
appeals are pending in the appellate courts of louisiana and mississippi 
the company believes that its exposure to liability in these cases is remote 
if the company were to be found liable for punitive damages in these cases  such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
environmental matters 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under environmental protection laws concerning  among other things  discharges to waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials where environmental risks are inherent 
in particular  the company is subject to various laws and certain legislation including  among others  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  the toxic substances control act  the federal water pollution control act  and the hazardous materials transportation act 
this legislation generally imposes joint and several liability for clean up and enforcement costs  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site 
the company does not foresee that compliance with the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will impair its competitive capability or result in any material additional capital expenditures  operating or maintenance costs 
as part of serving the petroleum and chemicals industry  kcsr transports hazardous materials and has a shreveport  louisiana based hazardous materials emergency team available to handle environmental issues which might occur in the transport of such materials 
additionally  the company performs ongoing review and evaluation of the various environmental issues that arise in the company s operations  and  as necessary  takes actions to limit the company s exposure to potential liability 
in november  representatives of kcsr met with representatives of the united states environmental protection agency epa at the site of two  contiguous pieces of property in north baton rouge  louisiana  abandoned leaseholds of western petrochemicals and export drum 
these properties had been the subjects of voluntary clean up prior to epa s involvement 
the site visit prompted kcsr to obtain from epa  through the freedom of information act  a preliminary assessment report concerning the properties  dated january   and directing a site investigation 
epa s november  visit to the site was the start of that site investigation 
during the november site visit  epa indicated it intended to recover  through litigation  all of its investigation and remediation costs 
at kcsr s request  epa has agreed informally to suspend its investigation pending an exchange of information and negotiation of kcsr s participation in the site investigation 
based upon recent oral advise subsequently received form the abandoned sites division of the louisiana department of environmental quality ladeq  kcsr reasonably expects that it will be allowed to undertake the investigation and remediation of the site  pursuant to the ladeq s guidelines and oversight 
epa s involvement and the investigation and remediation of the sites pursuant to ladeq s oversight and guidelines will increase the ultimate costs to kcsr beyond those anticipated 
however  those additional costs are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
as previously reported  kcsr has been named as a potentially responsible party by the louisiana department of environmental quality in a state environmental proceeding  louisiana department of environmental quality  docket no 
ias a  involving a location near bossier city  louisiana  which was the site of a wood preservative treatment plant lincoln creosoting 
kcsr is a former owner of part of the land in question 
this matter was the subject of a trial in the us district court in shreveport  louisiana which was concluded in july the court found that joslyn manufacturing company joslyn  an operator of the plant  was and is required to indemnify kcsr for damages arising out of plant operations 
kcsr s potential liability is as a property owner rather than as a generator or transporter of contaminants 
the case was appealed to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit  which court affirmed the us district court ruling in favor of kcsr 
in early  the epa added the lincoln creosoting site to its cercla national priority list 
since major remedial work has been performed at this site by joslyn  and kcsr has been held by the federal district and appeals courts to be entitled to indemnity for such costs  it would appear that kcsr should not incur significant remedial liability 
at this time  it is not possible to evaluate the potential consequences of further remediation at the site 
the louisiana department of transportation ldot has sued kcsr and a number of other defendants in louisiana state court to recover clean up costs incurred by ldot while constructing interstate highway at shreveport  louisiana louisiana department of transportation v 
the kansas city southern railway company  et al  case no 
b in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana 
the clean up was associated with an old oil refinery site  operated by the other named defendants 
kcsr s main line was adjacent to that site  and kcsr was included in the suit because ldot claims that a derailment on the adjacent track released hazardous substances onto the site 
however  there is evidence that the derailment occurred on the side of the track opposite from the refinery site 
furthermore  there appears to be no relationship between the lading on the derailed train and any contaminants identified at the site 
therefore  management believes that the company s exposure is limited 
in another proceeding  louisiana department of environmental quality  docket no 
ie  kcsr was named as a party in the alleged contamination of capitol lake in baton rouge  louisiana 
during  the list of potentially responsible parties was significantly expanded to include the state of louisiana  and the city and parish of baton rouge  among others 
studies commissioned by kcsr indicate that contaminants contained in the lake were not generated by kcsr 
management and counsel do not believe this proceeding will have a material effect on the company 
in the ilada superfund site located in east cape girardeau  ill  kcsr was cited for furnishing one carload of used oil to this petroleum recycling facility 
counsel advises that kcsr s liability  if any  should fall within the de minimus provisions of the superfund law  representing minimal exposure 
the mississippi department of environmental quality mdeq initiated a demand on all railroads operating in mississippi to clean up their refueling facilities and investigate any soil and groundwater impacts resulting from past refueling activities 
kcsr has six facilities located in mississippi 
kcsr has developed a plan  together with the state of mississippi  that will satisfy the mdeq s initiative 
estimated costs to complete the studies and expected remediation have been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements and the resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company has recorded liabilities with respect to various environmental issues  which represent its best estimates of remediation and restoration costs that may be required to comply with present laws and regulations 
at december   these recorded liabilities were not material 
although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
regulatory influence 
in addition to the environmental agencies mentioned above  kcsr operations are regulated by the stb  various state regulatory agencies  and the occupational safety and health administration osha 
prior to january   the interstate commerce commission icc had jurisdiction over interstate rates charged  routes  service  issuance or guarantee of securities  extension or abandonment of rail lines  and consolidation  merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers 
as of january   congress abolished the icc and transferred regulatory responsibility to the stb 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety and in some instances  intrastate freight rates 
osha has jurisdiction over certain health and safety features of railroad operations 
kcsr expects its railroad operations to be subject to future requirements regulating exhaust emissions from diesel locomotives that may increase its operating costs 
during the epa issued proposed regulations applicable to locomotive engines 
these regulations  which were issued as final in early  will be effective in stages for new or remanufactured locomotive engines installed after year kcsr is reviewing these new regulations 
however  management does not expect that compliance with these new regulations will have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
financial asset management businesses are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements including  but not limited to  the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission  and the guidelines set forth by the national association of securities dealers 
the company does not foresee that compliance with the requirements imposed by these agencies standards under present statutes will impair its competitive capability or result in any material effect on results of operations 
inflation 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations in the past three years 
generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical costs 
replacement cost and related depreciation expense of the company s property would be substantially higher than the historical costs reported 
any increase in expenses from these fixed costs  coupled with variable cost increases due to significant inflation  would be difficult to recover through price increases given the competitive environments of the company s principal subsidiaries 
see foreign exchange matters above with respect to inflation in mexico 
strategic review 
kcsi  as a holding company  is responsible for the management of its primary assets investments in its subsidiaries 
accordingly  kcsi management continually evaluates how to utilize the strength of the company s business lines and capabilities  provide for future growth opportunities  and achieve the company s financial objectives 
this process has resulted in many significant actions  including the company s investment and involvement in the mexican rail privatization  the december gateway western acquisition  the october southern capital joint venture transactions  the current common stock repurchase program  a continuing commitment to the mutual fund industry  and the october dst public offering 
the company s recent announcement to separate its transportation and financial asset management segments continues this process 
a separation of the two segments through a spin off of the financial asset management businesses would allow management of each segment to focus on achieving their full potential as stand alone entities 
through have been  and future years will be  affected by these strategic activities 
kcsi management s analysis and evaluation of the company s strategic alternatives are expected to continue to present growth opportunities in future years
