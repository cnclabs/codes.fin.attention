operating results by industry segment the company operates in two industry segments i housewares products and ii home improvement products 
housewares the housewares segment significantly improved its profitability in operating profit of million was achieved compared to pro forma for the tamor acquisition operating profits in of million 
the improvement resulted primarily from a increase in net sales and a drop in the cost of plastic resin of per pound or million as compared to other factors adding to the improvement were better utilization of existing capacity  allowing for the reduction in outside molding  and holding selling and marketing expenses steady in spite of the increase in sales 
operating profit of 
million in was up million as compared to a loss in  of million 
the improvement resulted from higher gross profit margins and reduced operating expenses 
the majority of the operating initiatives and cost cutting measures of the prior two years benefited the housewares segment 
the selfix line of products was significantly streamlined from nearly  sku s in to under as of the end of the reduction in sku s has allowed management to concentrate on selling more profitable products  allocate capital resources accordingly and cutback personnel

home improvement products operating profit of the home improvement segment remained flat from to at 
million 
sales for decreased million as a result of postponed remodeling projects by end users

million declined from 
million in the decline in profitability occurred primarily in the first quarter when sales were significantly constrained by weather conditions in the midwest and northeast 
late winter storms deferred the start of the building season 
this resulted in missed sales and significant unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs 
although sales caught up later in the year  the unabsorbed manufacturing costs could not be recovered 
in addition  operating expenses increased to support new product introductions and to pursue new trade channel opportunities 
during the fourth quarter  management initiated a series of changes to permanently reduce manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
this resulted in a fourth quarter profit as compared to historical fourth quarter losses 
further  these changes positioned the home improvement segment for improved profitability in seymour acquisition effective december   within the company s fiscal year the company acquired seymour  a privately held company originally founded in seymour is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of consumer laundry care products 
seymour manufactures and markets a full line of ironing boards  ironing board covers and pads and numerous laundry related accessories 
seymour was acquired for a total purchase price of million  consisting of million in cash  million in common stock  shares and the assumption of million of debt 
the necessary funds to complete the acquisition were obtained from a credit agreement entered into on december   the credit agreement  with the lenders which are parties thereto and general electric capital corporation gecc 
the financing facilities under the credit agreement consist of a million revolving credit facility and two term loans totaling million 
the company also executed a million senior subordinated note in favor of gecc 
the revolving credit facility  the term loans and the senior subordinated note provided a total of million of available financing 
the credit agreement is secured by a pledge of all of the assets of the subsidiaries of the company and all of the shares of capital stock of such subsidiaries 
interest on the revolving credit facility and term loans is initially charged at floating rates of basis points over the lender s prime rate or basis points over libor  at the option of the company 
the senior subordinated note of million bears interest at a floating rate of basis points over the lender s prime rate  but in no event less than 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information in regards to the credit agreement 
if the seymour acquisition had occurred on january   the company s net sales of million would have been increased by million to million and operating profits of million would have been increased by million to million 
the pro forma operating profit of million includes a charge of million related to management s plans to consolidate and dispose of certain manufacturing operations 
capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were 
million as compared to million at december  the decrease in cash is the result of daily sweeps against the company s revolving line of credit that was established in february  in connection with the tamor acquisition 
capital spending of million was used to acquire molds to support new product introductions  additional injection molding machines and to fund an expansion of the company s missouri warehouse facility 
since the tamor acquisition  working capital has increased million 
in july   the company completed a secondary stock offering of million shares of common stock 
net proceeds of million were used to repay a subordinated note of million  term notes of million and accrued interest of 
million 
the required borrowings for the seymour acquisition have significantly changed the company s financial structure 
to fund the acquisition  increased financing facilities were provided by commercial lenders to replace and augment the financing facilities in place at december  the new financing facilities consist of million of term loans and a million revolving line of credit under the credit agreement and a million senior subordinated note 
at march   the company had total short and long term debt outstanding of million and unused availability under the revolving line of credit of million 
during  million of debt will come due 
the company s capital spending needs in are expected to be between and million 
most of the spending relates to new injection molding presses to expand existing capacity and to replace old  inefficient machines 
the replacement machines are expected to reduce manufacturing cycle times and ongoing maintenance costs 
in addition  the company exercised an option to purchase the leased manufacturing and warehouse facility in missouri at an approximate cost of million 
where possible  management will pursue alternative means of financing such as capital leases and purchase money transactions 
in addition  operating leases will be pursued to the extent it represents an attractive economic alternative 
the company believes its existing financing facilities together with its cash flow from operations will provide sufficient capital to fund operations  make the required debt repayments and meet the anticipated capital spending needs 
management intends to continue to pursue its consolidation strategy within the housewares industry 
the current financing facilities are not intended to fund future acquisitions 
the ability to successfully fund future acquisitions will depend on the financial situation of the target company  possible renegotiation of existing credit terms or the possibility of obtaining an alternative credit facility  and the ability to use company stock in lieu of cash 
alternative financing arrangements are currently being explored including the possibility of a public debt offering  and the creation of a working capital and acquisition line of credit 
however  no commitments have been made as of march  outlook s operating and financial results exceeded management s expectations at the time of the january  tamor acquisition 
several planned strategic initiatives were successfully completed integration of the tamor business into hpi utilization of excess manufacturing capacity to improve gross profit margins continued improved profitability of the selfix business follow on stock offering of million shares  which raised over million to pay down debt  increased institutional ownership and expanded analyst coverage of the company increased share price and shareholder value with share price rising announcement at year end of the completion of the seymour acquisition management expects to be an equally fulfilling year for its shareholders 
on a pro forma basis  sales were up to while increased sales and market presence is vitally important  growth must also be profitable 
not all of the sales growth was sufficiently profitable 
in addition  the company was using its productive capacity at nearly 
as a result  the company faces the challenge in of putting manufacturing capacity to its most profitable use 
certain products will continue to be outsourced but only when product profitability targets are met 
to this end  management anticipates slower sales growth in while new product sales replace products expected to be discontinued 
this will allow the company to better use its manufacturing capacity to produce those products that provide the highest returns 
during  the company will evaluate its production capacity needs and identify ways by which to add capacity 
management continues to believe that significant sales growth opportunities exist in the storage container category 
it is management s intention to have the capacity in place by to allow for aggressive pursuit of profitable sales growth in this category 
the seymour acquisition will add significantly to sales 
if the seymour acquisition had occurred on january   the company s sales would have increased by million 
further  it is management s intention to fully integrate seymour s operating functions such as sales  marketing and finance into the existing operating departments of other hpi businesses 
this will allow for a reduction of pro forma operating expenses and improved profitability 
the seymour product line is more seasonal than the company s other products 
sales of seymour products are concentrated in the second and third quarter 
this corresponds to the spring summer wedding season and the back to school season 
as a result  sales and earnings are expected to be significantly higher in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters 
because the seymour products are composed primarily of steel and fabric  they provide a diversification hedge against the company s exposure to fluctuations in the cost of plastic resin 
in  management expects the cost of plastic resin to represent about of net sales as compared to in the company currently expects resin prices to increase slightly in as a result of changes in product mix  the composition of resins used and a tightening of resin supply 
as a result of the seymour acquisition  the company is highly leveraged and as such will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
further  the company will be subject to tight borrowing limits and mandatory repayments 
management expects  however  that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund needed capital improvements and new product development 
offsetting some of the interest rate risk is a reduction in interest rate margins as defined in the credit agreement 
the company s financial performance allowed for a lessening of such margins by about basis points 
management will continue to seek strategic acquisitions of companies and product lines that fit within the desired categories of products for the home 
management expects continued sales and earnings growth from future acquisitions but that additional financing may be necessary to support acquisition activity
