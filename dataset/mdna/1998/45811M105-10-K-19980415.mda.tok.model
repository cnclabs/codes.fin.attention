as of december   the outpatient behavioral health practice business accounted for approximately eighty four percent of the assets of the company before the impact of the write down of assets held for sale and the impact of the restructuring charge see below  and for the year ended december  approximately eighty three percent of the company s net revenues 
after the closing date  the company will no longer operate outpatient behavioral health practices and its primary business activity will be managed behavioral healthcare through its integra division 
as a result of the sale  the company will be a significantly smaller company in terms of revenues and assets 
the company s board of directors believes the terms of the sale are fair to  and in the best interest of the company and its shareholders 
in making its recommendation  the company considered the condition  prospects and strategic direction of the company s outpatient business 
the company also considered the current constraints on its ability to finance future growth and the positive effect the sale of assets and the repayment of debt would have on the company s ability to obtain additional financing

under the management services agreements  the company establishes annual operating and capital budgets for the professional corporations and compensation guidelines for the clinical professionals 
the management services agreements generally have initial terms of ten years or greater 
the method of computing the management fees varies by contract 
management fees are based on either i billings of the affiliated practice less the amounts necessary to pay professional compensation and other professional expenses or ii a license fee per location  reimbursement of direct costs  reimbursement of marketing costs plus a markup  and a flat administrative fee or iii a percentage of gross receipts of the affiliated practice 
in all cases  these fees are meant to compensate the company for expenses incurred in providing covered services plus a profit 
these interests are unilaterally saleable and transferable by the company and fluctuate based upon the actual performance of the operations of the professional corporations 
through the nominee arrangements  the company has a significant long term financial interest in the affiliated practices and  therefore  according to emerging issues task force no 
application of fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  and apb opinion no 
 business combinations  to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangement  the company must consolidate the results of the affiliated practices with those of the company

all significant intercompany accounts and transactions  including management fees  have been eliminated
