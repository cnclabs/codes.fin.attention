the accompanying financial statements include the operating results of carson products company carson products from the acquisition date 
the company s acquisition of the predecessor for approximately million in cash including million for fees and other costs directly associated with the acquisition was initially financed with long term borrowings aggregating approximately million and has been accounted for as a purchase the aminco acquisition 
accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the predecessor s identifiable assets and liabilities based on the fair values at the acquisition date 
liabilities assumed aggregated approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the predecessor s identifiable net assets has been classified as goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition  the senior management of the predecessor was replaced 
the predecessor had a march fiscal year end 
effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december the decision to change the fiscal year end was made in order to conform the company s financial reporting year to the natural business year of the industry 
on july   the company s south african subsidiary  carson holdings  l t d 
carson south africa sold of its shares in an initial public offering on the johannesburg stock exchange 
this offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
at the same time  carson south africa issued of its shares to certain employ e e s  officers and directors involved in the company s south african operations 
as a result of the issuance of these shares  the company has reflected in its consolidated statement of operations for periods subsequent to the share issuance a minority interest in subsidiary earnings 
the amount of the charge reflected in this line item equals carson south africa s net income for the applicable period multiplied by the percentage of the carson south africa shares which are not indirectly owned by the company 
in conjunction with the south african initial public offering  the company s us subsidiary  carson products entered into an amendment to its license agreement with carson products proprietary limited carson products sa  a south african registered company wholly owned by carson south africa  which provides that commencing on april   carson products sa will pay to carson products a royalty in the amount of of the net sales of all licensed products

the company does not view the exposure to rand exchange rate fluctuations as significant because the south african subsidiary incurs all of its costs in rand 
however  due to fluctuations in the exchange rate  there is a potential for losses on the consolidated level 
assets and liabilities of the company s south african operations are translated for consolidation purposes from south african rand into united states dollars at the rate of currency exchange at the end of the fiscal period 
revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly prevailing exchange rates 
resulting translation differences are recognized as a component of stockholders equity 
on june   carson made an investment of million in morningside am acquisition corp  the parent of am cosmetics  inc am cosmetics a leading low cost manufacturer of cosmetics 
the investment was made through the purchase of million of cumulative  payment in kind preferred stock 
the company s consolidated statements of operations for periods subsequent to june  include the dividend income from this investment  although dividends are anticipated to be paid through the issuance of additional preferred stock 
therefore  it is anticipated that no cash will be generated from this investment in the near future 
in connection with the investment  carson entered into a management agreement and will enter into certain related sales agreements and manufacturing agreements with am cosmetics 
the company completed the offering the initial public offering of  shares of class a common stock on the new york stock exchange on october  at a price of per share 
of these shares   were sold by the company with the balance sold by selling stockholders  none of which included any members of management or the original buy out group 
in the first half of  carson s south african subsidiary consummated three acquisitions in the african personal care industry i n cluding the african nu me cosmetics  restore plus and seasilk brand names and certain related assets 
the total purchase price  including fees  for these three acquisitions was approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments  comprised of million in cash and  shares of carson south africa common stock which resulted in a gain to the company of approximately  which was recorded in paid in capital in the year ended december

approximately million of the purchase price was paid in january  approximately million is payable on or before january  and the remainder subject to adjustment is payable no later than march effect of the recent acquisitions on results of operations the consummation of recent acquisitions affected the company s results of operations in certain significant respects 
the cutex acquisition and the other recent acquisitions have been reflected using purchase accounting  with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets being classified as goodwill 
therefore  depreciation and amortization expense increased for periods following each such acquisition  and interest expense also increased following the cutex acquisition due to increased debt used to finance the cutex acquisition 
similarly  the aminco acquisition was reflected using purchase accounting with the purchase price being allocated to the company s identifiable assets and liabilities based on fair values at the date of acquisition  which was august  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the company s identifiable net assets has been classified as goodwill 
the depreciation and amortization expense of the company are significantly higher than the corresponding amounts for the predecessor 
additionally  interest expense increased due to debt used to finance the aminco acquisition 
due to these increased expenses  the financial statements of the predecessor are not strictly comparable to those of the company for subsequent periods 
however  the following table combines historical fiscal data for the predecessor and the company in order to facilitate discussion of financial results 
statement of operations data company combined b twelve month twelve month nine month nine month period ended period ended period ended period ended dollars in s december  december  a december  december  unaudited unaudited net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     marketing and selling expenses     general and administrative expenses     incentive compensation   operating income     data as a percentage of sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit marketing and selling expenses general and administrative expenses incentive compensation operating income a the unaudited statement of operations for the twelve month period ended december  includes the audited results for the nine month period ended december  and the unaudited results for the three month period ended march  b the combined unaudited statement of operations for the nine month period ended december  includes results of predecessor operations for the period from april  to august  combined with company results of operations for the period from august  to december  the combined presentation is not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles but is included for comparative purposes only 
company twelve month period ended december  compared to twelve month period ended december  net sales 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of over the million reported for this sales increase is principally attributable to incremental sales of the domestic acquisitions of the cutex and let s jam brands in addition to strong growth in sales of the south african subsidiary  which saw sales increase by 
cutex  which was acquired on april   contributed million to consolidated sales  and let s jam  which was acquired on april  contributed million to sales

however  during this period  the company s overall market share of this category  as published by information resources  inc iri based on sales data from store register scanners at a sampling of food and drug store chains and mass merchandisers  increased slightly 
these market share results outperformed the ethnic hair care products market where sales at retail declined by approximately as published by iri 
the company believes that the softness in this market is attributable in part to continuing drug chain consolidation as well as consolidation in the distribution channel 
during the second half of  the company introduced a new line of cosmetics under the dark lovely brand name 
due to delays in the execution of the launch  net sales of dark lovely cosmetics were limited to million for gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
gross profit margin decreased from in to in management believes that this contraction in gross margin is principally attributable to inefficiencies in its manufacturing processes which resulted without a comparable increase in production volume 
the company is addressing these issues and by year end had added a senior vice president  operations and a director of materials management 
management believes that it has made significant progress in resolving the issues that adversely impacted gross margin in during  the company changed its method of valuing inventories in the united states from the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market to the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
the effect of this change has been reflected to the extent material in all periods presented in these financial statements

a total of million was incurred in the color cosmetics development and million was incurred in the development of the salon professional line 
these amounts were expensed as part of marketing and selling expenses during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
this increase is due in part to increased amortization related to recent acquisitions combined with increased professional fees and personnel costs associated with the enhancement of infrastructure needed to support the company s growth 
an example of the infrastructure improvements include costs to enhance the company s information services technology needed to meet financial reporting requirements as well as customer service demands 
the increases in personnel costs were attributable in large measure to the addition of a chief financial officer  a senior vice president  operations and a senior vice president  finance 
in addition  two incumbent executives who terminated their services at the end of were included in the cost structure throughout nonrecurring severance benefits aggregating  were paid or accrued and expensed in for these individuals 
incentive compensation

interest expense amounted to million in compared to million in although total interest expense did not increase materially from year to year  the company refinanced its debt in november by issuing million of senior subordinated notes 
accordingly  interest expense in future years  including amortization of debt issuance costs  can be expected to amount to a minimum of million per year
