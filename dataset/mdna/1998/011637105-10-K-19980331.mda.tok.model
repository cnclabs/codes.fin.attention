item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of alaris medical and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview alaris medical is a holding company for alaris medical systems 
alaris medical also identifies and evaluates potential acquisitions and investments  and performs various corporate functions 
as a holding company  alaris medical currently has no revenues to fund its operating and interest expense and relies on its existing cash  cash generated from operations of alaris medical systems and external borrowings to meet its obligations 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the merger on november   the operating results reported for the year ended december  are not comparable to or the operating results and cash flows represent those of advanced medical and imed 
the operating results and cash flows include those of ivac from november  through december  the company sells and services infusion systems primarily in the united states  western europe  canada  australia  latin america and the middle east 
the company generates revenues from the sale and or lease of infusion pumps and sales of associated proprietary disposable administration sets 
additionally  as a result of the merger  the company now generates revenue from the sale of patient monitoring products 
in recent years  the company s results of operations have been affected by the cost containment pressures applicable to health care providers 
in particular  in order to reduce costs  certain hospitals have adopted a protocol increasing the maximum time between disposable administration set changes from every hours to as much as every hours 
notwithstanding this change in protocol  unit sales volume of the company s disposable administration sets increased in every year since  primarily as a result of the growth in its installed base of infusion pumps 
however  uncertainty remains with regard to future changes within the healthcare industry 
the trend towards managed care and economically motivated buyers in the us may result in continued pressure on selling prices of products and compression on gross margins 
the us marketplace is increasingly characterized by consolidation among healthcare providers and purchasers of medical products 
the company s profitability is affected by the increasing use of group purchasing organizations gpos which are better able to negotiate favorable pricing from providers of infusion systems  such as the company  and which police compliance with exclusive buying arrangements for their members 
these buying arrangements  in certain situations  also may result in the gpo requiring removal of the company s existing infusion pumps 
the company expects that such gpos will become increasingly more common and may have an adverse effect on the company s future profitability 
finally  the enactment of national health care reform or other legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery would affect the company s future results of operations 
although the final form of any such legislation is not known  it is likely that any such legislation may impose limits on the number and type of medical procedures which may be performed and may restrict a provider s ability to select specific devices or products for use in administering care which  in turn  could adversely impact demand and or pricing for the company s infusion systems 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which the company may be affected by any such change in legislation

the pro forma data is based on the historical operating results of advanced medical and ivac holdings  inc  adjusted to give effect to the merger as if it occurred on january  the data excludes non recurring charges related to the merger  as well as the operating results of river medical  inc  a subsidiary of ivac which was divested prior to the consummation of the merger

in particular  alaris medical systems credit facility permits alaris medical systems to transfer to alaris medical up to million annually to fund alaris medical s operating expenses and additional amounts sufficient to meet interest expense requirements 
the company expects to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including capital expenditure requirements with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
in addition to operating expenses  the company s primary future use of funds will be to fund capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions and to pay debt service on outstanding indebtedness 
during  the company made cash payments of approximately million related to merger and integration costs accrued at december   as well as payments of approximately million for integration costs expensed during at december   the company s outstanding indebtedness was million  which includes million of bank term debt under the credit facility and million of senior subordinated notes due the notes  which were issued in connection with the merger 
the bank debt bears interest at floating rates based  at the company s option  on eurodollar or prime rates 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement covering of its term loan borrowings 
such agreement fixed the interest rate charged on such borrowings resulting in a weighted average fixed rate of on the principal balance covered 
as a result  a one percent increase in the rate of interest charged on indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility at december  would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately million 
during march  the credit facility was amended and the interest rates on the bank debt reduced 
as a result  the weighted average interest rate  including the effect of the interest rate protection agreement  was reduced to based on the amounts outstanding at the time of the amendment 
the company incurred fees of approximately 
million related to such interest rate reductions 
included in total consolidated debt  at december   alaris medical had outstanding million of convertible debentures

the company s remaining obligation to sis is the greater of million per year or of the prior year s ms iii sales in and the company made the minimum payment of million during the first quarter of as a result of the company s significant indebtedness  the company expects to incur significant interest expense in future periods 
the company believes that cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet its interest expense obligations 
annual amortization of the company s indebtedness is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the convertible debentures provide for semi annual interest payments of approximately million and mature on january  the notes and the credit facility permit alaris medical systems to fund interest payments on the convertible debentures and to make limited distributions to alaris medical to fund operating expenses and to pay income taxes  provided that  with respect to the credit facility  there exists no default or event of default under the credit facility 
the notes and the credit facility  however  restrict distributions to alaris medical to fund the repayment of the convertible debentures at maturity 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million during the year ended december   of which approximately million was related to the consolidation of the imed and ivac facilities 
the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million during in addition to routine capital expenditures  the company has made a total of approximately million of capital and operating expenditures during and expects to make approximately million and 
million during and  respectively  for the acquisition and implementation of a new enterprise wide information system 
during the first quarter of the company created a corporate development function to assess product and company acquisitions  distribution alliances and joint ventures which would expand company technologies into unserved markets 
while there can be no assurances that the company will complete any acquisitions  depending on the value of potential acquisitions  the company might fund such transactions through a variety of sources  including existing or new debt facilities or through the sale of equity securities 
the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its operations  make planned capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest under its credit facility and interest on the notes  however  the company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity 
accordingly  the company may have to refinance the notes at or prior to maturity or sell assets or raise equity capital to repay the principal amount of the notes 
in addition  the company s ability to fund its operations  to make planned capital expenditures and to make scheduled principal and interest payments will be dependent on the company s future operating performance  which is itself dependent on a number of factors  many of which the company cannot control  including conditions affecting the company s foreign operations  prevailing economic conditions  availability of other sources of liquidity  and financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the company s business and operations 
seasonality infusion instrument sales are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales compensation plans which reward the achievement of annual quotas and the seasonal characteristics of the industry  including hospital purchasing patterns 
first quarter sales are traditionally not as strong as the fourth quarter 
the company anticipates that this trend will continue but is unable to predict the effect  if any  from health care reform and increased competitive pressures 
backlog the backlog of orders  believed to be firm  at december  and was million and million  respectively 
foreign operations as a result of the merger  the company has significant foreign operations 
accordingly  the company is subject to various risks  including without limitation  foreign currency risks 
historically  the company has not entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge such exposure and such risk 
due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during  primarily a strengthening of the us dollar against many european currencies  the company recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately million during the company will evaluate hedging programs during to limit the exposure to the company resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
health care reform heightened public awareness and concerns regarding the growth in overall health care expenditures in the united states may result in the enactment of legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery 
legislation which imposes limits on the number and type of medical procedures which may be performed or which has the effect of restricting a provider s ability to select specific devices or products for use in administrating medical care may adversely impact the demand for the company s products 
in addition  legislation which imposes restrictions on the price which may be charged for medical products may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which the company or the health care industry in general may be adversely affected by the aforementioned in the future
