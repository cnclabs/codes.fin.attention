at maturity or when market conditions warrant  the company will either sell or re lease the assets 
operating leases and direct finance leases in aircraft and related equipment will continue to be actively managed to maximize their value  which may be facilitated by the sales or other types of liquidations of the assets

however  no assurance can be given that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts to execute this plan 
year computer issue many computer systems currently in use were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to identify the year 
as a result  such computer systems will recognize the year as 
this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
echelon has several projects underway to address the year issue
