the assets acquired include interests in proved oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  louisiana  and east texas  as well as exploratory properties in leasehold acreage in those areas and in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico 
in addition to its oil and gas development and producing activities  the company markets natural gas and operates natural gas gathering and transportation systems in louisiana 
hedging activities 
the company periodically uses forward sales contracts  natural gas price swap agreements  natural gas basis swap agreements and options to reduce exposure to downward price fluctuations on its natural gas production 
the company does not engage in speculative transactions 
during  the company used price and basis swap agreements 
price swap agreements generally provide for the company to receive or make counterparty payments on the differential between a fixed price and a variable indexed price for natural gas 
basis swap agreements generally provide for the company to receive or make counterparty payments on the differential between a variable indexed price and the price it receives from the sale of natural gas production  and are used to hedge against unfavorable price movements in the relationship between such variable indexed price and the price received for such production 
gains and losses realized by the company from hedging activities are included in oil and gas revenues and average sales prices in the period that the related production is sold 
the company s hedging activities also cover the oil and gas production attributable to the interest in such production of the public unitholders in its subsidiary partnerships 
through natural gas price swap agreements  approximately of the company s natural gas production for was affected by its hedging transactions at an average nymex quoted price of per mmbtu before transaction and transportation costs 
as of december   approximately of the company s anticipated natural gas production for has been hedged by natural gas price swap agreements at an average nymex quoted price of per mmbtu before transaction and transportation costs 
certain natural gas price swap agreements outstanding at december  permit the counterparty to double the contract volume at a specified price 
if this feature is exercised on all contracts outstanding at december   approximately of the company s anticipated natural gas production for has been hedged by natural gas price swap agreements at an average nymex quoted price of per mmbtu before transaction and transportation costs

at december   the unrealized gain on the company s existing hedging instruments for future production months in approximated million 
the credit risk exposure from counterparty nonperformance on natural gas forward sales contracts and derivative financial instruments is generally the amount of unrealized gains under the contracts 
the company has not experienced counterparty nonperformance on these agreements and does not anticipate any in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s oil and gas revenues of million for increased compared to million in primarily as a result of an increase in gas production  partially offset by lower oil prices and gas prices 
the increase in gas production is primarily due to the company s drilling activities in north louisiana and the addition of one month of production from the spr properties partially offset by the sale of one half of its interest in wells and related facilities in the houma embayment in terrebonne parish  louisiana in the fourth quarter of interest and other income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to higher interest income resulting from invested funds received from the sale of common stock in february and gains on the sale of assets recognized in production expenses for increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily reflecting higher overall production levels 
on a unit basis  lifting costs production expenses less ad valorem and severance taxes decreased to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe last year  primarily reflecting lower average costs on north louisiana production  which is increasing in proportion to other higher cost production 
exploration expenses remained constant from to at million 
increased dry hole expenses were offset by a reduction in lease rental expense reflecting the joint exploration agreement effective december in south louisiana with williams 
general and administrative expenses of million in decreased compared to million last year  reflecting efficiencies obtained in the realignment of the workforce

the reasons for the earnings improvement are described in the foregoing discussion 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s oil and natural gas revenues of million for increased compared to million for as a result of increased natural gas prices and a increase in natural gas production to mmcf in the average price of natural gas increased to per mcf in from per mcf in the company s production of natural gas steadily declined during the second and third quarters of as a result of poor drilling results in south louisiana 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s prior management implemented a significant reduction in drilling activity  which adversely affected production in the first half of the company s current accelerated drilling program increased production substantially in the second half of production of crude oil and natural gas liquids during totaled  barrels with an average sales price of per barrel compared to  barrels at per barrel in  representing a volume decrease of and a price increase of 
the decline in oil and condensate volumes was due to the decline in south louisiana gas production 
production expenses for decreased to million from million in on a unit basis  production expenses decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in  reflecting lower average costs on production from north louisiana  which increased in proportion to other higher cost production from south louisiana 
exploration expenses totaled million in and million in  a decrease of  primarily as a result of a temporary suspension of exploratory drilling pending negotiation of a joint exploration agreement in south louisiana 
the decrease in this activity also reflected lower geological and geophysical expenses and unproved leasehold impairment costs

liquidity and capital resources general 
the company s liquidity is materially affected by cash flows generated from its oil and gas production and was adversely affected in years prior to by unsuccessful drilling results on high risk prospects in south louisiana 
in addition  high interest expense and restrictions under the company s debt instruments after the consolidation limited the company s ability to fund drilling projects 
these restrictions required the company to suspend preferred stock dividends and seek a substantial equity infusion in early to avoid a financial covenant default under the credit agreement in effect at that time 
this effort resulted in the contour transaction  completed in february the contour transaction allowed the company to retire its outstanding bank debt  secure a new banking facility and improve its working capital position 
although the contour transaction and the debt refinancings have provided the company with the means to continue its drilling operations with the objective of increasing its cash flow and reserves  the company had million face amount of debt outstanding as of december   requiring million in annual cash interest payments 
although dividends are restricted under the company s existing credit facility and are restricted under the indenture for the senior subordinated notes the indenture  the outstanding preferred stock is cumulative  requires dividends to accumulate currently at the rate of million annually and carries liquidation preferences over the common stock totaling million at december   including such dividend arrearages 
on april   the board of directors of the company declared a dividend of per preferred share approximately million  which was paid on may  the company has not declared the quarterly dividends of for february   may   august   november  and february  aggregating approximately million

net cash provided by operating activities  before working capital adjustments  during aggregated million 
funds used in investing activities were comprised of capital expenditures of million and acquisition expenditures for the spr properties of million 
funds provided by financing activities were comprised primarily of net principal borrowings of million on the bank credit facility and million from the sale of common stock  partially offset by the payment of million of preferred stock dividends 
as a result of these activities  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million as of december  as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million  compared to a working capital deficit of million at the end of the balance of the working capital deficit will be funded through operations and or bank borrowings 
the following table sets forth on an unaudited basis net cash provided by operating activities before working capital adjustments  net cash used in investing activities and ebitdax 
in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities before working capital adjustments    net cash used in investing activities    ebitdax    ebitdax is calculated as net income loss before extraordinary items  excluding interest expense and other debt expenses  income taxes  exploration costs  restructuring expense  depletion  depreciation  amortization  and impairment of oil and gas properties 
ebitdax is not a measure of cash flow as determined by gaap 
the company has included information concerning ebitdax because ebitdax is a measure used by certain investors in determining a company s historical ability to service its indebtedness 
ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s operating performance or liquidity 
ebitdax is not necessarily comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company 
capital resources 
the credit facility provides for a maximum million revolving credit loan and matures  with all amounts owed thereunder becoming due and payable  effective december  borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base to be determined semi annually by the lenders based in part on the proved oil and gas reserves and other assets of the company which may be redetermined more frequently at the election of the lenders or the borrowers 
the borrowing base at december  was million  including an overadvance of million 
at the time of the next borrowing base determination  which is expected to be no earlier than may   this overadvance is scheduled to be excluded from the borrowing base effective june  at december   million of borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
capital commitments 
the company s capital expenditure budget provides for million to be expended on development drilling primarily in north louisiana and million to be expended on exploratory prospects primarily in south louisiana  the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  texas and new mexico 
during  the company participated in drilling gross net wells  of which gross net wells were completed 
the drilling performance reflects lower risk operations in north louisiana and exploratory successes in south louisiana 
the company  with its partners  continues exploration activities in south louisiana 
as of the end of the year  the company was participating in the drilling or completing of gross net wells  of which gross net wells were subsequently completed as producing wells 
effective as of december   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of spr for approximately million 
the purchase price of spr was funded in part through a million equity contribution from contour production company llp contour 
this equity contribution was made pursuant to the voluntary exercise of its february option agreement contour option to purchase million shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the balance of the funding was provided through bank financing 
in addition  the company has an active program for ongoing evaluation of opportunities meeting its acquisition criteria 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition candidates will be available to the company on terms it deems reasonable or that any completed acquisition will ultimately prove to be a successful undertaking by the company 
the company has planned in to fund its debt service obligations  capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs through cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the company s plans are predicated on cash flow assumptions utilizing commodity prices in the range realized in material increases or decreases in natural gas prices  which are highly volatile  will impact the company s cash flows and its ability to carry out its capital program 
the company may be required to pursue additional financing alternatives to fully realize its objectives for property development and acquisitions 
the company does not anticipate that it will incur any significant expenditures to address year issues  nor do year issues represent a known material event or uncertainty to the company 
to the extent that the company may be adversely affected by the year issues of its suppliers  customers and other entities  the company does not believe that it will be more adversely affected than other companies in its industry with similar operations 
inflation and changing prices 
oil and natural gas prices  as with most commodities  are highly volatile  have fluctuated during recent years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation 
the following table shows the changes in the average oil and gas prices received by the company during the periods indicated
