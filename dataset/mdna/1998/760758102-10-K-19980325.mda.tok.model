interest rate risk management the operations of the bank are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
management of interest rate sensitivity involves matching the maturity and repricing dates of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities in an effort to manage the impact of fluctuating interest rates on net interest margins 
the asset liability committee alco has the responsibility for the management of interest rate risk 
operating within risk tolerance levels approved by the board of directors  alco meets at least quarterly to establish  communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management procedures 
the purpose of alco is to monitor the volume and mix of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities consistent with the company s overall liquidity  capital  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the bank utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the percentage of financial assets and liabilities in the company s existing portfolio that are subject to repricing within specific time periods 
in addition  the bank measures interest rate sensitivity of its budgeted growth in financial assets and liabilities 
these differences  known as interest sensitivity gaps  are usually calculated cumulatively for blocks of time 
the model quantifies the potential changes in future earnings which is measured by the effects of various interest rate changes in net income over the ensuing one and two year periods 
the company manages its interest rate risk exposure by limiting the amount of long term fixed rate loans it holds for investment  increasing emphasis on shorter term loans for portfolio  increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of long term and short term borrowings and deposits and or purchasing commitments to sell loans 
the following table presents the company s exposure to interest rate risk at december  december  one year to to over or less years years years total dollars in thousands total interest earning assets      total interest bearing liabilities     interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets in preparing the table above  certain assumptions have been made with regard to loan prepayments and withdrawals of now  money market and savings account deposits 
loan prepayment rates are based upon market consensus estimates for similar securities 
now  money market and savings account balances are assumed to reprice immediately and are included in one year or less 
all other assets and liabilities have been repriced based on the earlier of repricing or contractual maturity 
the above assumptions are annual percentages based on the latest available assumptions and on remaining balances and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by the company 
moreover  certain shortcomings are inherent in the analysis presented by the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods for repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of or lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition to the above  the bank is committed to fund million in new loans and million in construction loans in process at december  these loans and commitments are largely protected from interest rate fluctuations because they are either adjustable rate loans or are fixed rate loans which the bank has obtained commitments to sell in the secondary market 
this relationship is not linear or consistent with other interest rate assets and liabilities on the company s balance sheet and management uses computer modeling in its efforts to reduce the effects that interest rate fluctuations have on income 
the current potential changes in future earnings relating to financial assets and liabilities as of december  are as follows potential change in future earnings interest rate change in basis points the most significant assumptions used in this simulation relate primarily to the repricing rates of demand and other nonmaturity deposits and loan prepayment rates 
demand and nonmaturity deposits are assumed to reprice immediately 
loan prepayment rates are based upon market consensus estimates for similar securities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the simulation presented by the above table 
for example  certain financial assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods for repricing  that may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the potential changes in future earnings shown above are within the bank s interest rate risk policy limits 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial information presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or same magnitude as the price of goods and services

year matters the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or computer programs of the company s third party vendors that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
the company has identified and initiated formal communications with all of its significant vendors to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issue 
at this time  the company has indications that it s two critical systems serviced by outside vendors will be year compliant by the end of however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company has also initiated formal communications with all its significant loan customers to assess the impact of the year issue on the borrowers ability to repay and to determine the borrowers ability and readiness to become year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software and third party vendor programs for year compliance 
the company anticipates completing the year project within one year but not later than october   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the cost of the year project will be funded through operating cash flows 
while management does not anticipate the cost of the year project to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  operations or cash flows  the project is currently substantially incomplete in the areas of testing the computer systems and assessing the impact of the year issue on borrowers 
the anticipated costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year project is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
