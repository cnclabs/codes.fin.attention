the company s primary concentration was in the internetworking market until when it split the operating divisions of the company into three business units  each with its own management structure 
these three units focused on internetworking  network management software developed from its roots in osi technology and wireless applications software 
in  the company merged the wireless applications software subsidiary into its network management software subsidiary  vertel 
additionally  in  the company s internetworking hardware subsidiary  sonoma systems inc sonoma  announced it would focus solely on broadband access equipment for the telecommunications marketplace 
in december  it was announced that the company would discontinue investment in sonoma and seek outside investors 
such financing was arranged in early and the results of operations have been reclassified to present the operating results of sonoma as a discontinued operation see note to financial statements

the company released its first tmn software products and services in by  the company no longer sold new licenses to its osi software products  but still receives a limited amount of related royalty and support revenue 
as a result of the product line transition in the company s business  the company s results of operations prior to should not be relied upon as indicative of future results 
the company is a leader in developing  marketing and supporting vertically integrated  object oriented software solutions for the management of public telecommunications networks

the company offers embedded software for network equipment  software that allows telecommunications service providers to integrate proprietary or snmp based network management systems with a tmn standards based solution and object oriented software platforms that facilitate the rapid development of network and service management applications and features such as fault detection and automatic response  remote improvement of network configuration  automation of accounting and billing functions  optimization of network traffic and security 
the company provides professional services to implement and maintain a complete tmn based solution efficiently  including system engineering  custom application development and technical support 
the company sells its products and services primarily through a direct sales force in the united states and abroad and  in certain territories  utilizes commissioned third party agents

the company s customers include telecommunications service providers and their customers  network equipment manufacturers  independent software developers and software platform vendors 
the company derives revenue primarily from software source license fees  royalties and services  including professional services  technical support and maintenance 
source license fees consist primarily of licenses of the company s tmn software products and development platforms 
source license revenue is recognized upon transfer of the source code to the customer  provided there are no significant remaining obligations and collectability is deemed probable by management in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
to date  substantially all source license fees have been recognized upon transfer 
source license fees typically have accounted for a substantial portion of total revenue in each quarter 
source license agreements generally do not provide for a right of return 
reserves are maintained for returns and potential credit losses  neither of which has had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition through december  pursuant to source code license agreements  licensees may distribute binary or embedded versions of the company s software in the licensees products 
royalties become due upon shipment of products containing the binary or embedded code and generally are recognized upon notification by the licensee to vertel that products have been shipped 
because of the development times required for licensees to design and ship products containing binary or embedded software  the company generally does not receive royalties from shipments of such products for at least three quarters from the date the company initially ships source code 
certain of the company s source license agreements provide for prepayment of royalties 
the company typically recognizes guaranteed minimum prepaid royalties  which are not subject to future obligations upon shipment of the underlying source code
