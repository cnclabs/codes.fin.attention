the settlement of the imbalances can occur either during  or at the end of  the life of a well on a volume basis or by cash settlement 
the company does not expect that a significant portion of the settlements will occur in any one year

samedan has from time to time settled various claims against parties which failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to samedan to purchase gas at fixed prices greater than market or pursuant to take or pay provisions 
the company s policy  which is consistent with general industry practice  is that amounts received in such settlements settlement payments do not represent payment for gas produced and  therefore  are not subject to royalty payments 
property owners  including governmental authorities and private parties  have in recent years asserted claims against samedan and other oil and gas companies for royalties on settlement payments 
samedan participated  in a joint effort with other energy companies and the independent petroleum association of america ipaa  in a test case which challenged the determination by the us minerals management service mms that royalties were payable to the government on certain settlement payments received by samedan and the other plaintiffs 
the district court for the district of columbia the dc district court entered a judgment against samedan in the amount of  in august  the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed the judgment against samedan 
in subsequent proceedings in the dc district court consistent with the appellate court decision  on july   the court enjoined the mms from taking action to collect from samedan royalties on non recoupable settlement payments the mms injunction 
the mms has until april  to appeal the mms injunction 
notwithstanding the ultimate outcome with respect to the mms injunction  samedan may be the subject of future legal actions by property owners claiming royalties on other settlement payments received by samedan 
there can be no assurance that samedan will prevail in any such action 
the company is unable to estimate the possible amount of loss  if any  associated with this contingency 
management believes that the company is well positioned with its balanced reserves of oil and gas to take advantage of future price increases that may occur 
however  the uncertainty of oil and gas prices continues to impact the domestic oil and gas industry 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices  the company  from time to time  has used hedging and may do so in the future as a means of controlling its exposure to price changes 
the company cannot predict the extent to which its operations will be impacted by inflation  government regulation or changing prices
