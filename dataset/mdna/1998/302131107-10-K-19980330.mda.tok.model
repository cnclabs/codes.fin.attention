there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience significant returns  which could be greater than the company s provision for returns or could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
in accordance with its policy  the company will continue to reassess market conditions and adjust its provision for returns as it deems appropriate 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to from 
this decrease was primarily due to the provisions of million and million recorded in and discussed under comparison of years ended december  and below  partially offset by higher costs associated with increased sales volume 
the company expects cost of revenues in future periods will increase modestly over those in the current year due to more product content provided with new and promotional items  and continued mix changes favoring boxed products  which have higher packaging and freight costs 
the company believes that retailers prefer such boxed products due to their additional marketing content and appeal 
cost of revenues consists primarily of product cost  freight charges  royalties to outside programmers and content providers  as well as amortization of software licenses and an inventory provision for damaged and obsolete products  if any 
product costs consist of the costs to purchase the underlying materials and print both boxes and manuals  media costs disks and cd roms and fulfillment assembly and shipping

cd rom products represented of net revenues in compared to in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of net revenues to from 
the increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to increased unit sales volume and the charges for excess and obsolete inventory during the second quarter 
in the second quarter of  the company s evaluation of the estimated inventory value for products returned from customers was changed and resulted in a million charge to cost of revenues 
the company s valuation reflects principally the impact of new product versions rendering older product versions obsolete or unsalable  the return of slow moving products  and existing excess quantities of inventory 
such slow moving products and products for which new versions have been released are difficult to sell through alternative channels 
in addition  the company experienced temporary difficulties in the implementation of new management information systems which contributed to purchasing higher levels of inventory than were necessary in the normal course of business 
when the sales objectives for the june quarter were not achieved  an evaluation of inventories was performed and a valuation adjustment of million was recorded  of which million related to swfte inventories acquired subsequent to the acquisition and million of expert brand inventories for which on hand quantities exceed expected future demand

the company anticipates that it will continue to incur risks for uncollectible accounts 
purchased research and development 
on november   the company acquired all of the capital stock of swfte 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  the purchase price was approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  and  unregistered shares of expert common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase 
the company expensed approximately million  or approximately  of the initial purchase price for swfte as purchased research and development during the quarter ending december  approximately million of the initial purchase price for swfte was recorded as intangible assets and is being amortized over two to two and one half years 
such purchase price allocation was determined based on an independent appraisal  and related amortization was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
development 
development expenses increased to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of net revenues to from 
development expenses include costs relating to product upgrades  new products development activities  quality control and expanded customer service support 
the increase was principally due to additional staffing  mostly as a result of the acquisition of swfte 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced development personnel and did not renew the lease for the facilities previously occupied by swfte 
loss on impairment of assets 
during the three months ended june   management reevaluated the carrying value of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the november acquisition of swfte 
these intangible assets consisted of acquired software technology  a license agreement to use the bicycle r brand name in certain card game software  the assembled workforce acquired  and swfte s customer list 
this reevaluation of the intangible assets was necessitated by management s determination based on then recent results of operations that the expected sales and cash flows from the acquired assets would be substantially lower than had been previously expected by management 
the acquired swfte products originally projected to generate the most significant sales and cash flows sold at substantially lower than expected rates in certain of those titles now face new competition from other publishers  which has taken market share away from those titles 
in particular  the card games category has become more competitive as a result of recent marketing efforts by sierra on line  and others 
additionally  certain other acquired titles were released shortly before the acquisition of swfte 
based on low sales rates  some retailers discontinued certain of these new titles and management determined their expected future sales to be minimal 
a significantly higher level of returns was experienced with the products acquired in the acquisition over the rate of returns experienced with the company s other products 
management believes that certain titles were sold into the distribution and retail channel prior to the acquisition at higher rates than could be supported by sales through to the end users 
this prompted distributors and retailers to return these products 
this overstock of product and returns experience  in management s judgment  damaged the brand and reduced their expected future sales levels 
lower than expected acceptance of the acquired products  together with the terminations resulting from closing the swfte facilities in delaware to consolidate all operations at the company s headquarters in florida  caused management to write off the value originally ascribed to the workforce in place 
value was originally ascribed to swfte s customer list based upon management s assessment of the value of swfte s experience in dealing with certain educational channels and bookstores 
due to the lower than expected sales rates and higher than expected returns rates for the acquired products  management no longer believes this to be true  and accordingly has written off the costs assigned to the customer list 
these factors were determined not to be short term or temporary in nature  causing management to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets by million 
management also determined that the lower demand for the acquired products and recent customer claims for pre acquisition cooperative marketing and price protection credits required an additional provision for reserves for returns of million higher than originally provided on the acquired accounts receivable  and a provision for reserves higher than originally provided on the acquired inventory 
such provisions were recorded during the three months ended june   and are included in the stated loss on impairment of intangibles 
additionally  the lower than expected sales and higher than expected returns levels on the acquired products indicated that the minimum royalties required under certain contracts and prepaid royalties would not be recouped in the ordinary course of business 
approximately million of such royalties were therefore accrued as part of the loss on impairment of intangibles as of june  similarly  losses on fixed assets and certain other assets determined to have lower values than originally assigned have been accrued as part of the loss on impairment of intangibles as of june  interest income expense 
net interest income decreased to  in from  in  due primarily to reduced balances of interest bearing assets 
tax provision benefit 
the benefit for income taxes increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased operating losses 
the benefit for income taxes in also reflects an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million  which reduced the benefit by million compared to the expected benefit computed at the statutory federal income tax rate

the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future sales and  as a result  operating results would be disproportionately affected by a reduction in sales or a failure to meet the company s sales expectations 
the consumer software business is seasonal 
typically  net revenues are the highest during the fourth calendar quarter and decline sequentially in the first and second calendar quarters 
the seasonal pattern is due primarily to the increased demand for consumer software during the year end holiday buying season

liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in working capital  including million in cash 
to date  the company has not invested in any financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december the company believes that cash generated by operations may be affected by an increase in working capital requirements as it continues to expand operations 
in response to such growth in working capital requirements  the company entered into a loan agreement with a bank which provides for a revolving line of credit collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings under the line are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables as defined in the agreement and may not exceed million through may   the maturity date 
the loan agreement contains restrictive covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will continue to be in compliance with the line of credit covenants which  among other things  prohibit two consecutive quarterly losses  or that the line of credit would be otherwise available to the company 
over the last year  the company has increased its stockholders equity  working capital and ratio of current assets to current liabilities  primarily as a result of profits realized during the period 
with these developments  management believes that it has adequate financial resources for its planned operations through longer term  management believes that its expense reduction efforts  together with anticipated revenue increases  should provide for positive cash flow to fund future operations 
the company s federal tax filings with respect to the year ended december  and subsequent years are presently being reviewed by the internal revenue service irs 
see item  legal proceedings  and note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements at item from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of products  businesses and technologies that would complement or expand the company s business

factors affecting future operating results in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is providing the following cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from its historical operating results and from those projected in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s future actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
general business and economic conditions general business and economic conditions have an impact on the company s financial results 
the company s customer base  which is largely retailers and distributors for resale to retailers  may be impacted by weak economic conditions and  as a result  may reduce required inventory levels of products purchased from the company 
the company s customers are not contractually required to make future purchases of the company s products and therefore could discontinue carrying the company s products in favor of a competitor s products or for any other reason 
the company s financial results could be affected by the size and rate of growth of the consumer software market and consumer pc market 
the consumer software business is seasonal due primarily to the increased demand for consumer software during the year end holiday buying season 
general business and economic conditions and consumer confidence may impact retail sales of consumer software 
currency fluctuations associated with international sales and accounts receivable may also affect the company s financial results 
competition the market for the company s products is intensely and increasingly competitive 
existing consumer software companies may broaden their product lines to compete with the company s products and potential new competitors  including computer hardware and software manufacturers  diversified media companies and book publishing companies  may enter or increase their focus on the consumer software market  resulting in even greater competition for the company 
there has been a consolidation among competitors in the market for the company s products  and many of the companies with which the company currently competes or may compete in the future have greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  as well as greater name recognition and better access to consumers  than the company 
the competition for retail space is also likely to increase due to the proliferation of consumer software products and companies 
dependence on retailers and distributors retailers and distributors compete in a volatile industry that is subject to rapid change  consolidation  financial difficulty and increasing competition from new distribution channels 
due to increased competition for limited shelf space  retailers and distributors are increasingly in a better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale  including price discounts  promotional support and product return policies 
the company s financial results may be impacted by the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand  the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  account cancellations or delays in shipment  competitors marketing strategies and promotions  changes in pricing strategies by the company or its competitors and the collectibility of accounts receivable 
furthermore  a significant portion of sales within a quarter is typically not realized until late in that quarter 
as a result  it may be difficult for the company to predict is net revenues for the quarter or to quickly adapt its spending levels within a quarter to reflect changes in demand for its products 
uncertainty of market acceptance  changes in technology and industry standards the consumer software industry is undergoing rapid changes  including evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions and changes in consumer requirements and preferences 
consumer preferences are difficult to predict  and few consumer products achieve sustained market acceptance 
the company s financial results will be impacted by market acceptance of the company s products and those of its competitors  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new products  new versions of existing products or new operating systems  evolving distribution channels  and the growth in popularity of the internet and other new technologies which could impact the distribution and purchase of software 
other factors in addition to the important factors discussed above  the company s financial results  financial position and cash flows may be impacted by  among other factors  future cash flow and working capital requirements  implementation and expansion of the company s systems and operations to accommodate the company s anticipated future revenues  the outcome of current and future examinations by taxing authorities  and the acquisitions of new businesses by the company and related charges and write offs 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and in the future will likely be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors  such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  or other events 
the year issue the company does not believe that it has material exposure to the year issue with respect to its own information system as the supplier of its primary systems has an updated release of the company s applications software that correctly identifies the year the company plans to implement the new release beginning in and to complete the implementation before the fourth quarter of however  there can be no assurance that this software implementation will be successfully completed  or that the implementation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results  financial position and cash flows 
the company is seeking to determine if the information systems of its major customers and vendors insofar as they relate to the company s business comply with year requirements  and there can be no assurance that the year issue will not affect the information systems of the company s major customers and vendors as they relate to the company s business  or that any such impact of a major customer s or vendor s information system would not have a material adverse effect on the company
