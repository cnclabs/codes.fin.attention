the company has not derived any revenue from product sales and  excluding the effect of one time license fees received in from schering plough and american home products and from schering plough and pfizer in  expects to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues 
revenues to date have come from three collaborative research agreements entered into with pfizer  one collaboration with schering plough  one license agreement with american home products and from interest income 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of the company s research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products

in addition  general and administrative expenses necessary to support the expanded research and development activities are expected to increase for the foreseeable future 
years ended december   and the company s fiscal operating revenues decreased percent to million from operating revenues of million  a percent decrease from fiscal operating revenues of million

license fees in were comprised of a similar million library access fee from schering plough together with a million fee from american home products received in connection with entering into the american home products agreement 
license fees in consisted of a million fee from schering plough received in connection with entering into the schering plough agreement and a million fee from pfizer received in connection with entering into the pfizer agreement 
research and development revenues of million for fiscal represented a million  or percent  increase over fiscal research and development revenues of million 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in reimbursements from pfizer of certain development costs in the npy obesity project  as described below 
research and development revenues for fiscal of million represented a million  or percent  increase over fiscal research and development revenues of million 
this increase was due to the commencement of research funding under the schering plough agreement in the third quarter of and under the pfizer agreement in the fourth quarter of research and development revenues in each of   and include scheduled research funding payments from pfizer and schering plough  under separate collaborations  to fund neurogen s collaborative research programs and  in the case of neurogen s npy obesity collaboration with pfizer  to reimburse neurogen under a cost sharing arrangement for certain expenses associated with human clinical trials conducted by neurogen 
the amount of such reimbursements have increased in each of the respective years  but may fluctuate significantly depending on the level of clinical trials being conducted

the company has conducted a review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations to existing software and converting to new software 
while the company cannot accurately predict any impact the year problem may have on third parties with whom the company conducts business  the company believes that the cost of making its information systems ready will not be material
