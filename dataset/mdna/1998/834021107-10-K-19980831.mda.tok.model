in fiscal the company acquired two cad cam technology companies  a cad cam and pdm services business and a structural dynamics research corporation sdrc reseller 
as a result  the company now has offices in states and offices in western europe along with indirect distribution relationships in asia 
most importantly  the company now possesses technology of its own  more than degreed mechanical engineers and a stable  recurring service business that can reduce the impact of fluctuations in the software order flow from quarter to quarter due to forces outside the company s control 
results of operations total revenue increased from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was primarily the result of the acquisitions of the two services businesses in the last half of fiscal that were included in fiscal results for the full year and the two technology companies acquired in fiscal the technologies the company now owns through these acquisitions have essentially become the primary technology offerings although reseller agreements with third party technology companies is expected to be of continued importance 
the dependence on the pmtc distribution agreement has been eliminated with these acquisitions 
total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase in revenue was primarily the result of the acquisitions of the services only businesses during fiscal offset by a decrease in revenue from hardware and software sales resulting from the transition to the mid range software offering as discussed in the form k filing in item business under the caption product transition 
product revenue  which includes revenue from the sale of hardware and software  decreased approximately in fiscal from fiscal this decrease is the result of the termination of the pmtc distribution agreement in september  the cessation of the company s marketing of pmtc s pt modeler tm product and the shift to the sale of the company s own technology acquired in the fiscal acquisitions of the advanced manufacturing technology division of cimlinc amt and the adra systems business of matrix one  incorporated adra 
the market for the pt modeler tm software is a mainstream d market and the sale price for this software was approximately  the cam technology acquired by the company in the amt acquisition has a much higher sale price  approximately  per unit  and is marketed primarily to the plastic injection molding and the tool and die industries 
this specialized product offered to a niche market  sold on the basis of improved throughput  allows for a higher sales price per unit than the d design software previously marketed by the company 
product revenue decreased approximately in fiscal from fiscal  also 
this decrease resulted primarily from the company s transition on october  from being a reseller of pro engineer tm software sold primarily on unix hardware to the pt modeler tm family of software operating exclusively on intel based machines 
service revenue increased approximately from fiscal to fiscal this increase of approximately million is the result of the two services only businesses acquired in the second half of fiscal contributing for the entire year in fiscal  the expansion of the company s consulting services business and the services revenue generated from the acquisitions of the technology companies amt and adra in fiscal service revenue increased nearly from fiscal to fiscal  or about million 
this increase was primarily the result of the fiscal acquisitions of the services only businesses discussed previously 
product gross margins improved to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal this improvement is the result of the termination of the pmtc distribution agreement in september  the sale of the company s own technology beginning in november which has a gross margin of about and the reduced hardware revenue generated in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal product gross margins increased from and in q and q  respectively  to and in q and q  respectively  with the technology acquisitions 
it is anticipated that the product gross margins will continue to increase in fiscal as an increased percentage of product revenue is derived from the sale of the company s own software technology 
product gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal the increased margin was the result of the transition to the pt modeler tm family of products with a margin and an indirect commission included in product revenue 
this indirect commission was earned by the company for pmtc direct sales of pro engineer tm software into the company s pro engineer tm customer base for the period from october  to december  the pro engineer tm software sold by the company in fiscal had a margin of between and 
service gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this improvement is partially the result of the company s acquisition of amt in november and the higher margins enjoyed by that business unit on service offerings as compared to the company s fiscal experience 
in addition  the increase in business generated from the consulting services group  which carries a higher bill rate  and the improved average billing rates experienced by the service group overall as a result of an increased demand for these type of services within the marketplace  have caused the service margin to increase in fiscal relative to service gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the improvement from fiscal to was due primarily to the additional higher margin services revenue generated from the fiscal acquisitions of the services only businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately in fiscal from  an increase of approximately million 
approximately or million of that increase was the result of increased headcount related to the acquisitions and internal expansion over the last two years 
infrastructure expenses related to facilities accounted for approximately  of the increase and non cash expenses primarily related to amortization of goodwill and software accounted for approximately  of the increase 
selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal increased from fiscal a one time charge of  was included in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
before this one time charge the increase from to was approximately which was the result of increased operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of the services only businesses in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the results from continuing operations included realized gains on available for sale securities of  and  respectively 
these gains resulted from the distribution of shares received in the sale of the company s nsg business in september as described in the company s form k filing in item business under the caption discontinued operations and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption results of operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately  which included a current federal tax provision of  partially offset by a deferred federal tax benefit of  the current federal tax provision was reduced by the use of net operating loss carryforward benefits 
in addition  the effective tax rate includes foreign taxes of  and state and local taxes of  the effective tax rate for fiscal was zero as a result of a federal tax benefit of  offsetting a state tax provision of  the federal tax benefit was generated from a current federal tax provision of  which was offset by the recovery of  of taxes paid in fiscal through the utilization of net operating losses nol carried back 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was that related primarily to state and local taxes 
as of may   the company has research and development tax credits of approximately  available to offset future federal taxes that may be payable 
capital resources and liquidity the company s cash position as of may  was  this represents a decrease of approximately  from the fiscal year end balance of  in addition  as described below  the company has substantially increased its debt level from fiscal year end these short and long term debt arrangements were entered into in order to acquire the adra business 
at fiscal year end the company had short term borrowings of approximately million 
these borrowings included a million short term note due on or before july  related to the adra acquisition  million of borrowings under the company s million line of credit arrangement and a million short term bridge loan extended by greenleaf capital to facilitate the adra acquisition 
the president of greenleaf capital is also a member of the board of directors of the company 
in addition to the short term borrowings  the company also entered into a long term borrowing arrangement with greenleaf capital whereby the company received million repayable in approximately four years 
these funds  together with the senior facility described below  were utilized to acquire the adra business 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company entered into a million senior loan facility 
the proceeds from this senior facility were utilized to pay off the million short term note and to pay off the borrowings under the million line of credit 
this million line of credit has been terminated 
approximately million of the bridge loan was also paid down with the proceeds from the senior facility 
the short and long term debt of approximately million including the million senior facility entered into subsequent to fiscal year end going into fiscal adds an element of financial risk that the company has not experienced in the past 
the terms of the senior facility require certain levels of profitability on a quarterly basis in order to remain in compliance with the loan covenants 
in addition  the company is completely dependent on cash flow from operations to meet its near term working capital needs and to make debt service payments 
the monthly interest expense is approximately  on these borrowings 
in addition  the term loan portion of the senior facility requires principal repayments of  on a quarterly basis beginning august as noted previously  the loan covenants on the senior facility require that the company maintain certain minimum financial ratios in order to remain in compliance with the loan terms 
the key financial ratios are summarized as follows o operating cash flow expressed as a ratio to debt service principal and interest expense must be in excess of  o total funded debt expressed as a ratio to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization may not exceed  o ebitda expressed as a ratio to interest expense may not be less than  and o ebit must be in excess of  for the fiscal quarter ended february  and  for each fiscal quarter thereafter 
while the debt load and the loan covenants summarized above add a significant level of financial risk to the company  the financial model which assumes approximately growth from the adra business  approximately growth for the amt business and growth for the services business generates sufficient cash flow and profitability to meet the debt service requirements  provide working capital and increase the cash balance throughout the year 
however  future operating results are dependent on a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include  but are not limited to  market acceptance of the company s prospector tm technology  continued revenue generated from the cadra tm product family  the ability to assimilate the acquisitions into the company  the ability of senior management to manage the expected growth and the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel both in our existing markets and in new office locations 
approximately of the cadra tm revenue has previously been generated from the asian market and part of the future growth of the prospector tm technology revenue is anticipated from that market 
it is anticipated that the growth projected from the asian market can be replaced with better than forecasted growth from north america and western europe in the near term  however  prolonged instability in the asian market could have a detrimental impact on growth in fiscal years beyond year in general  the year issue is a looming problem for many companies in that many computer programs have been written using two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year with the company s acquisitions in fiscal it became a software developer and owner of technology for the first time 
as part of those acquisitions  sellers represented through discussions and company management attempted to verify through due diligence procedures that the technology acquired in each acquisition was year compliant 
management has continued to verify such compliance since the acquisitions 
it is management s assessment that the company s technology  to the extent that it is time sensitive  allows for date recognition using four digits thereby reducing or eliminating the risk associated with the year issue for its own technology 
however  the company has not determined the impact of third party technologies which interface and communicate with its technology at its customers sites 
during fiscal  the company will replace its financial computer software including all underlying subledger modules which will be year compliant 
the third party package chosen is in the process of being implemented 
the expected out of pocket cost of purchasing this package is estimated to be approximately  the expected cost of implementing this package  which will be performed by the company s internal resources  is not expected to be material 
the company has been working with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to a failure by any of these third parties to correct their year problems 
there can be no assurance that the technology of other companies on which the company s systems and technologies rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations
