each of these factors  and others about the company  the premium wine industry and general business and economic conditions  is discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
change in fiscal year end effective with the fiscal year ending march   the company changed its fiscal year from one ending on december to one ending on march accordingly  the company reported a three month transition period ending march  the company determined that the nature of its business cycle  with typically heavy sales activity towards the end of the calendar year  coupled with the fall harvest of its grapes  created difficulty in efficient and effective planning and budgeting on a calendar year basis 
a fiscal year ending march occurs at the end of what is historically the least active quarter with respect to sales activity and operations in the production of wine 
the company elected to file audited financial statements for the transition period referred to above 
in accordance with applicable regulations  this report includes consolidated balance sheets as of march  and december  and consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended march  and december  and  respectively 
with a view to providing comparative information which more effectively highlights significant trends in the company s financial condition and results of operations  this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial information for the twelve month periods ending march  and march   unless otherwise indicated 
see item  selected financial data for schedule discussed herein 
results of operations the following table represents financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the indicated periods year ended march  year ended december  net revenues gross profit other revenues from operations selling  general and admin 
expenses operating income other income expense equity in net income of duhart milon minority interest net earnings loss wine sales net revenues for the year ended march  increased approximately over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was due to a increase in the number of cases  as well as a similar increase in the average sales price per case 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased by over the prior year comparable period 
this increase was due to both unit and price increases at all five wineries and in the imported wines distributed by the company 
unit sales in the california market have remained relatively flat over each of the three years ended march   and excluding custom brands and comprise of total unit sales for the year ended march  although california is the largest market for the company no single market outside of california accounted for more than of total sales in these years  management believes that increased unit sales in markets outside of california continue to account for most of future revenue growth 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  increased by approximately  or million over the comparable period in the preceding year  resulting primarily from the increases in sales quantities and sales price per case mentioned above  combined with a relatively low increase in cost of sales per case 
gross profit for the year ended march  was million as compared to million in the year ended march  for those two periods  gross profit as a percent of net revenues for the year increased to for the year ended march  from 
this increase in gross profit is attributable to both an increase in unit sales  as well as price increases across all brands and a shift in the product mix of wines sold to higher margin wines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  increased by over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase is primarily the result of planned increases in marketing expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased approximately from prior comparable period 
this increase was largely due to increased selling and marketing costs associated with increased unit sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for each of the two years ended march  and remained flat at for the comparable period in  due to expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales during that period 
operating income operating income for the year ended march  increased by over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was due to higher unit sales and gross margins per case as discussed above 
additionally  crushing fees received from third party wineries has consistently increased over the past three years  and comprised of the operating income for the year ended march  compared to in the prior comparable period 
operating income for the year ended march  increased over the prior comparable year 
this increase was due to higher sales  increased gross margins  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  all discussed above 
other income expense  net the increase of in net other expense between the years ending march  and was primarily driven by a increase in net interest expense  due to slightly higher borrowing levels 
interest expense for the year ended march  decreased to million  a decrease of from million in the prior comparable period 
this was made possible by the conversion of million of convertible debentures to equity in november of and the reduction of short term borrowings resulting from million in new equity received at the same time 
equity in net income of duhart milon effective october   the company exchanged its ownership interest in dbr for a interest in societe civile chateau duhart milon 
the effect of this transaction was to convert an interest in dbr  accounted for using the cost method  into an interest in an active  operating vineyard and winery operation  accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company s equity interests in duhart milon s net income for the years ending march  and were  and  respectively 
this increase of is primarily attributable to exceptionally strong demand for the bordeaux wines and corresponding increases in prices of the wines 
minority interest the edna valley vineyard evv and canoe ridge vineyard  llc crv individual financial statements are consolidated in full within the company s financial statements 
the interest in the net earnings of evv and crv which thus belongs to parties other than the company is accounted for as minority interest 
this minority interest in earnings losses of these ventures for the three years ended march  consisted of the following in thousands year ended march  minority venture minority owner percent edna valley vineyard paragon vineyard co  inc canoe ridge vineyard  llc various canoeco partners crvi the minority interest in earnings for the year ended march  increased over the comparable period ended march   due to steadily improving performance at both evv and crv primarily as a result of increases in gross margins per case 
the minority interest in earnings for evv for the year ended march  represents an increase of from the prior comparable period 
similarly  the minority interest for crv increased significantly 
both increases were due to improved performance at both evv and crv 
company management believes that evv and  to a lesser degree crv  will both continue to contribute significantly to the company s consolidated income statement 
net earnings net earnings for the year ended march  was million  an increase of over the comparable year ended march   primarily as a result of increased sales revenue  as discussed above 
net earnings for the year ended march   were million compared to  in the year ended march  this increase reflects increased unit sales at higher gross margins  lower interest expense and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  all of which are discussed above 
seasonality the company s wine sales from quarter to quarter are highly variable due to  among other things  the timing of the release of wines for sale and changes in consumer demand 
sales are typically highest during the fourth quarter because of heavy holiday sales and because most wines are released around the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarters 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  temporary inefficiencies in processing transactions  sending invoices  or engaging in similar normal business activities 
the company has an ongoing program designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by year software failures 
while the company believes it is doing everything technologically possible to assure year compliance  it is to some extent dependent upon vendor cooperation 
the company also recognizes that any year compliance failures could result in additional expenses to the company  the materiality of which cannot be predicted at this time 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased million during the year ended march  to  primarily as a result of increased inventory levels as of march   in light of anticipated increased sales activity for the upcoming year 
as of january  the company obtained an increase of million to in aggregate available bank lines of credit  of which million was outstanding as of march  these lines are secured by substantially all of the company s inventory and accounts receivable  bear interest at libor plus and mature in june  at which time management expects to renew the lines for one to two years 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of march   up from  as of march  as of march   the company also had bank lines of credit in the aggregate amount of million available  of which million was outstanding  as compared to million outstanding as of march  wine sales have historically provided sufficient revenues to sustain the company s on going operational requirements except during grape harvesting  when the company has relied on short term borrowings to finance grape purchases and the increased seasonal payroll 
major capital projects such as expansion of facilities or acquisition of vineyards have been funded with debt and equity issues and bank borrowings 
for example  the company invested approximately  in the year ended march  for the expansion of the facilities at edna valley vineyard and the vineyards at acacia and chalone vineyard  all of which were funded with long term borrowings 
future capital commitments include general vineyard development at all of the company s vineyards  as well as the planned building of a barrel storage facility on the site of the recently purchased vintage lane property 
management intends to fund such projects with additional bank borrowings and the proceeds obtained from the exercises of warrants which occurred in march and april of see discussion below  as well as from the anticipated settlement with pg e 
see item  business  significant events carmenet fire 
the company recently received net proceeds of million million in march  and million in april from the issuance of  shares of its common stock upon the exercise by the principal holders of all the company s outstanding warrants issued on march  the warrants  which it anticipates using for the reduction of existing short term indebtedness  working capital and the foregoing capital projects
