liquidity and capital resources the company s financing activities require substantial amounts of capital  and its ability to originate new financing transactions is dependent on the availability of cash and credit 
the company currently has access to credit under the revolver  its securitization transactions with bravo and capital  and loans secured by financing contracts 
the company obtains cash from sales of its financing contracts under its securitization facilities and from lease and note payments received 
substantially all of the assets of hpsc and acfc and the stock of acfc have been pledged to hpsc s lenders as security under hpsc s various short and long term credit arrangements 
borrowings under the securitizations are secured by financing contracts  including the amounts receivable thereunder and the assets securing the financing contracts 
the securitizations are limited recourse obligations of the company  structured so that the cash flow from the securitized financing contracts services the debt 
in these limited recourse transactions  the company retains some risk of loss because it shares in any losses incurred and it may forfeit the retained interest  if any  that it has in the securitized financing contracts should a default occur 
the company s borrowings under the revolver are full recourse obligations of hpsc 
most of the company s borrowings under the revolver are used to temporarily fund new financing contracts entered into by the company and are repaid with the proceeds obtained from other full or limited recourse financings and cash flow from the company s financing transactions 
at december   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to  at the end of as described in note c to the company s consolidated financial statements in the annual report   of such cash was restricted pursuant to financing agreements as of december   compared to  at december  cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in the significant components of cash provided by operating activities for as compared to were an increase in net income in to  from  in  an increase in the gain on sales of leases and notes to  in from  in  which was caused by a higher level of sales activity in  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  including accrued interest  of  as compared to  which was caused primarily by the issuance of subordinated debt and higher senior note balances in cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in and  in the primary components of cash used in investing activities for as compared to were an increase in originations of lease contracts and notes receivable to  in from  in  offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of lease contracts and notes receivable to  in from  in cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  for december  and  in the significant components of cash provided by financing activities in as compared to were proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt of  in and an increase in the proceeds from senior notes in to  from  in  offset by repayments of senior notes in of  compared to  in on december   the company raised  through an asset securitization transaction in which its wholly owned subsidiary  funding i  issued senior secured notes the funding i notes at a rate of 
the funding i notes were secured by a portion of the company s portfolio which it sold in part and contributed in part to funding i 
proceeds of this financing were used to retire  of senior notes due december   and  of subordinated notes due january  the funding i notes had an outstanding balance of  at december  and were fully paid in june of the revolving loan agreement was extended on december  until march  with availability of  the revolver was amended and restated on march  to increase the availability to  and to extend its term to march under the revolver  the company may borrow at variable rates of prime and at libor plus to  dependent on certain performance covenants 
at december   the company had  outstanding under this facility and  available for borrowing  subject to borrowing base limitations 
the revolver agreement is not currently hedged and is  therefore  exposed to upward movements in interest rates 
as of january   the company  along with its newly formed  wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary bravo  established a  revolving credit facility structured and guaranteed by capital markets assurance corporation capmac 
under the terms of the facility  bravo  to which the company has sold and may continue to sell or contribute certain of its portfolio assets  pledges its interests in these assets to a commercial paper conduit entity 
bravo incurs interest at variable rates in the commercial paper market and enters into interest rate swap agreements to assure fixed rate funding 
monthly settlements of principal and interest payments are made from the collection of payments on bravo s portfolio 
hpsc may make additional sales to bravo subject to certain covenants regarding bravo s portfolio performance and borrowing base calculations 
the company is the servicer of the bravo portfolio  subject to meeting certain covenants 
the required monthly payments of principal and interest to purchasers of the commercial paper are guaranteed by capmac pursuant to the terms of the facility 
the company had  outstanding under the bravo facility at december   and in connection with this facility  had separate interest rate swap agreements with bankboston with a total notional value of  effective november   the bravo facility was increased to  and amended to provide up to  of such facility to be used as sales of receivables from bravo for accounting purposes 
the company had  outstanding from sales of receivables under this portion of the facility  and in connection with this portion of the facility  had six separate interest rate swap agreements with bankboston with a total notional value of  at december  in april   the company entered into a fixed rate  fixed term loan agreement with springfield institution for savings sis under which the company borrowed approximately  at subject to certain recourse and performance covenants 
in july  the company entered into another fixed rate  fixed term loan agreement with sis under which the company borrowed an additional  at subject to the same conditions as the first loan 
the company had  outstanding under these agreements at december  the company s existing senior secured debt  issued in connection with certain securitization transactions as shown on the balance sheet contained in the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere  reflect its approximate fair market value 
the fair market value is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the same maturity 
in march  the company issued  of unsecured senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated note bearing interest at a fixed rate of the note offering 
the company received approximately  in net proceeds from the note offering and used such proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver agreement 
in june  the company  along with its wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  hpsc capital funding  inc capital  established a  lease receivable purchase agreement with eaglefunding capital corporation eagle 
under the terms of the facility the capital facility  capital  to which the company may sell certain of its portfolio assets from time to time  pledges or sells its interests in these assets to eagle  a commercial paper conduit entity 
capital may borrow at variable rates in the commercial paper market and may enter into interest rate swap agreements to assure fixed rate funding 
monthly settlements of the borrowing base and any applicable principal and interest payments will be made from collections of capital s portfolio 
the company will be the servicer of the capital portfolio subject to certain covenants 
the agreement originally expired in september effective january  the agreement was amended to extend the expiration date to september the company had  of indebtedness outstanding under this facility at december   and in connection with this facility had six separate swap agreements with a total national value of  in  the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock for approximately  the company may repurchase its common stock from time to time at prices favorable to the company  although it has no specific repurchase plan in place at this time 
management believes that the company s liquidity  resulting from the availability of credit under the revolver agreement  the bravo facility  the capital facility and loans from savings banks  along with cash obtained from the sales of its financing contracts and from internally generated revenues is adequate to meet current obligations and future projected levels of financings and to carry on normal operations 
in order to finance adequately its anticipated growth  the company will continue to seek to raise additional capital from bank and non bank sources  make selective use of asset sale transactions in and use its current credit facilities 
the company expects that it will be able to obtain additional capital at competitive rates  but there can be no assurance it will be able to do so 
inflation in the form of rising interest rates could have an adverse impact on the interest rate margins of the company and its ability to maintain adequate earning spreads on its portfolio assets 
certain considerations the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
hpsc cautions the reader that such list of considerations may not be exhaustive 
hpsc undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
dependence on funding sources  restrictive covenants 
the company s financing activities are capital intensive 
the company s revenues and profitability are related directly to the volume of financing contracts it originates 
to generate new financing contracts  the company requires access to substantial short and long term credit 
the company s principal sources of funding for its financing transactions are i the revolver  providing up to million of borrowing availability  ii million in limited resource resolving credit facilities with bravo and capital  iii fixed rate  full recourse term loans from a savings bank  iv specific recourse sales of financing contracts to savings banks and other purchasers  and v the company s internally generated revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to renew or extend the revolver at its expiration in march  complete additional asset securitizations or obtain other additional financing  when needed and on acceptable terms 
the company would be adversely affected if it were unable to continue to secure sufficient and timely funding on acceptable terms 
the agreement governing the revolver the revolver agreement contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants  and failure to meet such covenants would result in a default under the revolver agreement 
moreover  the company s financing arrangements with bravo and the savings banks described above incorporate the covenants and default provisions of the revolver agreement 
thus  any default under the revolver agreement will also trigger defaults under these other financing arrangements 
in addition  the indenture contains certain covenants that could restrict the company s access to funding 
securitization recourse  payment restriction and default risk 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company utilizes asset securitization transactions with wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries to seek fixed rate  matched term financing 
the company sells financing contracts to these subsidiaries which  in turn  either pledge or sell the contracts to third parties 
the third parties recourse with regard to the pledge or sale is limited to the contracts sold to the subsidiary 
if the contract portfolio of these subsidiaries does not perform within certain guidelines  the subsidiaries must retain or trap any monthly cash distribution to which the company might otherwise be entitled 
this restriction on cash distributions could continue until the portfolio performance returns to acceptable levels as defined in the relevant agreements  which restriction could have a negative impact on the cash flow available to the company 
there can be no assurance that if the portfolio failed to perform within the specified guidelines  its performance would return to acceptable levels or that the payment restrictions would be removed 
customer credit risks 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in connection with payments due under financing contracts originated by the company whether or not such contracts have been securitized  held as collateral for loans to the company or  when sold  a separate recourse reserve is maintained at a level which the company deems sufficient to meet future estimated uncollectible receivables  based on an analysis of the delinquencies  problem accounts  and overall risks and probable losses associated with such contracts  together with a review of the company s historical credit loss experience 
there can be no assurance that this allowance or recourse reserve will prove to be adequate 
failure of the company s customers to make scheduled payments under their financing contracts could require the company to i make payments in connection with its recourse loan and asset sale transactions  ii lose its residual interest in any underlying equipment and iii forfeit collateral pledged as security for the company s limited recourse asset securitizations 
in addition  although the company has stringent underwriting policies in approving financing contracts and the net charge offs on the contracts originated by the company have been approximately of the company s average net investment in leases and notes for  any increase in such net charge offs or in the rate of payment defaults under the financing contracts originated by the company could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing  including its ability to complete additional asset securitizations and secured asset sales or loans 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or reduce its current level of credit losses 
competition 
healthcare provider financing and asset based lending are highly competitive 
the company competes for customers with a number of national  regional and local finance companies  including those which  like the company  specialize in financing for healthcare providers 
in addition  the company s competitors include those equipment manufacturers which finance the sale or lease of their products themselves  conventional leasing companies and other types of financial services companies such as commercial banks and savings and loan associations 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing and operational resources than the company 
moreover  the company s future profitability will be directly related to its ability to obtain capital funding at favorable funding rates as compared to the capital costs of its competitors 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include many larger  more established companies that have a lower cost of funds than the company and access to capital markets and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in its targeted markets 
equipment market risk 
the demand for the company s equipment financing services depends upon various factors not within its control 
these factors include general economic conditions  including the effects of recession or inflation  and fluctuations in supply and demand related to  among other things  i technological advances in and economic obsolescence of the equipment and ii government regulation of equipment and payment for healthcare services 
the acquisition  use  maintenance and ownership of most types of medical and dental equipment  including the types of equipment financed by the company  are affected by rapid technological changes in the healthcare field and evolving federal  state and local regulation of healthcare equipment  including regulation of the ownership and resale of such equipment 
changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare and medicaid programs and other third party payors  such as insurance companies  as well as changes in the reimbursement policies of managed care organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  may also affect demand for medical and dental equipment and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in healthcare payment policies 
the increasing cost of medical care has brought about federal and state regulatory changes designed to limit governmental reimbursement of certain healthcare providers 
these changes include the enactment of fixed price reimbursement systems in which the rates of payment to hospitals  outpatient clinics and private individual and group practices for specific categories of care are determined in advance of treatment 
rising healthcare costs may also cause non governmental medical insurers  such as blue cross and blue shield associations and the growing number of self insured employers  to revise their reimbursement systems and policies governing the purchasing and leasing of medical and dental equipment 
alternative healthcare delivery systems  such as health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed care programs  have adopted similar cost containment measures 
other proposals to reform the united states healthcare system are considered from time to time 
these proposals could lead to increased government involvement in healthcare and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s customers 
healthcare providers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investment in medical and dental equipment 
future changes in the healthcare industry  including governmental regulation thereof  and the effect of such changes on the company s business cannot be predicted 
changes in payment or reimbursement programs could adversely affect the ability of the company s customers to satisfy their payment obligations to the company and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
interest rate risk 
except for approximately million of the company s financing contracts  which are at variable interest rates with no scheduled payments  the company s financing contracts require the company s customers to make payments at fixed interest rates for specified terms 
however  approximately million of the company s borrowings currently are subject to a variable interest rate 
consequently  an increase in interest rates  before the company is able to secure fixed rate  long term financing for its financing contracts or to generate higher rate financing contracts to compensate for the increased borrowing cost  could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to secure additional long term financing and to generate higher rate financing contracts is limited by many factors  including competition  market and general economic conditions and the company s financial condition 
residual value risk 
at the inception of its equipment leasing transactions  the company estimates what it believes will be the fair market value of the financed equipment at the end of the initial lease term and records that value typically of the initial purchase price on its balance sheet 
the company s results of operations depend  to some degree  upon its ability to realize these residual values as of december   the estimated residual value of equipment at the end of the lease term was approximately million  representing approximately of the company s total assets 
realization of residual values depends on many factors  several of which are not within the company s control  including  but not limited to  general market conditions at the time of the lease expiration  any unusual wear and tear on the equipment  the cost of comparable new equipment  the extent  if any  to which the equipment has become technologically or economically obsolete during the contract term  and the effects of any new government regulations 
if  upon the expiration of a lease contract  the company sells or refinances the underlying equipment and the amount realized is less than the original recorded residual value for such equipment  a loss reflecting the difference will be recorded on the company s books 
failure to realize aggregate recorded residual values could thus have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of receivables 
as part of the company s portfolio management strategy and as a source of funding of its operations  the company has sold selected pools of its lease contracts and notes receivable due in installments to a number of savings banks 
each of these transactions is subject to certain covenants that require the company to i repurchase financing contracts from the bank and or make payments under certain circumstances  including the delinquency of the underlying debtor  and ii service the underlying financing contracts 
the company carries a recourse reserve for each transaction in its allowance for losses and recognizes a gain that is included in income for accounting purposes for the year in which the transaction is completed 
each of these transactions incorporates the covenants under the revolver as such covenants were in effect at the time the asset sale or loan agreement was entered into 
any default under the revolver may trigger a default under the loan or asset sale agreements 
the company may enter into additional asset sale agreements in the future in order to manage its liquidity 
the level of recourse reserves established by the company in relation to these sales may not prove to be adequate 
failure of the company to honor its repurchase and or payment commitments under these agreements could create an event of default under the loan or asset sale agreements and under the revolver 
there can be no assurance that a continuing market can be found to sell these types of assets or that the purchase prices in the future would generate comparable gain recognition 
dependence on sales representatives 
the company is  and its growth and future revenues are  dependent in large part upon i the ability of the company s sales representatives to establish new relationships  and maintain existing relationships  with equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers and with healthcare providers and other customers and ii the extent to which such relationships lead equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers to promote the company s financing services to potential purchasers of their equipment 
as of december   the company had field sales representatives and eight in house sales personnel 
although the company is not materially dependent upon any one sales representative  the loss of a group of sales representatives could  until appropriate replacements were obtained  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on current management 
the operations and future success of the company are dependent upon the continued efforts of the company s executive officers  two of whom are also directors of the company 
the loss of the services of any of these key executives could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  the company has generally experienced fluctuating quarterly revenues and earnings caused by varying portfolio performance and operating and interest costs 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that quarterly comparisons of the results of its operations during any fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that results for any one fiscal quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance
