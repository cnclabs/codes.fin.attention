item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview the company was founded in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitive and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
the company s products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the wafer and disk manufacturing processes 
the company operates in two major business areas  the semiconductor group and the computer disk group 
the semiconductor group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on wafer surfaces 
the computer disk group is primarily engaged in the production of metrology systems for the computer hard disk industry 
a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
moreover  during the past fiscal year approximately of the company s revenue was derived from sales made to wafer manufacturers  with the remainder of the revenue derived principally from sales to manufacturers of semiconductor devices and computer hard disks 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders often consist of multiple systems  which can range in price from approximately  to  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on the company s revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon shipment 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods the services are provided 
the company does not provide the right to return products 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered and all significant contractual obligations have been met 
revenue from software consulting services provided on a time and reimbursable expense basis is recognized as the services are provided 
customer support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual periods the services are provided on september  ade software corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired substantially all of the assets  and assumed certain liabilities of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc ssd  in exchange for million in cash 
the company incurred  in transaction costs related to the acquisition 
ssd  located in burlington  vermont  provides yield enhancement and defect analysis software applications to the semiconductor industry and has been integrated into the company as ade yield enhancement solutions 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  representing research and development which had not reached technological feasibility and which had no alternative future use  which resulted in a charge to the company s operations of million 
in addition  million was allocated to existing software technology 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill was approximately million 
the operating results of ssd have been included in the company s results from the date of acquisition 
on june   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the pst agreement  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  merged with phase shift technology  inc pst  an arizona corporation 
pst designs  manufactures and markets a broad line of high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced optical interferometric technology 
pursuant to the pst agreement  each outstanding share of pst common stock was exchanged for two shares of the company s common stock 
a total of  shares of the company s common stock were issued in this transaction 
this transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  upon issuance of financial statements inclusive of the date of merger  all prior period financial statements will be restated as if the merger occurred at the beginning of such periods 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenue represented by the respective line items in the company s consolidated statement of income 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development purchased in process research and development marketing and sales general and administrative income from operations other income net income fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of the company s products 
the increase in unit sales resulted primarily from strong demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor industry and increased throughput in the company s manufacturing operations 
additionally  the company experienced increased demand for its gaging equipment used in the computer disk drive industry 
the company is currently developing product enhancements and new products designed to meet increasing demand for metrology and inspection equipment for advanced millimeter and millimeter wafers 
a competitor of the company has begun shipping optical inspection products for advanced millimeter and millimeter wafers 
the company believes that its next generation product  for which beta units have been shipped to customers  will be technologically superior to the competitor s new product 
until the company begins shipping production units of its next generation product  the company s sales of its wafer inspection systems could be adversely affected 
the company has been adversely affected by a general slowdown in capital equipment spending in both the semiconductor and computer disk drive industries 
additionally  the current financial uncertainty within the economies of certain asian countries has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect the company 
these effects have included and could include delay or cancellation of orders  postponement of delivery dates  price concessions and extended payment terms on product sales 
the company remains cautious about when growth in these industries will return 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to costs associated with increased manufacturing capacity and overhead expense 
the company operated in its new headquarters and expanded manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts and expanded facilities in its charlotte  north carolina manufacturing site during all of fiscal compared to only the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company also purchased and renovated its former manufacturing facility in newton  massachusetts during fiscal  which currently serves as the headquarters of the company s ade technologies  inc ati subsidiary  which markets to the computer hard disk industry 
additionally  the company has increased its worldwide customer service organization to support its higher levels of system sales  with the related personnel and travel costs contributing to a lower overall gross margin 
gross margins in the near future may be adversely affected by the distribution of fixed overhead costs over lower sales volume  price concessions on product sales or increased customer service costs as a percentage of total revenue 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the continuing delays in expected volume sales of millimeter equipment and the company s belief that a second generation of millimeter products will become available by the time volume purchases begin resulted in significantly increased expenditures on the company s millimeter surface inspection and wafer thickness products 
the company also continues to develop upgrades and enhancement features to its current products as its semiconductor industry customers seek to improve their yields on millimeter wafers 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in expenses reflects the growth of the marketing and sales organizations to support the company s increased sales volume  with the decrease as a percentage of revenue reflecting growth in expense at a slower rate than the overall increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
expenses increased as the company continued to develop management infrastructure to support its rapid growth 
fiscal expenses included million in additional bad debt reserves due to the adverse economic conditions in certain asian countries as well as the impact of the semiconductor industry downturn on certain domestic customers 
other income 
other income was million in fiscal versus  in fiscal fiscal interest income of million was partially offset by interest expense of  associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts and the headquarters and primary manufacturing facility of the company s ati subsidiary in newton  massachusetts 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively  and differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of benefits from the use of a foreign sales corporation by the company  state income taxes and tax credits

the company s quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly due to a number of factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and computer hard disk industries  the timing of shipments of orders to major customers  the mix of products sold by the company and competitive pricing 
customers may cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as cost of revenue includes manufacturing overhead  which is relatively constant from quarter to quarter  gross margins can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to varying levels of production and revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in any future period 
marketing and sales expenses can vary from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors  including mix of sales channels  geographic mix and timing of marketing events 
fourth quarter adjustments the company recorded a million credit to the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included a million credit resulting from the difference between the company s actual effective tax rate for fiscal of and the estimated effective tax rate of utilized during the first three quarters of fiscal also in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed accrued employee bonus expense of million  which had been recorded in the first two quarters of fiscal the difference between the company s actual effective tax rate and the estimated effective tax rate used in the first three quarters of fiscal resulted primarily from the effect of a million pre tax loss for the three months ended april  compared to pre tax income of million for the first nine months of fiscal and larger than anticipated federal and state research and development tax credits  due in part to increased expenditures in the fourth quarter of fiscal the reversal of the accrued bonus expense reflects the company s cost reduction measures during the current semiconductor and computer disk drive industry downturns 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
in addition  the company had million in restricted cash held as security for the tax exempt industrial development bond the idb issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency mifa described below 
net cash provided by operating activities prior to investments in working capital for fiscal was million 
this amount was comprised of net income of million  a decrease in total accounts receivable of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  purchased in process research and development of million and a million charge related to the company s equity in net losses of affiliated companies 
these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in deferred income tax benefits and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
the increase in deferred income tax benefits is primarily due to the purchased in process research and development charge of million  which is deductible over a fifteen year period for tax purposes 
investments in working capital consisted primarily of increased inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and million  respectively  as well as aggregate reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million 
cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million for purchases of fixed assets  million for the acquisition of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc  million of additional investments in and advances to affiliated companies and million in restricted cash used to secure the december idb described below 
included in the fixed asset purchases was million to purchase  refurbish and equip ati s new headquarters in newton  massachusetts 
during the next fiscal year  the company anticipates investing between million and million in a new facility for pst in tucson  arizona to provide additional manufacturing capacity as pst s products and technology are integrated with those of the company 
net cash provided by financing activities was million 
cash provided by financing activities consisted of million received as net proceeds from a public offering of  shares of the company s common stock completed in august  million in proceeds from the idb issued through mifa in december and million in tax benefits related to the exercise of common stock options 
these amounts were partially offset by  in repayments of long term debt 
the december idb carries an interest rate of  with of the outstanding principal payable monthly on a ratable basis for years with the remaining due in december the proceeds from the idb were used to finance the purchase and renovation of the ati facility  with the related debt secured by million in cash pledged by the company as collateral 
this cash is classified as restricted cash on the april  balance sheet 
under the terms of the bond agreement  the company may substitute a letter of credit in an amount equal to of the outstanding principal balance as collateral for the company s obligations under the idb  allowing the restricted cash balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
the company also issued a million idb in june  which carries an interest rate of and requires monthly principal and interest payments of  through june  when the remaining principal balance of million becomes due

in december  the company entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit facility the credit facility with a bank  with a maximum borrowing amount of million 
the credit facility provides the company the option of borrowing at either the bank s prime rate or the bank s libor rate plus 
the credit facility expires and all outstanding amounts thereunder are due december  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at april  since inception  the company has satisfied its cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations  private placements and an initial and follow on public offering of the company s common stock  bank borrowings and equipment financing 
the company believes that cash from operations  existing cash resources and bank borrowings  together will be adequate to fund operations for at least the next months 
the company s long term capital requirements will be affected by many factors  including the success of the company s current and anticipated product offerings  the company s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and general trends in the semiconductor wafer and device industries 
the company plans to finance its long term capital needs with existing cash reserves and interest earned thereon  revenue from product sales  bank loans  leases and debt financings 
to the extent that such funds are insufficient to finance the company s activities  the company will have to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or through other means

some of these actions have already been and others remain to be completed 
the company is planning to complete all year upgrades to its major systems  both internal and those included in the company s products  in calendar additionally  the company s suppliers have been sent letters requesting information regarding their own year compliance efforts  as well as requesting confirmation that the components and services provided by these suppliers are year compliant 
based upon its initial assessment  the company has concluded that year issues at its facilities should not have a material impact on its financial or operating performance 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies upon which the company s systems and business rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
while the company does not believe the year issue will have a material impact on the company  there can be no assurance that unanticipated problems will not arise that will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations
