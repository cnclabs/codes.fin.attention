item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview total revenue was million for  compared to million for net income was million for  an increase of from million for revenues and net income increased primarily due to higher revenues from design wins ramping into production during and the effect of acquisitions 
on april   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of intel corporation intel that were dedicated to the design  manufacture and sale of all standard and custom multibus i and multibus ii products multibus 
on february   the company purchased substantially all the assets of sonitech international  inc  a provider of digital signal processing hardware and software solutions for embedded applications 
both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
the results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the financial statements since the dates of acquisition 
except for the historical statements and information  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements business conditions and growth in the electronics industry and general economies  both domestic and international  uncertainty of market development  dependence on a limited number of oem customers  dependence on limited or sole source suppliers  dependence on the relationship with intel  dependence on intel s support of the embedded computer market  lower than expected customer orders  competitive factors  including increased competition  new product offerings by competitors and price pressures  the availability of parts and components at reasonable prices  changes in product mix  dependence on proprietary technology  technological difficulties and resource constraints encountered in developing new products  and product shipment interruptions due to manufacturing difficulties 
the forward looking statements contained in this md a regarding industry trends  product development and introductions  and liquidity and future business activities should be considered in light of these factors 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income  net income before income tax provision income tax provision net income years ended december    and revenues 
revenues increased to million for from million for the increase in revenues in resulted primarily from design wins ramping into production during and reporting a full year of revenues in from the acquisition of multibus on april  for  sales to the company s largest customers constituted of revenues  as compared to and for and  respectively 
revenues increased to million for from million for the increase in revenues in resulted primarily from the acquisition of multibus from intel on april  and from volume increases in oem sales 
additionally  included within revenues for is million of royalty payments from intel in connection with backlog retained by intel pursuant to the terms of the acquisition 
gross margin 
gross margin for decreased to from for because of lower margin design wins ramping into production 
the company s general business model is to price its products for new design wins at roughly gross margins  because the company believes this gross margin represents the best elasticity point to maximize design wins and long term growth 
as such  the company expects gross margins to decline gradually over time as new design wins ramp into production 
typically  products ramp into production to months after the design is won 
gross margin for increased to from for primarily as a result of royalties received from intel for backlog retained in connection with the multibus acquisition  component price decreasing faster than price changes to the company s customers  the mix of product sold through distributors versus direct sales  and product mix for consisting of a larger portion of higher margin products shipped relative to lower margin products shipped 
additionally  included within cost of goods sold for is million of inventory valuation adjustments that resulted from purchase accounting in connection with the multibus acquisition 
oem sales are characterized by longer product life cycles and generally lower gross margins that can vary throughout the product life cycle 
gross margins are typically lower in the early stages of production for oem sales and have the potential to improve over time 
the company establishes gross margin targets based on the nature of the sales it is pursuing and the desire to establish new oem relationships by pricing aggressively to achieve key sales 
however  many of the factors affecting gross margins  such as variances in unit volumes and timing of orders and component cost  are difficult or impossible to predict and can cause the company to be subject to unplanned margin variances 
gross margins on oem sales are also particularly sensitive to changes in customer mix because of both margin variances among individual products and the relative importance of a single large sale on overall operating results 
to mitigate the effect of short term margin variances  the company may employ step pricing techniques in which unit prices decline over the life of the product to reflect anticipated production efficiencies and or component cost reductions  or various cost sharing or cost plus pricing techniques that serve to reduce the margin risk to the company 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of increased investment in new product development 
the company continues to invest in new design wins for oem customers and the dollar increases reflect steady increases in the number of employees working in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily as the result of increased investment in new product development and costs of enhancements to existing products 
also included within research and development for is  to expense in process research and development acquired in connection with the multibus acquisition 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for  and to million for from million for selling  general and administrative expense have increased primarily as a result of increased personnel  facilities  and travel  to support higher levels of sales since and to support the acquired multibus operations in selling  general and administrative expenses have steadily declined as a percentage of revenues to for  from and for and  respectively  primarily as a result of operating efficiencies achieved by spreading fixed costs over a larger revenue base  offset partially by increases in costs required to expand international operations 
interest income  net 
interest income  net remained stable at million for and  and increased for from for the increases for were primarily the result of interest income earned from the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering in october income tax provision 
the income tax provisions for  and reflect effective income tax rates of  and  respectively 
the increases in the provision for income tax are primarily attributable to the exhaustion of the majority of the company s tax loss carryforwards in and the depletion of tax credits in liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash and equivalents  which represents the company s principal source of liquidity 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million 
the working capital balance increased primarily due to cash generated from operations and the increase in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of increased sales of the company 
net cash provided by or used for operating activities was   and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely attributable to increases in accounts receivable of million and in inventories of million in connection with the expansion of the company s operations

amounts outstanding under the line of credit will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s prime rate 
the company has not drawn any funds under this line of credit 
capital expenditures were   and million in  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of leasehold improvements  manufacturing equipment  and plant modernization 
the company moved to a new headquarters and manufacturing facility in october  and took possession of a new engineering design facility in december in addition the company purchased in early two adjacent parcels of land and in early one adjacent parcel of land for future expansion 
capital expenditures for the next months  including expenditures related to the new engineering design center  are expected to range from million to million 
the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there is no assurance that the company will not require additional financing prior to the expiration of months 
year issues the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
the company is addressing this issue to ensure the availability and integrity of its financial systems and the reliability of its operational systems 
the company has and will continue to make certain investments in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant 
the financial impact on the company has not been and is not anticipated to be material
