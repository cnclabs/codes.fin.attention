item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table contains income and expenses from the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
fiscal year total revenue total cost of sales and revenue gross profit margin selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses  net acquisition related expenses write off of goodwill total operating expenses earnings loss from operations total other expense income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenue increased by for fiscal to  compared to fiscal this growth was a result of increased revenues from the acquisitions of converter power  inc astex cpi in may and sorbios gmbh astex sorbios in october  increased sales to semiconductor capital equipment customers  and increased sales of specialty power supplies 
semiconductor related revenues  including revenues from astex cpi and astex sorbios  increased by  or for fiscal compared to fiscal with the biggest increase coming from sales of rf generators 
specialty power supply revenues  including revenues from astex cpi  increased by  or for fiscal compared to fiscal with most of the growth due to the revenues from astex cpi 
the astex cpi and astex sorbios acquisitions added incremental sales of  and  respectively compared to fiscal  or of total revenue 
without these acquisitions  revenues increased to  from  an increase of 
research contract revenue declined by  compared to fiscal other revenue consisting of service  spare parts and repairs were approximately of total revenue in fiscal and fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of astex cpi whose products have a lower gross margin than other products sold by the company 
in addition  gross profit margins were impacted by volume declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
the company is consolidating several manufacturing facilities in order to improve gross margins and reduce fixed costs 
in the first half of fiscal  the company plans to consolidate its modesto  california facility into its woburn  massachusetts and colorado springs  colorado sites and its beverly  massachusetts facility into woburn 
the company expects to record one time costs for these consolidations in the first quarter of fiscal of up to million 
the company continues to seek to develop and introduce products having higher gross margins and to focus on improving manufacturing efficiencies and methods to improve gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses increased by to  in fiscal  but decreased as a percent of revenue to from in fiscal increased selling expenses were primarily a result of the acquisitions of astex cpi and astex sorbios 
general and administrative expenses were flat as a percent of revenue at  although total general and administrative expenses increased by to  compared to fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions 
research and development net research and development expenses decreased as a percent of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal net research and development expenses increased by to  gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct costs of research contracts increased by to  astex has developed and introduced a number of new technology products including astron for cvd chamber cleaning  liquozon for wafer cleaning  rf for hdp cvd and new laser power supplies for medical applications 
the company is committed to continued investments in research and development in order to advance its position as a market and technological leader 
as a part of the acquisition of astex sorbios in fiscal  a valuation process was performed to establish the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as part of this process  the company incurred an expense of  for in process research and development 
this compares with acquisition related expenses of  incurred with the acquisition of astex cpi in fiscal operating income operating income increased to  or of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding one time charges for acquisition related expenses in both years  operating income increased by  or 
the increase in operating income is a result of increased sales and lower expenses as a percent of revenue 
other expenses and income taxes interest expense decreased to  in fiscal compared to fiscal  while interest income increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense and the increase in interest income is a result of conversion of warrants issued in connection with the company s ipo in november see footnotes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the sale of an investment in low entropy systems  inc  which resulted in a one time gain of  income tax expense increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenue increased by for fiscal to  compared to fiscal this growth was the result of acquisitions as total sales to semiconductor capital equipment customers were flat due to an industry downturn during the first three quarters of fiscal astex eto  acquired half way though fiscal  provided most of the growth 
sales of specialty rf power sources for medical applications increased by  in fiscal over the acquisition of astex cpi  inc completed on may  added  of revenue in fiscal research contract revenue was approximately of total revenue in both fiscal and other revenue consisting of service  spare parts and repairs increased by to  in fiscal  primarily due to astex eto which obtains a larger fraction of its total revenues from this category 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisitions of astex eto and astex cpi whose products have lower gross margins than other product lines in the company 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by new product introduction ramp up costs  reduced volumes on existing products  and increased inventory reserves 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses decreased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal selling expenses decreased due to the consolidation of the company s semiconductor sales activities and a reduction in headcount  promotional costs  and travel expenses compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by to  in fiscal but decreased as a percent of sales compared to fiscal during fiscal there was an additional six months of astex eto and two months of astex cpi general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal despite these additions  cost reductions reduced the overall level of the increase 
research and development net research and development expenses increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct costs of research contracts increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased gross spending resulted in significant design wins during the year and the introduction of three new products at year end 
a valuation process was performed in fiscal in order to establish the fair values of the cpi assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as part of this process  the company incurred an expense of  for in process research and development 
this compares to acquisition related expenses of  incurred in fiscal operating income operating income was  in fiscal compared to a loss of  in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  associated with the astex eto acquisition 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding one time charges for acquisition related expenses and the write off of goodwill  operating income in fiscal would have been  or of total revenue compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal the decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the increased r d investment and lower gross margins in fiscal other expense and income taxes interest expense in fiscal increased by to  compared to  in fiscal  while interest income in fiscal decreased by to  compared to  in fiscal these changes were the result of the use of cash for the acquisitions of astex eto and astex cpi  and increased borrowings to fund these acquisitions 
income tax expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal the expected tax computed by applying the us federal corporate income tax rate of to earnings loss before income taxes was increased by  due to one time charges of goodwill amortization and write off and acquisition related expenses which were not tax deductible 
there were no comparable costs in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations the company s foreign revenues are generally denominated in us dollars 
the acquisition of astex sorbios gmbh increased the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  however  significant astex sorbios business is conducted with us companies in dollars which reduces the foreign exchange fluctuation risk 
foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
over time  as the company seeks to expand its operations in europe and the far east  more revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies  increasing the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had cash and short term investments of  with working capital of  compared to june   when the company had cash and long term investments of  and working capital of footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of recent acquisitions completed by the company 
these include sorbios gmbh in october  cpi in may   eto in january  and nes in november in november  the company completed an ipo and received net proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock at per share and  five year redeemable warrants at per warrant 
on september  the company announced that it had met the requirements for the redemption of its redeemable warrants and called the warrants for redemption 
net proceeds to the company as a result of the conversion of warrants to common stock were  the proceeds were used to repay all bank debt  to complete the astex sorbios acquisition  and increase working capital 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october the company purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock of low entropy systems  inc les 
in august   the company sold all of its shares of les to balzers and leybold us holding  inc for  during fiscal  the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net  for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of  for the acquisition of sorbios gmbh   for additions to property  equipment  and patents  offset by sales of  in investments primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills and  from the sale of the company s investment in les 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of repayment of bank debt for  and proceeds from issuance of common stock for  which was primarily from the redemption of warrants and exercise of stock options by employees

investments are primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from notes payable of  offset by note repayments of  and proceeds of  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of employee stock options 
the proceeds from notes payable resulted from additional borrowings for the acquisition of astex cpi  while the repayments were primarily a result of debt restructuring for the acquisition 
during fiscal  the company generated  in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net  for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of  for the acquisition of astex eto less cash acquired with the acquisitions of astex eto and astex nes   for additions to property  equipment  and patents   for the purchase of an equity investment in les  and  for the purchase of investments  offset by sales of  in investments 
investments were primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
the company s cash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from two notes payable for  used in the acquisition of astex eto and  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of investor warrants and exercise of employee stock options  offset by  of note repayments 
the company has a credit facility with state street bank and trust company which consists of an  unsecured demand line of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this facility is subject to the company meeting certain financial covenants which are tested quarterly 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants 
there were no outstanding borrowings as of the date of this report  and as of june  and june  the line of credit expires in may the company continues to use its cash resources for developing new products  expanding sales and marketing  performing collaborative product development projects  and for general working capital 
the company continues to seek joint ventures and or acquisitions that will enhance the company s position in its markets with the potential to increase revenue growth and profitability 
the company has issued a letter of intent to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of a us technology company for approximately  to be paid in a combination of cash and or astex stock 
this transaction is subject to adjustment and is expected to be completed in late the company has adequate financial resources to complete this acquisition within its existing credit facility 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that existing cash resources  investments  anticipated cash flows from operations and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses and working capital requirements for a period of at least the next months 
the company may seek to raise additional capital for acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  although no specific financing is planned at this time 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal and  the company will be required to adopt several new accounting pronouncements 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated operating expense levels  gross margin estimates and the availability of funds to meet cash requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
customer concentration relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
sales to the company s ten largest customers in fiscal years   accounted for   and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal years    sales to applied materials  the company s largest customer in each of these periods  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the company expects that sales to applied materials will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future  although the acquisitions of astex sorbios and astex cpi are expected to provide some reduction on the reliance on applied materials 
although a number of the company s customers do enter into long term supply agreements  these agreements typically allow the customer to cancel orders with limited penalties 
a reduction or delay in orders from applied materials or other significant customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry  could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
dependence on cyclical industries the company s business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demands for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results may be materially adversely affected by semiconductor industry downturns or slowdowns 
the semiconductor industry currently has excess capacity for most types of devices  which has caused semiconductor manufacturers to significantly decrease their levels of capital spending 
in the personal computer market  a shift in demand from more expensive  high performance computers to lower priced models has resulted in reduced profitability for semiconductor manufacturers  resulting in delays and further decreases in capital spending 
the company anticipates that at least the first half of fiscal will be adversely affected by the current semiconductor capital equipment downturn as a result of these factors 
the company is restructuring its operations  reducing its workforce and consolidating several facilities to reduce its fixed costs  and will incur consolidation costs as discussed above under the gross profit comparison of fiscal to continued overcapacity in the semiconductor industry and strengthening demand for lower priced computers could cause continued weakness in demand for the company s products 
reliance on oem customers  lengthy sales cycle the company s products are primarily sold to oems which incorporate the company s products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor manufacturers in their purchase of the oem s equipment  these manufacturers demand highly reliable products which require as long as several years for oems to develop 
the company s revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of its oem customers in developing and marketing equipment incorporating the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any equipment incorporating the company s products will be marketed successfully by the company s customers 
asian economies asian countries are having economic difficulties that are causing economic slowdowns or recessions in those countries 
the region does not appear to be responding to efforts to stimulate its economies 
asia has historically been an important region for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
if these economies do not recover in the near future  the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry may be extended in time or reduced in scale 
the economic difficulties of these countries could also have a negative impact on the economies of the us and europe  leading to further declines in demand for the company s products 
japanese market the japanese semiconductor equipment markets are large and difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
the company believes that increasing its penetration of the japanese market is important to its business  and that it is currently at a competitive disadvantage to japanese suppliers  many of which have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese semiconductor process equipment manufactures 
moreover  the company s ability to compete effectively in the japanese markets may be limited by the company s size and its geographic location 
although the company intends to expand its direct presence in japan  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant sales to  or compete successfully in  japan 
foreign revenues the company does business worldwide  both directly and via sales to united states based oems who sell such products internationally 
in fiscal years   and  foreign revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the company anticipates that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenues  which will result in a significant portion of the company s revenues and operating results being subject to risks associated with foreign revenues  including united states and foreign regulatory and policy changes  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing representatives  and foreign currency fluctuations 
highly competitive industry the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
a number of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selling its products to oems  regardless of the performance or the price of the company s products 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
new products and technological change the semiconductor manufacturing industry has been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products that meet customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
management of growth and consolidation the company has recently gone though a period of rapid growth and is now going through a period of consolidation 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract and retain highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there can be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire and retain such personnel 
the company s expansion and contraction may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support the company s operations 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and market price of securities the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of significant orders and shipments of its products  changes and delays in product development  new product introductions by the company and its competitors  the mix of products sold by the company and competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  a number of the company s microwave plasma processing and diamond deposition systems have high selling prices 
as a result  quarterly variations in systems sales could significantly affect the company s operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the marketing price of the company s securities could also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the semiconductor industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 
effects of inflation the company believes that  over the past three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating results 
year disclosure the company believes that its financial reporting and enterprise resource planning erp systems will be year compliant by december the company is currently in the process of updating its financial reporting and erp systems with sap r  which has been represented as being year compliant by its producer 
astex is currently using sap r in its major facility in woburn  ma 
the consolidations of agl and astex cpi into woburn will remove the requirement for these locations to implement new software packages 
the current erp software packages used by astex eto  solomon and max  are represented as being year compliant 
the current software package used by astex sorbios is not year compliant 
the company intends to purchase an upgrade that is represented as being year compliant and will implement this by december other software used by the company is generally certified by the vendor as year compliant or is not considered critical to the operations of the company 
the company has spent approximately  in fiscal on sap r software  hardware  consultants and internal costs 
the company plans future sap r implementation expenditures of approximately  during the next one to two years 
although the company believes its future sap r implementation cost estimates to be accurate  the company can not provide any assurance that these costs will not increase or that the implementations will occur by the dates estimated 
the source of funds for the fiscal expenditures was current operating cash flows and the company expects that future operating cash flows will be the source of funds for these expenditures in the future 
the company has not yet addressed the year preparedness of its critical suppliers and its major customers and related electronic data interfaces with these third parties 
during the coming year the company will contact critical suppliers and major customers to determine whether they are  or will be  compliant by the year the company expects to complete its assessment by the end of fiscal based upon this evaluation  the company will seek new vendors where necessary and formulate contingency plans to resolve customer related issues that may arise 
at this time the company can not estimate the impact that noncompliant suppliers and customers may have on the company or its level of operations in the year although the company has not made a systematic review of its products in operation at customer locations  it believes that a number of diamond deposition systems may not be year compliant 
over the coming year  the company plans to identify noncompliant product and offer to make all necessary modifications to make them compliant 
additional noncompliant products could be identified during this process 
because a formal identification program has not been completed  the company is unable to estimate the cost that will be incurred to remediate year problems related to noncompliant products that are in operations at customer locations 
during the current year the company will also conduct a review of its manufacturing equipment and facilities to ensure year compliance 
based on its initial assessment  the company does not anticipate that a material year issue will be discovered in this area 
the company will also formulate testing and contingency plans that will enable it to detect and effectively deal with problems that may arise as a result of year noncompliance 
because these reviews and testing have not been completed  the company is unable to estimate the total cost associated with addressing the year  nor what its liabilities to third parties may be as a result of year issues 
at this time  the company cannot give any assurance that it will be successful in completing its planned actions to become year compliant on or before the year additionally  no assurance can be given that instances of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition will be identified  that the systems of other companies with which the company transacts business will be corrected on a timely basis  that a failure by such entities to correct a year problem or a conversion which is incompatible with the company s systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition  or that even if all planned actions are completed  the company will not experience some adverse effects from year related issues
