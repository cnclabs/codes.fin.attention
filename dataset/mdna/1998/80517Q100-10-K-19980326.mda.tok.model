see notes c and d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the bank of israel s monetary policy has been to manage the exchange rate while allowing the consumer price index to rise by approximately in  in and in for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this has resulted in corresponding increases in these costs in us dollars 
in  and  the shekel was devalued by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar 
because of the insignificant devaluation of the shekel against the us dollar in and despite the annual rate of increase in the consumer price index  btg s costs of local goods and services  to the extent linked in whole or in part to the consumer price index  increased in us dollar terms 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
there can be no assurance that the government of israel will continue to devalue the shekel from time to time to offset the effects of inflation in israel

there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur

all of the cash proceeds of the financing were to be received by bio cardia 
in consideration of the bio cardia warrants included in the units  the company received from each purchaser of units an option the stock purchase option  exercisable at any time on or prior to december   to purchase the bio cardia stock at a purchase price beginning at and increasing over time to of the cash paid to bio cardia at the closing of the financing and in respect of the investor note  with any amounts then outstanding under the investor note being canceled

the company conducted research  development and clinical testing of these products on behalf of bio cardia  had the exclusive option  during the period the stock purchase option was outstanding with respect to each product  to commercialize  directly or through others  such product  and was obligated to supply bio cardia with all its requirements for such products 
in connection with the financing  on december   the company issued bio cardia warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  consisting of i the  bio cardia warrants issued to investors in bio cardia in consideration of their grant of the stock purchase option to the company  ii the  bio cardia warrants issued to d

bio cardia and the company had originally budgeted approximately  of the net proceeds of the financing less if the stock purchase option was exercised prior to january  to fund development and commercialization of the products licensed to bio cardia over a period of four years and to reimburse the company for previously incurred research and development expenses 
however  holders of units failed to make the required july  payment of  per unit  which resulted in bio cardia being unable to pay approximately  of the  in reimbursement of previously incurred research and development expenses and approximately  of the  of development costs due the company during the three months ended september  under a research and development agreement between the company and bio cardia pursuant to which the company performed research and development services on behalf of bio cardia in respect of the products licensed to bio cardia the r d agreement 
in october  bio cardia reached settlements with certain of the defaulting stockholders  holding an aggregate of units  who surrendered to bio cardia their bio cardia stock and bio cardia warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock the surrendered warrants in exchange for a release from their future funding obligations to bio cardia 
the net effect of this settlement was to reduce the funding expected by bio cardia by approximately  in addition  bio cardia commenced legal action against the remaining defaulting stockholders  holding an aggregate of units  who owed an aggregate of  which actions were settled during without the payment in the case of holders of units or recovery by bio cardia of any monies 
accordingly  bio cardia was not in a position to fund the up to  research and development program originally contemplated by bio cardia and the company 
the company did not recognize as revenues the amounts due from bio cardia during the second half of or during because of the uncertain realizability of such amounts 
the company funded a revised research and development budget for in addition  in may  bio cardia  with the company s consent  completed an exchange offer with all those bio cardia stockholders who were not in default under their investor note  who held an aggregate of units  including holders of three units against whom bio cardia commenced litigation the exchange offer 
under the terms of the exchange offer  bio cardia exchanged  in cash together with interest on  from the date bio cardia received such funds and forgiveness of  principal amount of the investor note remaining outstanding for each one share of bio cardia common stock and an unconditional release 
in addition  bio cardia agreed that if by december  neither i the average daily price of the company s common stock for any trading days in a consecutive trading day period exceeds nor ii the best closing bid price of the bio cardia warrants exceeds during any trading days  then bio cardia would distribute to the bio cardia stockholders accepting the exchange offer some or all of the surrendered warrants such that  in the aggregate  the  bio cardia warrants issued in the financing in each unit  together with the surrendered warrants distributed by bio cardia  have a value of  as determined using the black scholes option pricing formula using an assumption of no dividends and a volatility of 
at september   the best closing bid price of the bio cardia warrants had exceeded for trading days and  as a result  bio cardia s obligation to distribute the surrendered warrants expired 
at december   there was due to the company from bio cardia in excess of  for research and development performed by the company on behalf of bio cardia during and and for product purchases and advances for general and administrative expenses  which amounts had not been recognized as revenue by the company because of the uncertain realizability of such amounts for the reasons set forth above 
on december   bio cardia transferred to btg its interest in the surrendered warrants  the technology previously licensed to bio cardia by the company and the improvements to such technology resulting from the research and development conducted by the company on behalf of bio cardia in partial satisfaction of amounts owed to the company by bio cardia 
as a result  the company recognized research and development revenues under collaborative agreements of  representing the product determined by multiplying the surrendered warrants by  the closing bid price of the bio cardia warrants on september   the date bio cardia ceased to be obligated to distribute any portion of the surrendered warrants under certain circumstances as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph 
in  the company expensed  as research and development financing relating to bio cardia  representing the net funds provided to bio cardia following bio cardia s default under its agreements with the company
