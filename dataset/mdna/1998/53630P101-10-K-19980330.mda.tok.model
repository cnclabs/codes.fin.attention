item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new business activity and change of principal business emphasis in  the company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary  bridge financial corporation bridge or bfc  which acquired a portfolio of commercial real estate loans from rrh financial rrh 
through bfc  the company participates in the commercial real estate lending business by providing short term gap and participating loans to qualified borrowers who provide suitable real estate projects as collateral 
bridge acquired from rrh a portfolio of loans under management valued at million  of which million was participated with other lenders 
the remaining non participated balance of million net of undisbursed loan proceeds of 
million was the amount recorded by the company and included  together with new loans  in commercial real estate loans  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of the company 
at year end  the company transferred substantially all loans receivable secured by real estate on its books to bfc 
this was done to concentrate all significant lending in bfc 
this transfer  together with new loan originations  provided bridge with a year end loan portfolio under management of approximately million  of which million was participated and million net of an allowance for bad debts of 
million and undisbursed loan proceeds of 
million is included in commercial real estate loans  net in the company s year end consolidated balance sheet 
as of march  bridge has a loan portfolio under management of million  of which million is participated and million net of an allowance for bad debts of 
million and undisbursed loan proceeds of 
million is recorded in the company s books 
real estate lending as a principal business focus marks a new direction for the company 
historically  the company has been a real estate lender to some extent  but that lending was incidental to and in conjunction with the company s real estate development and sales business 
the company s management believes  however  that an under served niche exists in the real estate lending industry which merits the devotion of substantial company resources 
this niche  on which bridge will focus  consists of successful small to medium sized developers and others in the real estate business with a need to borrow  to  on a short term basis  secured by a low ratio mortgage typically a mortgage loan which is or less than the value of the property mortgaged on commercial real estate 
by providing a quick  responsive service management believes that bfc will be able to earn a premium return on loans it extends to these borrowers while maintaining a low to moderate risk profile 
the key reasons management believes it will be able provide a superior level of service and to be successful in this niche are that over time management expects the company to be able to secure lower cost and more consistent capital sources than other  smaller lenders that operate in this segment of the lending industry  and management expects to be able to maintain lower levels of general and administrative expense compared to other larger competitors 
management expects the lending business to provide more stable earnings patterns for the company when compared to the company s historical pattern 
this is because the earnings pattern in the real estate development and sales industry is very dependent upon the occurrence of large and sometimes isolated transactions  which are not readily predictable 
furthermore  an increase in real estate assets does not necessarily translate into a concurrent increase in revenue or earnings  such increases are often deferred until the asset is liquidated 
the lending business is  on the other hand  more likely to have a predictable stream of interest income from a portfolio of assets 
the assets begin to contribute to earnings immediately upon acquisition  consequently loan portfolio growth has a direct and immediate impact on earnings 
it is management s intention to shift the company s principal business focus away from real estate development and sales and toward commercial real estate lending 
most of the company s real estate assets are either in escrow or are being actively marketed for sale 
see item properties 
a large number of these sales are expected to close within the next to months  creating cash for re investment 
as these assets are sold  management intends to invest the proceeds principally in the real estate lending business 
however  since for federal income tax purposes the company has a very low basis in many of its properties  management may opt to defer payment of income tax upon the sale of such properties by exchanging the property for other income or development property 
the apportionment of the proceeds from sale of property between investment in bfc and investment in other real estate will be determined case by case  based primarily on the amount of income tax liability and the company s cash needs  considered together with other business factors 
the formation of bfc and the acquisition of a loan portfolio from rrh occurred late in the fiscal year 
consequently  the contribution of bfc to the earnings of the company for are not material 
management believes that the contribution to be made by bfc to the company s results of operations in future time periods will be material 
because of the anticipated increasing materiality of the bfc activity  management believes that the results of operations and other financial information presented for and prior years may not be indicative of the operating results for years subsequent to results of operations the following table summarizes the company s revenues and earnings for the indicated periods fiscal years ended december in thousands  except share data revenue    earnings per share of common stock basic diluted prior years restated to reflect a stock dividend paid july  year ended december  versus year ended december  earnings decreased in by approximately  from  in to  in the major reason for the decrease in earnings was the decrease in sales of real estate in fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter the presence of one large transaction which occurred in fourth quarter  with no comparable transaction in  accounted for approximately of the decline in earnings and revenue 
rental properties continued to produce steady gross profits and cash flows of just under  per year in the majority of the rental property cash flow is from the four federally subsidized apartment complexes that nz owns 
the subsidy contracts are scheduled to expire  one during fourth quarter and the other three in the first half of the company believes that these contracts will be renewed  but that the level of subsidy is likely be lower than under the current contracts 
the company does not believe that the expected lower subsidy level will have a significant effect on the company with respect to its apartment complex located in albuquerque  however  the lower subsidy level could be significant with respect to the company s apartment complexes located in other areas of new mexico 
the company is unable to determine the precise effect of the renewal rates until certain regulations are finally promulgated by the secretary of housing and urban development hud 
all four apartment complexes are currently listed for sale and as of march  a contract is being negotiated 
the increase in general and administrative expense of  or approximately  is due primarily to an increase in personnel costs and other costs related to the restructuring of the company s business activity and personnel to accommodate the integration of bridge financial corporation into the company s operations 
year ended december  versus year ended december  although property sales generated about  more in gross profit in than in  earnings decreased in by about  from  in to  in the major reason for the decrease in income was the sale of a note receivable and the sale of a joint venture property that produced over  in before tax income in rental properties continued to produce steady gross profits and cash flows of about  for the fiscal year 
the majority of the cash flow was from the four federally subsidized apartment complexes that nz owns 
the subsidy contracts are scheduled to expire  one at the end of and the other three in as of the end of the fiscal year it was not possible to determine whether hud would renew these contracts 
if hud does not renew the contracts when they expire  the company may have to adjust its rental rates 
the company does not believe that this would have an adverse effect on the company with respect to its apartment complex located in albuquerque  however  the lack of federal subsidies in the rural areas of new mexico could have an adverse effect on the company 
investment income decreased by about  a note receivable was paid off in  thereby reducing interest income in also average cash available for investment in was down from  due to the purchase of properties 
the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in officers and directors bonuses of about  and increased legal fees 
cash flow from operating activities increased by over  and cash flow from investing activities decreased by essentially the same amount 
the company sold two commercial corners for about  in cash and the company purchased two properties  a  acre ranch in colorado and a acre parcel in arizona 
cash on hand at december  was  liquidity and capital resources the company s capital needs have typically been for real estate development projects and to fund working capital 
the sources of these funds have been internally generated cash from property sales and rental operations  lines of credit and joint venture financing 
historically  these sources have been sufficient to meet the company s needs for cash 
the real estate lending business will require large amounts of capital in order for the company to be an effective competitor in the market 
management estimates that during the fiscal year  approximately million of principal will be required to fund anticipated loan volume 
in addition  the company will require cash for working capital  for continuing development work on existing real estate projects and for projects that may be acquired through tax deferred exchanges 
see new business activity and change of principal business emphasis  above 
the company expects to generate a substantial amount of cash from the sale of real estate over the next to months 
this cash will be re deployed into the lending or development business 
cash will also be generated from principal repayments on maturing loans in the company s existing loan portfolio 
in addition  the company now uses and intends to continue to use participants or other joint funding sources on certain real estate loans 
the company currently has a million unsecured revolving line of credit from a commercial bank  which can be used for general corporate purposes 
the line bears interest at the prime rate and expires in december  at december  the entire line was undrawn and available 
as of february  the line had an outstanding balance of million 
this loan contains financial covenants which require the company to maintain a specified minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities  a specified minimum excess of current assets over current liabilities  and a specified maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
at december  the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 
negotiations are underway with the bank to increase the size of the line to million  of which million would likely continue to be unsecured 
the balance would be secured by certain real estate and loan assets of the company 
the same commercial bank has made a construction loan to the company to finance development of the grove commons project 
the construction loan is for a one year term expiring december   and bears interest at the prime rate 
as of december  the loan had a zero balance 
as of february  the loan had an outstanding balance of  from a different commercial bank  one of the albuquerque joint ventures has loan facilities to be utilized for lot development 
at december  the aggregate outstanding balance under these loan facilities was  as of february   there was  borrowed against these lines of credit 
the company also has  revolving line of credit from a commercial bank which is secured by certain real estate 
the line bears interest at the prime rate and is scheduled to expire on april  the company does not intend to renew this line of credit 
at december  there was no amount outstanding on this line 
in addition to bank lines  the company is engaged in preliminary discussions with a large non bank commercial lender to provide a warehouse line of credit and or joint funding arrangement  either or both of which would be available to finance the company s real estate lending activities 
discussions have not proceeded far enough to characterize any likely loan agreement  other than to say that it will probably be a secured revolving facility 
the company expects to negotiate other similar credit facilities during the fiscal year 
the proceeds of any such facilities would be used to fund the company s real estate lending business 
the company also intends to seek qualified joint venture partners to finance large real estate development projects 
the use of joint venture partners provides a source of development capital  mitigates the company s risk by sharing it with another party  and gives the company access to expertise that it might not otherwise have for particular projects 
the principal outcomes of the company s discussions with potential lenders will be to determine how rapidly the company will be able to grow its new commercial real estate lending business 
the terms of any new financing arrangement will likely have a material effect upon the company s margins in its lending business 
if the company is not successful in negotiating such financing  the principal effect will be a modest growth in the company s lending business  with the pace of growth in the near term being determined at least in significant part by the timing of the company s sales of existing real estate assets 
inflation  deflation  and changing prices the results of operations may be affected by inflation  deflation  and changing prices 
price changes and market trends in real estate  rental rates  interest rates  oil  gas  and uranium could have significant effects on the company s operations 
while the company does not believe such items have had a material effect on operations and knows of no conditions which would cause the company to believe that such items could have a material effect on results  changes in prevailing interest rates and real estate values could have a significant effect on bfc s real estate lending business

factors that may affect future results and financial condition certain information presented in this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  which may have an effect on the company s future results and financial condition 
real estate market 
the company will continue to be linked to the fortunes of the real estate market 
a downturn in that market could adversely affect the company s performance 
the company is expecting to generate significant amounts of cash and earnings over the next to months through the sale of several real estate assets 
while the real estate markets are generally healthy in the areas where the company currently owns real estate  there is no assurance that the markets will continue to be favorable over the disposition period of these assets 
a downturn in the real estate market could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to sell its real estate assets at a profit or at all  and an adverse impact on the company s ability to attract joint venture funding for any future development projects  including the sedona project 
if that were to happen the company s growth  particularly the growth of bfc  could be restrained due to a lack of capital 
in addition  a downturn in the real estate market could have an effect on the company s real estate lending business 
if bfc finds it necessary to foreclose on properties after a default by a borrower  it is possible that the company would not  in the short term  be able to recover its entire investment in the loan 
also  in the past  downturns in the real estate market have resulted in a higher rate of foreclosures generally 
interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates can have a variety of effects on the company s commercial real estate lending business 
in particular  changes in interest rates affect the volume of loan originations and acquisitions  the interest rate spread on loans held for sale  and the amount of gain or loss on the sale of loans 
during periods of declining interest rates  the company typically experiences an increase in demand for loan originations because of increased commercial real estate development activity 
the company intends generally to hold loans that it funds in its loan portfolio  although it may sell participations in its loans to pension funds and other institutional investors 
the company s net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on loans held in its portfolio generally based on long term interest rates and the interest it pays on its borrowings generally based on short term interest rates 
to the extent short term interest rates are lower than long term interest rates  the company earns net interest income from the difference  or the spread  during the time the mortgage loans are held by the company 
to the extent this spread narrows  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s net interest income will be affected by borrowing costs other than interest expense associated with its borrowings 
delinquency  foreclosure and other credit risks  liabilities under representations and warranties 
economic downturns can have a negative impact on a real estate lender s profitability as the frequency of loan defaults tend to increase 
from the time that the company funds the loans it originates  to the time the loan is repaid or is earlier sold by the company  the company is generally at risk for any loan defaults 
once the company sells the loans it originates or sells participations in such loans  the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures passes to the purchaser of the loans 
however  in the ordinary course of business  the company makes certain representations and warranties to the purchasers of loans and to loan participants 
these representations and warranties generally relate to the origination and servicing of loans 
if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of these representations or warranties  the company becomes liable for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan 
in such a case  the company may be required to repurchase the loan or the loan participation and bear any subsequent loss on the loan 
loan participations 
bridge financial corporation occasionally retains only a portion of originated loans in its own portfolio and works with a participating lender to place the other portion of the loans in the portfolio of the participating lender 
most of the participations have been with pension funds who manage significantly larger funds than bfc 
the participants typically take a position senior to the company s position with respect to payment of the principal portion of the loans 
the participants also typically receive the same interest income and points as does bfc 
bfc normally receives an origination fee and a servicing fee on the participant s portion of the loan 
generally  by participating loans bfc is able to originate larger loans than it would normally originate without participants  but results in the company assuming a subordinate position with respect to repayment of principal in relation to the position of the loan participant 
loan participants and prospective loan participants may change their criteria for participating in loans  they may choose to not participate at all and they may decide to compete with the company in certain markets 
to the extent that loan participants and prospective loan participants may change the way in which they have participated in loans  the company may be unable to originate the size of loans it now plans and growth may be slowed 
availability of funding sources 
the company will require substantial capital resources to grow its commercial real estate lending business 
the amount of financing available to the company during the next to months will have a material effect upon how rapidly the company will be able to increase its lending activities 
the company is currently negotiating with certain lenders to provide a million revolving warehouse facility 
while the company expects to be able to obtain financing as its lending arrangements mature  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
to the extent that the company is not successful in arranging new financing  it may have to curtail its loan origination activities 
concentration of business 
a significant portion of the company s commercial lending business is conducted in arizona 
at december   all of the company s outstanding loans were secured by commercial properties located in arizona 
given the concentration of the company s business in arizona  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations would not be adversely affected to the extent arizona experiences a period of slow or negative economic growth which results in decreased commercial loan originations and or an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults 
competition 
the commercial real estate lending business is highly competitive 
the company competes with other non bank lenders  commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions in every aspect of its lending business  including funding loans and acquiring origination capabilities 
the company competes with financial institutions that have substantially greater financial resources  greater operating efficiencies and longer operating histories than the company 
to the extent that market pricing becomes more aggressive  the company may be unable to achieve its planned level of originations 
ability to enter new markets 
the ability of the company to make the transition to the lending business and to grow that business depends to a significant degree upon management s ability to originate loans in new markets in the southwestern united states 
this type of market expansion will require  among other tasks  hiring capable and experienced people  marketing to new markets  additional underwriting procedures for new markets  determining whether to open new offices or service the loans from the central phoenix office  and holding down overhead to keep the new markets cost effective 
failure to adequately perform any or all of these tasks effectively could significantly impair the company s ability to expand into new markets  and could materially and adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
control of costs 
cost control is always an important element in achieving profitable operations and is especially important during significant expansions of operations  such as the company s expansion into its new commercial real estate lending line of business 
management believes that a major factor that will allow the company to effectively compete with larger financial institutions in the southwestern united states is its ability to originate loans at lower overall costs than many of its competitors 
the principal cost categories that must be closely managed are capital cost and overhead cost 
the ability of management to control these costs is critical to achieving profitability as it expands into new markets 
dependence on key individual 
r 
randy stolworthy has been the chief architect of the company s transition from a real estate business to a lending business 
the company has no employment agreement with mr 
stolworthy 
if the company were to lose mr 
stolworthy s services for any reason  significant time and money would be expended to try to identify  recruit and employ replacement personnel to continue the transition  with no guarantees that such a person could be found 
year the company has developed an internal plan to address the year issue and management believes that the company is year compliant 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written in code which uses two digits rather than four digits to identify the applicable year 
the company s total cost of becoming compliant was insignificant 
because the company s business operations and related business routines are generally dependent upon date specific information  the company may experience operational interruptions due to year issues if its customers and suppliers are not year compliant 
the company is in the process of communicating with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company may be adversely impacted by those third parties year issues
