outlook since its inception in april  cell genesys has focused its research and product development efforts on human disease therapies which are based on innovative gene modification technologies 
cell genesys strategic objective is to develop and commercialize ex vivo and in vivo gene therapies to treat major  life threatening diseases and disorders 
cell genesys aids gene therapy currently is in phase ii human clinical testing and is being developed through a worldwide collaboration with hoechst marion roussel 
two types of cancer gene therapies  for which cell genesys currently has worldwide rights  are in phase i ii human clinical testing for the treatment of colon cancer  lung cancer  melanoma and prostate cancer 
preclinical studies are being conducted by cell genesys for the treatment of other cancer indications as well as for hemophilia  cardiovascular disease and neurologic conditions 
cell genesys assets outside of gene therapy include its licensing program in gene activation technology and its abgenix subsidiary  which is focused on the development and commercialization of antibody therapies 
during  cell genesys acquired somatix therapy corporation somatix  establishing a leadership position in gene therapy 
product research and development programs of the two companies were highly complementary  with cell genesys focused on the treatment of aids and cancer  and somatix focused on cancer  central nervous system diseases and other disorders 
technology research and development programs also were highly complementary  with synergies in the retroviral and adenoviral vector programs of both companies and with new adeno associated viral and lentiviral vector programs contributed by somatix 
integration of the two companies was completed by the end of  having prioritized the most promising programs  significantly reducing overall expenses of the combined businesses 
with the combined portfolio of product opportunities  technologies and intellectual property  cell genesys believes it has substantially increased its ability to attract new corporate collaborations to advance product candidates through development and commercialization and also has expanded its opportunities to license additional therapeutic genes from other companies and research institutes needed to create new gene therapies 
during  cell genesys made extensive progress in its gene therapy programs 
for the treatment of hiv infection  phase ii human clinical studies were expanded using t cell aids gene therapy  based on encouraging data from earlier clinical studies and widespread medical reports about the inability of current drug therapies to eradicate reservoirs of hiv  the aids causing virus 
for the treatment of cancer  phase i ii human clinical studies were initiated using t cell cancer gene therapy for colon cancer and using the gvax tm cancer vaccine for melanoma  lung cancer and prostate cancer 
hemophilia gene therapy entered preclinical testing and demonstrated long term production of a blood clotting protein that is deficient in patients with hemophilia 
cardiovascular gene therapy continued to show promise in preclinical testing for the prevention or inhibition of restenosis following angioplasty 
in cell genesys central nervous system gene therapy program  progress was achieved in preclinical studies evaluating the potential to slow or halt the degeneration of certain brain cells in parkinson s disease 
a new treatment indication  the management of uncontrollable pain associated with fatal illness  is also being evaluated 
in the human monoclonal antibody program being pursued through the company s subsidiary  abgenix  the company has developed transgenic technology to create strains of mice capable of producing human monoclonal antibodies 
these transgenic mice contain the majority of human antibody genes and could produce multiple product candidates 
the company believes that fully human antibodies should avoid the allergic reactions seen with antibodies containing mouse proteins  which should make them better suited to long term therapy and could provide a marketing advantage 
abgenix is focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies to treat a wide range of serious diseases  including transplantation associated conditions  inflammation  autoimmune disorders and cancer 
abgenix currently has five antibody products in development 
abgenix lead product candidate  abx cbl  is in confirmatory phase ii trials for treating steroid resistant graft versus host disease gvhd  a frequent  fatal and currently untreatable complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplants 
abx cbl has been tested in various acute transplant related conditions including gvhd  kidney and corneal transplant rejection in patients to date 
an ind has been filed for a second antibody product  abx il  and is expected to begin clinical trials in for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis 
the company s consolidated net cash expenditures for in its current operations are not expected to exceed approximately million and the company intends to manage toward this net cash expenditure target 
the company may from time to time evaluate opportunities to acquire or in license other potential products and technologies 
expenses associated with in licensing such products may constitute unbudgeted expenses 
results of operations revenue increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects revenues from the collaboration with hoechst marion roussel  inc which was entered into in for cell genesys aids gene therapy program  including a milestone payment of million earned during revenue under this agreement decreased slightly in hoechst marion roussel continues to fund this clinical development program in in february  cell genesys entered into an agreement to license the company s gene activation technology to hoechst marion roussel for erythropoietin epo and a second undisclosed protein 
the agreement provides for milestone payments and annual maintenance fees  in addition to royalties on future sales of these two potential gene activated protein products 
the company recognized revenue of million in pursuant to the agreement 
other revenues resulted from the company s joint venture xenotech with jt immunotech in its human monoclonal antibody program see note to financial statements 
revenue earned under this agreement decreased in and will continue to decrease in due to the completion of the majority of research activities 
also  the company received final payments of million in each of and under its agreements with akzo nobel nv for the license of a gene activated follicle stimulating hormone 
research and development expenses have increased to million during from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase reflects the costs of additional research staff transferred following the acquisition of somatix and expanding clinical development activities for the company s aids gene therapy and cancer gene therapy programs 
the increase also reflects abgenix contract manufacturing costs related to its lead antibody product candidate 
research and development expenses have generally represented approximately of the company s total operating expenses  excluding the effect of non recurring charges for the cross license and settlement and the acquisition of somatix and related restructuring 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase to support additional product development activities  particularly in the field of cancer  for which a number of trials commenced in the rate of increase depends on a number of factors including progress in research and development  especially clinical trials 
purchased in process technology costs and restructuring costs related to the acquisition of somatix on may  totaling million were incurred in the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition including in process technology were estimated based on independent valuations of the acquired net assets 
other costs related to the acquisition consist primarily of underwriting and other transaction related costs  employee severance payments  consolidation of facilities and the write down of the book value of certain fixed assets 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases reflect growth in administrative staff and outside services required to support expanded research and development programs  including facilities expenses related to abgenix lease of independent facilities and hiring of independent administrative staff in the company expects these expenses to increase as these programs expand 
in  the company reported expenses of million related to the company s cross license and settlement agreement with genpharm international  inc genpharm 
no such costs were incurred in or a million non recurring  non cash charge was recognized in the first quarter the additional million represents abgenix share of two patent milestone fees recognized in no further milestone fees will accrue under the agreement 
interest income was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to interest earned on million received by cell genesys during the fourth quarter of in connection with the equity investment made by hoechst marion roussel 
the decrease in was due to lower average cash balances during the year 
interest expense increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  due to higher levels of property and equipment financing and interest accrued on the note payable to genpharm 
cell genesys net loss increased to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this was primarily due to million in non recurring charges for the acquisition of somatix and related costs and million in non recurring charges related to the cross license and settlement agreement 
losses  excluding non recurring charges  are expected to continue and are likely to increase in future years as operating expenses rise  particularly as the company incurs expenses related to manufacturing and late stage human testing of its potential products 
at december   cell genesys had available net operating loss and research credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods due to the change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources cell genesys has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements and equipment financing 
from inception through february   the company received million in net proceeds from equity financings  million under collaborative agreements and utilized million of property and equipment financings 
at december   cell genesys cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  this increase of million was primarily due to million provided by two private placements of preferred stock completed by the company and its subsidiary  abgenix  which was offset by the use of cash in operating activities  payment of lease line obligations and payment of obligations incurred by somatix or related to the merger transaction 
cell genesys also had non cash charges of million for purchased in process technology related to the somatix acquisition  million for the genpharm convertible note and million accrued for a patent milestone fee related to the cross license and settlement agreement see below 
on march   the company announced that  along with abgenix  xenotech  lp xenotech  an equal joint venture of abgenix and japan tobacco and japan tobacco  it had signed a comprehensive patent cross license and settlement agreement with genpharm international  inc that resolved all related litigation and claims between the parties 
the cross license agreement includes a worldwide royalty free cross license to all issued and related patent applications pertaining to the generation of fully human monoclonal antibody technologies in genetically modified strains of mice 
the company also obtained a license to certain technology in the field of gene therapy held by genpharm 
as consideration for the cross license and settlement agreement  cell genesys issued a note due september  for million  convertible into shares of cell genesys common stock  initially at per share 
under the terms of the note  the conversion price will be reset at per share  effective april  of this note  million was contributed to  then paid by xenotech 
the entire amount of the note was recognized as expense by abgenix in the first quarter of based on an independent valuation analysis of technology acquired 
in addition  japan tobacco also made a cash payment to genpharm 
during  two patent milestones of million each under the agreement were met 
xenotech recognized expense of million  million of which was paid in cash with the remainder to be paid in november during  abgenix recognized an expense of million for its contribution due to xenotech for its share of the patent milestone obligations  of which million was paid in cash and million is accrued at december  the balance of the patent milestone obligations is the responsibility of japan tobacco 
no additional milestone payments will accrue under this agreement 
cell genesys anticipates that consolidated net cash expenditures will not exceed million in revenues under the agreement with hoechst marion roussel are expected to decrease in and have been prepaid by hoechst marion roussel 
in addition  the above referenced note payable to genpharm will come due september  and  depending on the cell genesys stock price at that time  may require cash settlement  at the option of the holder 
payment of the second milestone due genpharm will also be due in the company expects its cash requirements to increase significantly in the future 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the attraction and maintenance of collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  and the cost of litigation  patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings or their resolution 
cell genesys believes that its available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   together with payments to be received under the company s collaborative arrangements and license agreements and million in equipment financing available for capital equipment purchases will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements at least through thereafter  the company will require substantial additional funds 
because of the company s significant long term cash requirements  the company regularly considers financing alternatives  including the private or public sale of equity by cell genesys and by its subsidiary abgenix 
any such transaction may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
risk factors need for substantial additional funds 
the company and its subsidiary  abgenix  will require substantial additional funds to continue existing and planned preclinical and clinical trials and its research and development activities  and to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products it may develop 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with payments to be received under existing collaborative agreements and amounts available under existing equipment financing facilities  will enable the company to maintain the company s operations at least through beyond such time  the company and abgenix will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  including  but not limited to  the continuation of the collaboration with hoechst marion roussel  continued scientific progress in its research and development programs  the magnitude of such programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in collaborative relationships  the terms of any additional collaborative arrangements into which the company may enter  the company s ability to establish research  development and commercialization arrangements pertaining to products other than those covered by existing collaborative arrangements  the cost of establishing manufacturing facilities  the cost of commercialization activities  and the demand for the company s products if and when approved 
there is no assurance that opportunities for in licensing technologies or for third party collaborations will continue to be available to the company on acceptable terms 
a major portion of the company s operating revenues are derived from a collaborative agreement with hoechst marion roussel signed in october under the terms of the agreement  hoechst marion roussel has the ability to terminate its commitment at any time two years after its anniversary date 
hoechst marion roussel is funding clinical development for this program in there is no assurance that hoechst marion roussel will continue the agreement or that the level of funding will not vary year to year 
the company s operating results would be adversely affected should hoechst marion roussel decide not to continue funding under this arrangement 
cell genesys expects to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financings  collaborative relationships  or otherwise 
because of these long term capital requirements  the company and its subsidiary  abgenix  may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable  even if it does not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
there can be no assurance that any such additional funding will be available to the company  or  if available  that it will be on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of its research  development and clinical activities or to seek to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
early stage of development  no developed or approved products 
cell genesys potential gene therapy products are in research and development 
no revenues have been generated from the sale of any of such products  nor are any such revenues expected for at least the next several years 
the products currently under development by cell genesys will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that cell genesys research and development efforts will be successful or that any commercially successful products will ultimately be developed by cell genesys 
even if developed  these products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit cell genesys to operate profitably 
technological uncertainty 
gene therapy is a new technology  and existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of gene therapy are limited 
data relating to cell genesys specific gene therapy approaches are even more limited 
the company s t cell gene therapy for cancer  gvax tm cancer vaccine and aids gene therapy are currently being tested in phase i ii and phase ii human clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy 
none of the other products or therapies under development are in human clinical trials 
the results of preclinical studies do not predict safety or efficacy in humans 
possible side effects of gene therapy may be serious and life threatening 
there can be no assurance that unacceptable side effects will not be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of cell genesys potential products or thereafter 
there are many reasons that potential products that appear promising at an early stage of research or development do not result in commercialization 
although cell genesys is testing proposed products or therapies in human clinical trials  there can be no assurance that cell genesys will be permitted to undertake human clinical trials for any of its other products or that the results of such testing will demonstrate safety or efficacy 
even if clinical trials are successful  there is no assurance that cell genesys will obtain regulatory approval for any indication  or that an approved product can be produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost  or be successfully marketed 
patents and trade secrets 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including cell genesys  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
while cell genesys is prosecuting patent applications  it cannot be certain whether any given application will result in the issuance of a patent or  if any patent is issued  whether it will provide significant proprietary protection or will be invalidated 
because patent applications in the united states are confidential until patents are issued and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  cell genesys cannot be certain that it was the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
the commercial success of the company will also depend in part on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching licenses granted to cell genesys 
the company may be required to obtain licenses to third party technology and genes necessary to conduct its business 
any failure by the company to license at reasonable cost any technology or genes required to commercialize its technologies or products may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to cell genesys  or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
to determine the priority of inventions  interference proceedings are frequently declared by the united states patent office that could result in substantial costs to the company and may result in an adverse decision as to the priority of cell genesys inventions 
cell genesys is currently involved in three separate interference proceedings with regard to i gene activation technology  ii ex vivo gene therapy  and iii chimeric receptor technology 
while the company believes its position in each interference proceeding is strong  the outcome of each proceeding cannot be predicted  and an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property position and its business 
the company may be involved in other interference proceedings in the future 
cell genesys believes that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
cell genesys also relies on unpatented trade secrets and improvements  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or disclose such technology  or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets 
cell genesys requires its employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with it 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to an individual during the course of the employment or consulting relationship generally must be kept confidential 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while employed by cell genesys  relating to its business are the exclusive property of cell genesys 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
competition 
competition in the field of gene therapy from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and from research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase 
there are numerous competitors working on products to treat each of the diseases for which cell genesys is seeking to develop therapeutic products 
some competitors are pursuing a product development strategy competitive with cell genesys  particularly with respect to the company s human monoclonal antibody program 
certain of these competitive products are in substantially more advanced stages of product development and clinical trials 
the company s competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those being developed by cell genesys  or that would render the company s technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than cell genesys 
in addition  many of these competitors may have significantly greater experience than cell genesys in developing products  in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products  in obtaining united states food and drug administration the fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and in manufacturing and marketing such products 
accordingly  cell genesys competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval or commercializing products more rapidly than cell genesys 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain certain biological materials necessary to support its research  development or manufacturing of any of its planned therapies 
if the company is permitted to commence commercial sales of products  it will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency  areas in which it has limited or no experience 
it is anticipated that the company will build additional clinical scale and commercial scale manufacturing facilities to the extent that contract facilities are not available in order to commercialize its products 
it is also anticipated that the company will secure funding for these and other product development activities through its partners and future potential partners 
cell genesys also competes with universities and other research institutions in the development of products  technologies and processes 
in many instances  cell genesys competes with other commercial entities in acquiring products or technology from universities 
cell genesys expects that competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  patent  position  and sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
cell genesys competitive positions also depend upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between product conception and commercial sales 
the levels of revenues and profitability of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies such as the company may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
in the united states there have been  and cell genesys expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to control health care costs 
cell genesys cannot predict the effect health care reforms may have on its business  and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
in the united states and elsewhere  sales of therapeutic products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursements to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
if the company succeeds in bringing one or more products to the market  there can be no assurance that these products will be considered cost effective and that reimbursement to the consumer will be available or will be sufficient to allow the company to sell its products on a competitive basis 
operating loss and accumulated deficit 
cell genesys has incurred net losses since its inception 
at december   cell genesys accumulated deficit was approximately million 
such losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in its research and development programs  the acquisition of somatix and other new technologies  and to a lesser extent  from general and administrative expenses 
in  cell genesys incurred losses of million  including million related to the acquisition of somatix and million related to the cross license and settlement agreement with genpharm 
the company expects to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years due primarily to the expansion of research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing 
cell genesys expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market its products or ever achieve or sustain product revenues or profitability 
volatility of stock price 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including cell genesys have historically been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
factors such as fluctuations in cell genesys operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by cell genesys or its competitors  governmental regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the cell genesys common stock 
government regulation 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of cell genesys proposed products and its research and development activities 
all of cell genesys products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other premarket approval procedures by the fda and similar authorities in foreign countries 
since certain of cell genesys potential products involve the application of new technologies  regulatory approvals may take longer than for products produced using more conventional methods 
various federal and  in some cases  state statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of such products 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal statutes and regulations  requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by cell genesys or its collaborators or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by cell genesys  and its ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
in responding to a new drug application  or a product license application  the fda may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or if granted may not cover all the clinical indications for which cell genesys is seeking approval or may contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
in addition to laws and regulations enforced by the fda  cell genesys is also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and other present and potential future federal  state or local laws and regulations 
cell genesys research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and various radioactive compounds 
although cell genesys believes its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  cell genesys could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
the manufacturing facilities of cell genesys are subject to licensing requirements of the california department of health services 
while not subject to license by the fda  such facilities are subject to inspection by the fda as well as by the california department of health services 
a separate license from the fda is required for commercial manufacture of any product 
failure to maintain such licenses or to meet the inspection criteria of the fda and the california department of health services would result in disruption to the manufacturing processes of the company and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
for marketing outside the united states  cell genesys is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs and devices 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
failure to comply with such regulatory requirements or obtain such approvals could impair the company s ability to develop these markets and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
commercialization  lack of marketing experience 
it is anticipated that the company will rely on sales and marketing expertise of potential corporate partners for its initial products 
cell genesys does not have any experience in sales  marketing or distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
the decision to market future products directly or through corporate partners will be based on a number of factors including market size and concentration  the size and expertise of the partner s sales force in a particular market and the company s overall strategic objectives 
cell genesys is currently engaged in various stages of discussions with potential partners 
there can be no assurance that cell genesys will be able to establish such relationships  if at all  on acceptable terms and conditions 
product liabilities and insurance 
clinical trials or marketing of any of cell genesys potential products may expose the company to liability claims resulting from the use of such products 
these claims might be made directly by consumers  health care providers or by others selling such products 
cell genesys and abgenix currently maintain product liability insurance with respect to each company s clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such insurance or  if maintained  that sufficient coverage can be acquired at a reasonable cost 
an inability to maintain insurance at acceptable cost or at all could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing or commercialization of products developed by the company 
a product liability claim or recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
hazardous materials  environmental matters 
cell genesys research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and various radioactive compounds 
cell genesys is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
although cell genesys believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
the company may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
the company s operations  business or assets may be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
reimbursement 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of the company s potential products will depend in part upon coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  including health care organizations  government agencies  private health care insurers and other health care payers such as health maintenance organizations  self insured employee plans and the blue cross blue shield plans 
there is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of drug products 
in particular  reimbursement from government agencies and insurers and large health organizations may become more restricted in the future 
cell genesys potential products represent a new mode of therapy and  while the cost benefit ratio of the products may be favorable  cell genesys expects that the costs associated with the company s products will be substantial 
there can be no assurance that the company s proposed products  if successfully developed  will be considered cost effective by third party payers  that insurance coverage will be available or  if available  that such third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be provided by such third party payers at all or without substantial delay or  if such coverage is provided  that the approved reimbursement will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to become profitable 
uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing and related matters 
the future revenues and profitability of and availability of capital for biotechnology companies may be materially adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and cell genesys expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control 
while cell genesys cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
dependence upon key personnel and collaborative relationships 
cell genesys success is highly dependent on the retention of principal members of management and scientific staff and the recruitment of additional qualified personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
there is intense competition from other companies  research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel in the areas of cell genesys activities 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
these activities are expected to require the addition of new personnel with expertise in the areas of clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
the failure to acquire such personnel or develop such expertise could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
cell genesys has clinical trial arrangements with the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases covering the initial proof of principle study for aids gene therapy being conducted in identical twin pairs now in phase ii testing 
cell genesys also has clinical trial arrangements with the university of california  san francisco  san francisco general hospital  the university of colorado health sciences center  massachusetts general hospital  the university of california  los angeles  virx  inc and the aids research community consortium covering cell genesys patient specific configuration of its aids gene therapy also now in phase ii testing 
if these relationships were terminated  progress of clinical testing would be adversely affected 
in addition  the company has several clinical trial arrangements under its gvax tm program  including with the johns hopkins university covering a phase i clinical trial to treat prostate cancer patients and with the dana farber cancer institute covering two phase i clinical trials to treat lung cancer and melanoma patients 
in the event that any of these relationships are terminated  the completion and evaluation of clinical trials could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company has several clinical trial arrangements under its cc program  including with university of california  san francisco  stanford university and prn research  inc in the event that any of these relationships are terminated  the completion and evaluation of clinical trials could be adversely affected 
the company will depend  in part  on the continued availability of outside scientific collaborators performing research 
these relationships generally may be terminated at any time by the collaborator  typically by giving days notice 
the company s scientific collaborators are not employees of cell genesys 
as a result  the company has limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to the company s activities
