business development the company was established in and is one of the world s leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description  production enhancement and management services for optimizing reservoir performance and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery from new and existing fields 
the company s customers include major  national and independent oil and gas producers 
in addition  the company manufactures and sells petroleum reservoir rock and fluid analysis instrumentation and other integrated systems 
the company s business strategy is to continue the expansion of its operations through i continued development of proprietary hydrocarbon production enhancement technologies  services and products through client driven research and development  ii expanded services and product lines offered throughout the company s global infrastructure  and iii acquisition of complementary businesses that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing products and services 
the company s research and development efforts recently have been directed towards development of wireless electromagnetic telemetry em telemetry 
em telemetry allows the recording of bottomhole pressure and temperature data and the transmission of that data to the surface in real time 
usage of em telemetry allows actual pressure which is often significantly different than calculated pressure to be measured 
em telemetry has applications not only in conducting hydraulic fracturing and acid treatments  but also for daily maintenance of optimum production efficiency 
the company s acquisition strategy is to continue to seek acquisitions of complementary businesses that add key technologies  expand market presence and enhance the company s existing products and services

liquidity and capital resources on may   the company entered into an unsecured credit facility  which was used to finance the acquisitions of scott pickford and saybolt  as well as refinance a previous credit facility 
the unsecured credit facility provides for i a term loan of million  ii a term loan denominated in british pounds having a us dollar equivalency of million  iii a committed revolving debt facility of million and iv a netherlands guilder denominated revolving debt facility with a us dollar equivalency of million 
loans under the unsecured credit facility will generally bear interest from libor plus to a maximum of libor plus 
the term loans require quarterly principal payments beginning march  with the final principal payment due june  the revolving debt facilities require interest payments only  until maturity on june  the terms of the unsecured credit facility require the company to meet certain financial covenants  including certain minimum equity and cash flow tests 
management believes that the company is in compliance with all such covenants contained in its credit agreements 
as part of the purchase of scott pickford  the company issued unsecured loan notes as an alternative to the cash consideration paid for the outstanding shares of scott pickford 
the loan notes bear interest payable semi annually  at the rate of libor less per annum 
holders of the loan notes have the right to redeem the loan notes at par on each interest payment date 
unless previously redeemed or purchased  the loan notes will be redeemed at par on june  core laboratories has generally funded its activities from cash flow from operations  although the company financed substantially all of the purchase price for the acquisitions of scott pickford and saybolt and issued approximately  common shares to consummate the stim lab merger 
the company used existing cash and borrowed approximately million under the unsecured credit facility to fund i million paid in connection with saybolt acquisition  and ii to retire approximately million of its existing indebtedness 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million from the public offering to repay million in debt and the remaining million was retained for working capital 
of the million of debt repayment  million was repaid in december and million was repaid in january at december   the company had working capital of million of which million was cash and short term investments and a current ratio of to compared to working capital of million of which million was cash and short term investments and a current ratio of to at december  the company is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries 
consequently  the company s cash flow is wholly dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to the company 
all of the company s material subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under the unsecured credit facility 
the company expects to fund any future acquisitions primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations  bank borrowings including the unsecured credit facility  and issuances of additional equity 
although the unsecured credit facility imposes certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  in general the company will be permitted to assume  among other things  indebtedness of acquired businesses  subject to compliance with the financial covenants of the unsecured credit facility 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations will provide cash in excess of the company s normal working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures for were million and for totaled million 
due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in  and  inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations in recent periods 
other matters year conversion management believes conversion to a year compliant environment will not present a material consideration for the company s current operations 
the company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its computer software systems to programs which are year compliant 
the company does not anticipate that total future costs associated with potential year compliance issues will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position
