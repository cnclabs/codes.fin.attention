gulf canada is one of canada s largest independent producers of oil and natural gas  with operations in western canada  where the company has over years of experience in conventional oil and gas operations  and internationally with operations in indonesia  the north sea and australia 
gulf canada s executive offices are located at one norwest center  lincoln street  suite  denver  colorado   usa and its headquarters and registered office is located at th avenue sw  calgary  alberta tp h in  the company completed the following significant transactions the company completed its acquisition of clyde petroleum plc clyde for  million 
clyde s material assets were located in the north sea  indonesia and australia 
clyde s assets had average daily net sales of approximately mboe during december  and estimated net proved reserves of mmboe as of year end the company sold of western canadian assets during the year including the zama virgo producing property located in northern alberta for million cash plus the coleville property adjacent to gulf s coleville south heavy oil operations in saskatchewan 
proceeds were used primarily to repay indebtedness 
the company consolidated its indonesian assets into gulf indonesia resources limited 
in september  gulf indonesia was listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol grl  and an initial public offering of approximately per cent of the company s shares was completed 
gulf received net proceeds of million  which was primarily used to repay indebtedness 
the company acquired stampeder exploration ltd 
stampeder in august for total consideration of million  consisting of million cash and the remainder in gulf stock 
stampeder s assets were primarily heavy oil properties located in western canada 
stampeder s assets had average daily net sales in december of  boe and estimated net proved reserves of mmboe at december following the acquisition of stampeder  gulf formed the gulf heavy oil division gho to consolidate the acquisition and operation of its heavy oil assets 
as a consequence of its acquisition  exploration and development activities  gulf s estimated net proved oil and gas reserves increased per cent from mmboe on december  to mmboe on december   and average daily net production increased per cent from mboe d in to mboe in in early  gulf announced that it intended i to sell primarily non operated assets in the united kingdom area of the north sea and ii to form an infrastructure trust to hold certain of its mid stream assets in canada and sell interests in the trust in an initial public offering 
gulf also announced an intent to sell certain non core assets 
proceeds from these transactions will be used primarily to repay indebtedness 
on march   gulf announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with kerr mcgee corporation to sell the company s assets in the uk north sea for million 
general 
gulf was founded in  and operated as a fully integrated oil company until when the company sold its refining and marketing assets 
in  the company acquired asamera  inc  a predecessor to gulf indonesia resources limited  which has operations in indonesia 
during  the company further expanded its international operations primarily by acquiring clyde petroleum plc  which has operations in the north sea  indonesia and australia 
gulf is also a major producer of heavy oil and produces synthetic crude oil through its interest in syncrude 
the following table summarizes gulf s net sales of production and estimated net proved reserves as of and for the year ended december  average daily estimated net net sales proved reserves liquids gas liquids gas mb mmcf mboe mmb bcf mmboe north american conventional light oil natural gas  heavy oil other total north american conventional  international indonesia north sea australia other 

total international syncrude total  the reserves attributable to indonesia are owned by grl  a per cent owned subsidiary of gulf 
the amount of reserves represent per cent of the estimated net proved reserves owned by grl 
gulf has announced plans to sell certain of its north sea assets representing approximately per cent of the total north sea proved reserves 
syncrude s estimated net proved reserves are equal to the lesser of i the estimated reserves commercially recoverable from its leases approved for mining by applicable regulatory authorities with high geologic confidence based on core hole samples using current technology and ii the production for the most recent year multiplied by the number of years remaining on the syncrude project s license 
the amount of reserves recoverable from syncrude s existing leases greatly exceeds the amount of production during multiplied by the remaining term of the facility license 
the syncrude proved reserves are therefore equal to production multiplied by the remaining term on the syncrude license 
in conformance with the canadian norm  gulf has historically reported north american natural gas reserves converted to an oil equivalent at mcf barrel 
north america conventional production gulf s core areas in western canada are  and are expected to remain  the company s primary source of production through gulf s conventional oil production in western canada includes light and medium grades of oil api gravity of more than degree as well as heavy crude oil now managed by the gulf heavy oil division 
the purchase price for heavy oil is generally less than for light and medium grades of oil reflecting higher transportation and refining costs  reducing the profit margin and making heavy oil production more sensitive to changes in oil prices 
gulf is one of the most active drillers in western canada 
in  gulf drilled net wells  of which were successful  for a per cent success rate 
these included net exploration wells  of which were successful per cent  and development wells  of which were successful per cent 
of the total net wells drilled  gulf operated for an per cent success rate 
of the wells drilled in  net wells were natural gas reflecting gulf s objective to balance canadian oil and gas production 
gulf s drilling operations included net wells drilled as part of its heavy oil operations  per cent of which were successful 
all of these wells were drilled in the last four months of following gulf s acquisition of stampeder 
western canadian light oil and natural gas operations gulf canada light oil and natural gas operations include interests in over four million net acres of developed and undeveloped land in western canada 
as part of its business strategy  gulf forms alliances with other canadian producers to explore and develop the undeveloped land holdings 
during  gulf formed alliances with stellarton energy corporation and sequoia exploration and development to explore and develop non core properties and with northrock resources ltd 
northrock to lead an exploration effort in an area of mutual interest in west central alberta 
in early  gulf announced an alliance with merit energy ltd 
to explore and develop acreage near the saskatchewan border in southeast alberta 
gulf s western canadian light oil and natural gas operations produced approximately  boe d before royalties in from three main areas northern region 
gulf s northern region produced approximately  boe d during current production in the area is oil focused per cent on a boe basis  but a significant portion of current exploration and development is for natural gas 
the northern region includes properties in the swan hills area that contain long lived reserves and produce approximately  boe d of high quality light oil 
production in the area has increased in the last several years as a result of infill drilling and enhanced oil recovery operations 
light conventional assets from the stampeder acquisition expanded gulf s growing position in the red earth area 
this area  which includes the trout  senex  house creek and panny fields  produces approximately  boe d and provides gulf with more than sections of land to continue exploration and development in the area 
west central alberta region 
gulf s west central alberta region produced approximately  boe d in this has been a core oil and natural gas producing area for gulf for many years and includes such fields as caroline  strachan  brazeau  nordegg and pembina modeste 
the company has expanded its land base in this area  due to the potential of the multi zone natural gas formations 
during  gulf entered into a strategic alliance with northrock to explore and develop an area of mutual interest representing approximately per cent of gulf s gross land holdings in this region 
during  gulf expects to participate in wells in this area 
gulf also operates sizable mid stream natural gas gathering and processing facilities in this region 
these include major gas plants at rimbey  gilby  strachan  nordegg and brazeau  with total sour gas processing capacity of approximately bcf d 
this dominant position presents opportunities to maximize value through increased capacity utilization and third party processing revenues 
plains region 
in the plains region  located in southeastern alberta  gulf produced approximately  boe d of light oil and natural gas during  primarily from the westerose  gilby  fenn  ghost pine and richdale fields 
the company has been actively pursuing natural gas opportunities in this area with several multi well  shallow  natural gas exploitation drilling programs 
gulf controls production and processing facilities in the area and has numerous opportunities to increase both oil and natural gas production  including infill locations  enhanced recovery oil development and shallow gas development 
the alliance with merit energy ltd 
entered into in early extends gulf s reach to the saskatchewan border and is intended to accelerate exploration with a partner that has established exploration and development facilities and has a proven track record in the area 
the budget plans for include drilling more than wells in the area  to of which will be on gulf land 
exploration in addition to its established core areas  gulf is actively exploring new areas in northern alberta and british columbia 
key prospects in this area include steen  sikanni  south haro and musreau lake 
the company also explores two areas totaling  net acres in the united states 
in  gulf will drill two wells in fort peck  montana and conduct a d seismic program on its cotton valley prospects in east texas 
the company is negotiating to commence work on the million acres on which it holds exploration permits in the saint pierre and miquelon area 
gulf has identified prospects from existing seismic data and may participate in a  kilometer seismic data acquisition program planned for summer heavy oil operations subsequent to the acquisition of stampeder in september  gulf created the gulf heavy oil gho division to consolidate and focus the company s heavy oil activities 
this division has an industry leading technical team dedicated to optimizing production from a large and concentrated  high quality  heavy oil resource base 
gho also operates the surmont steam enhanced recovery pilot project in alberta 
gho began producing approximately  b d of heavy oil 
the operations are concentrated in two regions the central plains region located near coleville in west central saskatchewan and the northern plains region located near lloydminster on the alberta saskatchewan border 
the central plains region contributed approximately  b d of heavy oil including production from the main fields of coleville  coleville south and kerrobert 
the coleville kerrobert area currently produces from a combination of primary and secondary waterflood production 
gho commenced operation of a steam enhanced oil recovery project in the kerrobert field in late the cental plains region also includes a joint venture where gulf and a partner lease  gross acres 
at the beginning of the year  the joint venture contributed  b d net of heavy oil production 
the northern plains region was producing approximately  b d of heavy oil at the beginning of the main fields senlac  long lake and rutland collectively produce  gross b d 
in august  gulf commenced operation of a steam enhanced oil recovery pilot project at its surmont leases  in the athabasca tar sands near fort mcmurray  alberta 
the pilot will be used to test and prove methods of recovering bitumen using steam injection 
gulf s surmont leases contain more than billion barrels of bitumen  and the company estimates that more than two billion barrels can potentially be recovered with steam injection methods 
if surmont performs as expected  first production from a  b d commercial project could commence before the end of the year syncrude gulf holds a per cent interest in syncrude 
syncrude  with facilities near fort mcmurray  alberta  is the world s largest producer of synthetic crude oil from oil sands 
bitumen is mined  extracted and upgraded into a high quality  low sulphur  light crude oil known as syncrude sweet blend ssb  which receives a premium price relative to conventional light oil 
gulf s share of ssb production continued its steady growth  increasing from  b d in to  b d in ssb production is expected to increase to approximately  b d in  benefiting from completion of a coker debottleneck in april and the opening of a new mine train the mining and processing equipment required to recover  prepare and transport ore for extraction at the north mine in september syncrude s net operating income increased per cent from  the fourth consecutive year of earnings growth 
crown royalties paid in connection with syncrude were significantly lower in  as a result of a per cent increase in capital expenditures and a new oil sands royalty regime introduced at the beginning of the year 
the new royalty regime provides a direct incentive for increased capital investment in oil sands projects 
in november  syncrude released its business plan 
with approximately billion barrels of bitumen under lease and recoverable with current technology plus incentives provided by the new royalty regime  the plan proposes to double syncrude production over the next ten years 
the plan  which will require capital expenditures of approximately billion dollars million net to gulf over the next years  provides for a four stage expansion to increase production capacity from million barrels per year in to million barrels per year or  b d net to gulf by three new mining trains and associated extraction facilities will be opened on further the aurora north leases  kilometers north of the existing mine and plant site 
the plan also calls for further debottlenecking of the existing upgrading facilities and the installation of a third coker 
in  gulf formed the athabasca oil sands trust  and consummated an initial public offering of units of beneficial interest in the trust 
the trust acquired an per cent interest in syncrude from the alberta government 
gulf continues to provide administrative services to the athabasca oil sands trust and markets the trust s share of syncrude production 
indonesia in october  gulf completed a successful public offering of nearly per cent of gulf indonesia resources limited grl  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of gulf 
grl s ordinary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol grl 
during  grl significantly increased the size of its indonesia land base  adding almost million gross offshore acres and establishing two new core areas 
early in  grl acquired clyde petroleum s interest in the kakap psc  located offshore sumatra in the west natuna sea  and the halmahera psc  located offshore from halmahera island in eastern indonesia 
subsequently  grl acquired two new blocks in the west natuna sea to complement kakap as well as interests in three exploration blocks offshore from java 
gulf indonesia s production averaged  b d in from fields located in on shore sumatra and in the west natuna sea offshore sumatra 
grl s operations are conducted through contractual arrangements with pertamina in the form of production sharing contracts psc  one technical assistance contract and one enhanced oil recovery contract 
under these arrangements  grl and its partners provide financing and technical expertise to conduct exploration  development and production operations in a specified geologic area each a contract area 
five contract areas currently produce oil  four of which are located on shore sumatra  and one of which is located in the west natuna sea 
grl s on shore oil properties produced  b d in december on shore production is transported by pipeline to a refinery 
the pipeline and refinery are owned by the indonesian state oil company  and all of the company s oil production is sold to the state oil company for prices based on various postings in the area 
grl s off shore production is from wells in eight fields and produced  b d in december grl operates four production platforms in the area with initial processing facilities that are linked by pipelines to a floating production  storage and off loading vessel with a  barrel capacity 
offshore production is sold in the spot market 
grl continues to develop the corridor block gas project 
this project contemplates the development of grl s natural gas reserves in central sumatra  transportation of the gas through the trans central sumatra pipeline to the duri steamflood oil fields in northern sumatra 
corridor project natural gas production will be used to power the steamflood equipment operating at the duri steamflood to recover oil 
the company will exchange its natural gas production for oil produced from the duri steamflood on a energy equivalent basis 
grl has entered into contracts to transport and sell the oil it receives in exchange for its gas production 
the corridor block gas project is currently in the construction phase and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of grl is developing the corridor block fields  including drilling development and exploration wells  constructing a gas processing plant and related gas gathering and de watering facilities 
the trans central sumatra pipeline is owned and construction is managed by pgn  the indonesian state pipeline agency 
exploration grl had a number of exploration successes in late  during and in early in late  grl drilled a gas exploration well in the south jambi b psc  located north of the corridor block area 
this well was a discovery  penetrating almost meters feet of net pay and flowing at a cumulative rate of mmcf d with a per cent co content 
subsequently  during grl focused on discovering sufficient reserves required to develop a commercial project 
efforts proved successful with significant discoveries at rayun and bungin 
preliminary estimates of potential gross recoverable sales gas reserves fall within a range that would support a mmcf d natural gas project 
grl drilled an exploration well in the tungkal psc in the corridor block area which tested mb d of oil and mmcf d of natural gas from two zones 
based upon these results and a d seismic program completed in the fourth quarter  grl intends to drill two more delineation wells in mid grl also plans to drill another oil prospect ten kilometers south of mengeopeh 
on the kakap psc located offshore in the west natuna sea  the company drilled a successful exploration well in the nelayan field  and has begun a six well exploration drilling program underway to test oil and natural gas prospects on the block 
services agreements 
in connection with the initial public offering of grl  the company and grl entered into a number of agreements under which the material provisions are described below 
each of these agreements has been filed as an exhibit to the company s form k and the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements

north sea the company completed the acquisition of clyde petroleum plc in the first quarter of clyde s petroleum s north sea operations were producing approximately per cent of its sales volumes when it was acquired by gulf 
the acquisition gave gulf a new operating area in the north sea 
united kingdom as announced in february and in march  gulf intends to divest its uk assets  including interests in four producing oil fields  two projects currently under development and offshore onshore exploration licenses for million 
uk oil production  mainly from non operated interests in the wytch farm  gryphon and andrew fields  averaged  b d in  accounting for approximately nine per cent of gulf s total production 
the two development projects are the non operated ross field in which gulf has a per cent working interest and the leadon project in which gulf has a per cent working interest 
the netherlands the netherlands north sea operations are focused on three core operating areas comprising about million gross acres 
gulf operates shallow water offshore licenses and three onshore licenses that contributed approximately mmcf d of production net to gulf in production from the ke field in which gulf owns a per cent working interest began in november  which offset production declines in existing fields 
gulf s assets in the region are the result of a consolidation of three companies with ten years experience in the area 
the netherlands staff successfully acquired acreage in early north sea licensing rounds which are generally more favorable than more recent licenses and has significant control of infrastructure that together form a solid platform for satellite developments 
capital expenditures during the year were focused primarily on development of the p quadrant area to evaluate commerciality of the reservoir in which gulf owns a per cent working interest 
a horizontal well was spudded in december in this area and is currently testing in the pa se field 
following evaluation of the well  another horizontal well may be drilled in the second quarter of gulf acquired the gcd exploration license in which gulf has a per cent working interest 
this license is located offshore some kilometers north of amsterdam and contains a substantial triassic prospect 
gulf has acquired a square kilometer d seismic survey early in to identify drilling targets 
the company also acquired an interest in the gas rights in the k l blocks an average per cent working interest and plans to drill a horizontal well in to evaluate commerciality of the reservoir 
gulf and its predecessors have a per cent exploration success rate over the past ten years and has developed a five year exploration inventory of operated and non operated prospects 
australia gulf s principal assets in australia consist of two core areas  production of  boe d from the cooper basin unit area in which gulf owns a working interest in central australia and exploration in the bonaparte basin north west shelf region where gulf has acquired a contiguous land position 
in addition to these core areas  gulf has a land position in the carnarvon  otway and gippsland basins  offshore australia 
the company expects to spend one third of its australia capital budget on exploration and development in the cooper basin  one third on non cooper basin exploration  and the balance on seismic and appraisal drilling 
gulf currently holds exploration permits in australia covering million gross  or million net acres 
onshore 
the cooper basin in central australia comprises approximately million acres of which gulf has a working interest 
the land straddles the border between the states of south australia and south west queensland 
in addition to production of gas  ethane  condensate and lpg  the joint venture has undertaken a significant exploration initiative throughout in  gulf participated in a total of exploration wells in the cooper basin with a success ratio of 
the reserves addition from this activity added approximately million barrels of oil equivalent of proven and probable reserves 
this level of activity is expected to continue throughout offshore 
gulf has focussed its exploration activities towards the highly prolific bonaparte basin offshore northwest australia where it has an interest in almost two million gross acres  net acres 
in  gulf s first discovery was made in the region with the drilling of tenacious on the ac p permit operated by cultus petroleum  gulf working interest work is progressing on appraisal and development plans for this discovery 
tenacious was a significant discovery for the region as it proved up a new horizon known as the tithonian and flowed  b d  which was a record for the region 
the adjacent permit operator plans to drill the first delineation well on the tenacious structure during second quarter if this well is successful  a second appraisal well could be drilled on ac p in which the company has a working interest pending rig availability 
the ac p joint venture has begun discussions with the operator of the nearby fpso with regard to the technical and commercial aspects of producing and selling tenacious oil via that facility  which is only kilometers away 
initial tenacious production is targeted for mid the company is participating in a multi client  square kilometer d survey on permits ac p  in the bonaparte basin and a  kilometer d program in ac p  and data from these programs will form a key component of exploration in this core area 
gulf expects the partner operated brontosaurus working interest on ac p to spud in late or early the well is located kilometers west of the jabiru oil field and related infrastructure 
risk factors volatility of oil and natural gas prices gulf canada s results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the prices received for its oil and natural gas production 
the company s ability to arrange financing and acquire the capital necessary to explore and develop its properties is also dependent on the price of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated widely during recent years and are determined by supply and demand factors  including weather and general economic conditions  as well as conditions in other oil producing regions  which are beyond the control of gulf canada 
any decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on gulf canada s operations  financial condition  proved reserves and the level of expenditures for the development of its oil and natural gas reserves 
no assurance can be given that oil and natural gas prices will be at levels which will generate profits for gulf canada 
in addition  gulf canada regularly assesses the carrying value of its assets in accordance with canadian gaap and us gaap under the successful efforts method 
see the consolidated financial statements included herein 
if oil and natural gas prices become depressed or decline  the carrying value of gulf canada s assets could be subject to downward revision 
during the first quarter of  oil prices have been low compared to prices received in the last five years 
continued low oil prices could have a material adverse affect on gulf 
need to replace reserves gulf canada s future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore its cash flows  are highly dependent upon gulf canada s success in exploiting its current reserve base and acquiring or discovering additional reserves 
without reserve additions through exploration  acquisition or development activities  gulf canada s reserves and production will decline over time as reserves are produced 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
to the extent cash flows from operations are insufficient and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable  the company s ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain and expand its oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired 
in addition  there can be no assurance that gulf canada will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves to replace production at acceptable costs 
leverage gulf canada s debt instruments impose restrictions on the operations and activities of gulf canada 
generally  the most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence  investments  capital expenditures  sales of assets and the use of proceeds therefrom and cash distributions by gulf canada and require gulf canada to comply with certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of a debt to total capitalization ratio 
the ability of gulf canada to comply with the foregoing restrictions and covenants will be dependent upon its future performance and various other factors  including factors beyond gulf canada s control 
a failure to comply with these restrictions or covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument  which could cause acceleration of the debt under such instrument and other instruments that contain cross default provisions 
operating hazards and other uncertainties acquiring  developing and exploring for oil and natural gas involves many risks 
these risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures  premature declines of reservoirs  blow outs  equipment failures and other accidents  craterings  sour gas releases  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  adverse weather conditions  pollution  other environmental risks  fires and spills 
although gulf canada maintains insurance in accordance with customary industry practice  gulf canada is not fully insured against all of these risks 
losses resulting from the occurrence of these risks could have a material adverse impact on gulf canada 
gulf canada  like other international oil companies  attempts to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where it operates  but there can be no assurance that gulf canada will be successful in so protecting itself 
gulf canada is also subject to deliverability uncertainties related to the proximity of its reserves to pipeline and processing facilities and the inability to secure space on pipelines which deliver oil and natural gas to commercial markets 
uncertainty of reserve estimates there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of gulf canada 
the reserve data set forth herein represent estimates only 
in general  estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the properties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative  and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for those reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties  classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
gulf canada s actual production  revenues  taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from such estimates  and such variances could be material 
estimates with respect to proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations  which may be substantial  in the estimated reserves 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the us securities and exchange commission sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate unless such prices or costs are contractually determined at such date 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers  changes in governmental regulation or taxation and the impact of inflation on costs 
the securities disclosure legislation and policies of canada  as interpreted by the securities commissions in canada  permit the use of escalated prices and costs in calculating reserve quantities  which is not permitted for disclosure of reserve quantities in financial statements filed with the sec 
reserves set forth in financial statements filed with the sec must be based on period end prices and costs  without escalation  except where required by contract 
additionally  canadian legislation and policies permit the disclosure of probable reserves which may not be disclosed in financial statements filed with the sec 
probable reserves are generally believed to be less likely to be recovered than proved reserves 
the reserve estimates included herein could be materially different from the quantities and values ultimately realized 
environmental risks all phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of international conventions and canadian and us federal  provincial  state and municipal laws and regulations 
environmental legislation provides for  among other things  restrictions and prohibitions on spills  releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with gulf canada s past and current operations 
the legislation also requires that refineries  service stations  wells and facility sites be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  some of which may be material 
in addition  certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
gulf canada  either directly or through subsidiaries  owned numerous refineries  service stations and related operations in canada and the united states prior to  and continues to hold former sites  which have given rise to some claims and could give rise to additional claims in the future under laws that provide that responsible parties can include present and prior owners  operators and others  including claims for investigation  clean up and restoration costs and damages for personal injury 
although gulf canada believes that it is currently in substantial compliance with all existing material environmental regulations  there can be no assurance that future environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on gulf canada s financial condition or result of operations 
competition there is strong competition relating to all aspects of the oil and gas industry  in particular the exploration for and development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
gulf canada actively competes for reserve acquisitions  exploration leases  licenses and concessions and skilled industry personnel with a substantial number of other oil and gas companies  many of which have significantly greater financial resources than gulf canada 
gulf canada s competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and numerous other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators 
governmental regulation the petroleum industry is particularly subject to regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as the awarding of exploration and production interests  the imposition of specific drilling obligations  environmental protection controls  control over the development and abandonment of fields including restrictions on production and possibly expropriation or cancellation of contract rights  as well as with respect to prices  taxes  royalties and the exportation of oil and natural gas 
such regulation may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions 
the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas and crude oil  increase gulf canada s costs and have a material adverse impact on gulf canada 
exchange rate fluctuations gulf canada is exposed to foreign exchange risks since the majority of its revenue is received in or by reference to us dollar denominated prices while the majority of its expenditures are in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has varied substantially in the last five years

item properties reserves the following table describes the company s estimated net proved reserves as of the end of each of the last three years estimated net proved reserves oil and natural gas liquids mmb natural gas bcf    mmboe present value of future net cash flows discounted at millions of dollars    the company s internal staff of reserve engineers prepared the estimates of proven reserves of the company 
reserves were estimated using oil and gas prices and production and development costs in effect on december of each year  without escalation  and were otherwise prepared in accordance with the commission regulations regarding disclosure of oil and gas reserve information 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of the company and the reserve engineers 
the reserve data set forth in this document represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors  such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors  such as an increase or decrease in product prices that renders production of such reserves more or less economic  may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates are different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
see risk factors uncertainty of reserve estimates 
oil and gas drilling activities during the five years ended december   approximately per cent of the company s net wells drilled were in western canada 
as a result of gulf canada s increased capital expenditures during through  drilling activity increased from previous years 
in  gulf canada had drilling success rates of per cent for gross per cent net exploration wells and per cent for gross per cent net development wells 
the following table sets forth the gross and net number of productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells drilled from through for the company as a whole 
gross means all wells in which gulf canada has an interest and net means gross wells after deducting interests of others

developed acreage refers to the acreage to which the company has assigned proved reserves 
undeveloped acreage refers to the acreage to which the company has not assigned any proved reserves 
the table does not include approximately  gross acres in which royalty interests are held 
title to properties oil and gas rights in western canada are held primarily by the provinces but may also be privately owned 
on provincially owned lands  the two main types of rights agreements are licenses and leases 
licenses define the boundaries of an exploration area and the work required to maintain good standing 
satisfying the license requirements entitles the holder to convert all or a portion of the license rights to lease form 
leases accommodate exploration  development and production activities 
the lessee of a lease is generally responsible for paying all development and operating costs and is entitled to the production subject to a rental and royalty payable to the lessor 
leases are also granted by private owners of mineral rights for varying terms 
both provincial and private leases are generally maintained by production or productive capability 
most of gulf canada s interests in frontier lands are held under significant discovery licenses pursuant to the canada petroleum resources act canada cpra 
in the amauligak area of the beaufort sea  gulf canada s interest is held under a production license  subject to the cpra 
interests issued in the east coast offshore are adjacent to the province of newfoundland and are subject to the canada newfoundland atlantic accord implementation act 
the east coast offshore interests include million gross and million net acres in the st 
pierre bank and banquereau areas that are presently under development moratorium 
there is continuing negotiation over provincial jurisdiction between newfoundland and nova scotia and the lands will remain in moratorium until this matter is settled 
the company s land interests in indonesia are owned by grl 
these interests are held subject to production sharing contracts  a technical assistance contract and an enhanced oil recovery contract  under which the grl and the other contracting companies are eligible to recover their capital and operated costs from production if a commercial discovery is made 
any balance of production is divided in varying shares between the government of the producing country  or its state owned oil corporation  and the contracting companies 
interests in the uk north sea are held under licenses issued by the united kingdom department of trade and industry 
the netherlands north sea licenses are issued by the netherlands government 
in australia  the company s land interests both onshore and offshore consist of interests in production licenses  exploration permits and retention leases issued under the petroleum submerged lands act commonwealth or state  as appropriate 
interests held in the zone of cooperation which is administered by the joint authority established by the australian and indonesian governments consist of production sharing contracts approved by the joint authority 
the relationships amongst the parties are governed through joint venture operating agreements  which are permit specific 
gulf holds its interest in land through either a trust relationship with the operator or by being a registered title holder on the relevant permit 
gas plants and pipelines gulf canada s business includes the acquisition  ownership and operation of assets which generate cash flow and that are non depleting  such as gas processing plants  pipelines and gathering systems 
as at december   gulf canada operated six major natural gas plants with total gross processing capacity of approximately  mmcf d and operates another ten plants and has interests in numerous other non operating gas plants 
gulf canada markets unused plant capacity to third parties  and attempts to acquire natural gas properties and exploit existing natural gas properties adjacent to these plants 
gulf canada has interests in two pipeline systems the rimbey pipeline  in which it has a per cent interest  and the wabasca river pipeline  in which it has a per cent interest 
the rimbey pipeline carries propane  butane and condensate to edmonton for subsequent redistribution at a rate of mbbls d 
the wabasca river pipeline carries to mbbls d of crude oil from the senex  trout mountain  kidney and panny fields in alberta to the rainbow pipeline 
gulf canada operates both pipeline systems from its control center in edmonton  alberta 
the corporation is also the operator of three natural gas liquids product pipelines operating between the fort saskatchewan  alberta liquids fractionation and storage plant and edmonton 
gulf canada has a per cent interest in the fort saskatchewan facilities 
gulf canada is considering an infrastructure trust arrangement and is currently reviewing these assets for that purpose 
other facilities and operations coal 
although gulf canada is not currently engaged in commercial production of coal  it continues to hold some coal properties 
the corporation s most significant coal property is mount klappan in british columbia where drilling has confirmed a substantial anthracite deposit 
gulf canada has announced that it plans to divest of the mount klappan coal property 
marketing the marketing of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas is an integral part of gulf canada s business 
gulf canada continues to grow marketing capabilities and third party volumes as a way to provide flexibility and lower cost services for gulf canada s increasing liquids and gas volumes 
during  petro canada and shell canada limited accounted for per cent and per cent respectively  of oil and gas revenues of the company 
the company had no other purchasers that accounted for greater than per cent of its oil and gas revenues 
the company believes that the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company 
crude oil 
in  gulf canada was selected as one of three companies to market the province of alberta s crown royalty crude oil volumes 
the province s  b d of light sweet crude  combined with other third party and gulf canada s own volumes  brought total volumes marketed by gulf canada  including a portion of ssb from the syncrude facility  to over  bbls d 
as a result of gulf canada s marketing arrangement with athabasca  gulf canada has agreed to market the synthetic crude oil production attributable to the per cent interest in syncrude recently acquired by athabasca  representing approximately mbbls d 
during  per cent and per cent of gulf canada s crude oil production from western canada including synthetic crude oil was marketed directly to refiners in canada and the united states  respectively  on terms negotiated with each buyer 
gulf is a shareholder in a new corporation  tidal energy marketing inc  formed to carry on crude oil marketing business 
tidal is marketing gulf s crude oil pursuant to an arrangement effective january  in indonesia  the corporation s crude oil production  which averaged  mbbls d in and represented approximately per cent of the corporation s consolidated gross revenues  is sold to pertamina  the indonesian state owned oil company as well as directly to offshore markets 
the price received for the crude oil is determined monthly by the indonesian government based on a weighted average of benchmark world crude oil prices 
natural gas liquids 
gulf canada is a major marketer of natural gas liquids  consisting of ethane  propane and butane 
these natural gas liquids are extracted from natural gas processed at various field plants 
the corporation also fractionates  stores and sells natural gas liquids at an underground storage facility at fort saskatchewan  alberta  in which gulf canada holds a per cent interest 
the natural gas liquid products are delivered to market through various pipelines  storage and loading facilities  tank trucks and a leased  gulf canada operated  rail tank car fleet 
in  gulf canada marketed approximately mb d of natural gas liquids  approximately per cent of which represents third party volumes 
natural gas 
sales of natural gas averaged mmcf d in compared to mmcf d for approximately per cent of gulf canada s natural gas sales in were pursuant to long term contracts with alberta gas purchasers known as aggregators who resell the gas in both domestic and export markets 
the remaining natural gas sales were direct sales to local distribution companies  industrial customers and marketing companies 
segment information 
reference is made to note entitled segment information under the heading notes to consolidated financial statements of the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended december business environment competitive and industry conditions 
there is strong competition relating to all aspects of the oil and gas industry  and in particular in the exploration and development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to extensive government regulation relating to prices  taxes  royalties  land tenure  allowable production  the export of oil and natural gas and many other aspects 
gulf canada s production is subject to deliverability uncertainties related to the proximity of its reserves to pipeline and processing facilities  and shipping restrictions on pipelines that deliver oil and natural gas to commercial markets 
future production from frontier lands will depend upon  among other factors  satisfactory fiscal and regulatory terms  oil prices  the establishment of sufficient reserves to justify the substantial capital costs of production facilities and the development of transportation systems to bring such reserves to market 
the business environment also exposes gulf canada to a number of risks  including those associated with fluctuations in oil prices and exchange rates  uncertainties in estimates of reserves  risks arising from active oil and gas exploration and development activities  and the potential for environmental clean up obligations and liabilities arising from its current or past operations 
the corporation endeavors to carry on its business in such a manner as to minimize such risks 
environmental protection 
the operations of gulf canada are  and will continue to be  affected in varying degrees by laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment 
it is impossible to predict the full impact of these laws and regulations on gulf canada s operations 
however  it is not anticipated that gulf canada s competitive position will be adversely affected by current or future environmental laws and regulations governing its current oil and gas operations 
since  gulf canada has implemented a program of regular environmental audits to review operating practices and procedures at major plants and facilities in western canada and to provide for compliance with regulatory requirements 
in addition  acquisitions and divestitures are subject to environmental audits 
gulf canada s accounting policy is to provide for future site restoration costs  including dismantling plants and abandoning properties  using the unit of production method or  where appropriate  the estimated remaining useful lives of the related assets 
gulf canada has accrued million for such future costs at december  total anticipated future costs  given gulf canada s current inventory of wells and facilities  including those relating to syncrude  is estimated to be approximately million over the next years 
gulf canada also has environmental obligations related to certain mineral operations for which it has recorded a provision 
in addition to its environmental responsibility for current operations  gulf canada is or may be responsible for future environmental costs related to certain past operations  mainly downstream in nature 
foreign operations 
some of gulf canada s reserves and operations outside canada and those acquired in through the acquisition of control of clyde are located in regions that may be considered politically and economically unstable 
these reserves and the related operations are subject to certain risks  including increases in taxes and royalties  the establishment of production limits  export restrictions  the involuntary renegotiation of contracts  the nationalization of assets  other risks relating to changes in local government regimes and policies and resulting changes in business customs and practices  payment delays  currency exchange restrictions and losses and impairment of operations by actions of insurgent groups 
gulf canada  like other international oil companies  attempts to conduct its business and financial affairs in such a manner as to protect against such political and economic risks 
gulf canada reduces risk associated with foreign projects through farmouts  phased development programs and project financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that gulf canada will be successful in protecting itself from the risks presented by foreign operations 
general employees 
as of december   gulf canada employed  regular employees 
item legal proceedings gulf is involved in various litigation  regulatory and other environmental matters in the ordinary course of business

earnings of million contrast with a loss of million  which is mainly attributable to volume growth and improved commodity prices in over during  gulf spent billion acquiring clyde petroleum plc and stampeder exploration ltd 
with the acquisition of clyde  gulf emerged as a truly international company  complementing existing operations in indonesia and expanding into the united kingdom  the netherlands and australia 
the acquisition of clyde also added considerable international exploration opportunities 
the purchase of stampeder augmented gulf s historically strong position in heavy oil 
these transactions added significant production capability  reflected in the substantial increase in gulf s sales volumes totaling  boe d in  up per cent from  boe d in volumes increased per cent from levels of  boe d  reflecting the effect of the pennzoil canada inc and mannville oil and gas ltd 
acquisitions and increased capital expenditures 
in addition to funding acquisitions  cash generated from operations was used to fund capital and exploration activity of billion in  up per cent over spending 
north american conventional oil and gas operations accounted for million of the spending 
in addition  gulf spent million on syncrude  million on thermal projects  million on infrastructure assets  million in indonesia  million on other international projects and million on marketing and other corporate expenditures 
spending of million represented a million increase over capital and exploration activity of million  mainly due to a higher level of drilling activity and spending on the corridor block gas project 
during  gulf made substantial progress in refinancing the debt incurred through the acquisition of clyde and stampeder 
a successful offering of million shares resulted in net proceeds of million  and an offering of year term senior notes yielded net proceeds of million 
in addition  approximately million of new equity was issued to purchase stampeder 
the on going divestment of non core western canada oil and gas assets yielded proceeds of million in in addition  a major event occurred in october when net proceeds of us million were received from the public offering of percent of the shares of gulf indonesia resources limited 
gulf indonesia is listed on the new york stock exchange 
during  gulf received proceeds of million through a public issue of gulf common stock  acquired most of pennzoil canada inc s western canada assets for net cash consideration of million  and issued us million of senior notes due in results from operations traditionally  gulf has reported its year to year operations in three business segments western canada conventional  oil sands and international 
in this report  an additional segment has been added to present gulf indonesia separately 
in addition  the western canada operations have been restated to reflect north american performance with the exception of the syncrude operations which are presented separately due to the unique nature of their operations 
north america oil gas cash generated by north american production was million in  virtually unchanged from a million increase attributable to the acquisition of stampeder in august was offset by a decline in revenue as a result of asset divestitures 
cash generated from operations of million increased million from levels mainly due to higher sales volumes and commodity prices in net operating income declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of asset divestitures  lower crude oil prices  increased exploration activity  and a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization charge 
net operating income almost doubled to million from million in for the reasons stated above 
net oil and gas revenues  excluding the effect of hedging  increased by million to million 
the acquisition of stampeder contributed million and an per mcf increase in average natural gas prices contributed million 
these increases were primarily offset by a mmcf d decrease in average year over year gas volumes due to asset sales resulting in a million decrease and a per barrel decline in the average realized price of crude oil in accounting for a million decrease 
net oil and gas revenues of million increased million from million in higher commodity prices  with a per barrel increase in the average realized liquids price and per mcf increase in the average natural gas price  accounted for the majority of the increase  with the balance largely due to increased volumes 
production costs increased million to million in  mainly attributable to stampeder operations 
costs per unit of production increased by per boe  which largely reflects the acquisitions 
a significant proportion of high cost properties were sold near the end of production costs of million increased over costs of million as a result of an unusual amount of one time costs relating to production enhancements and as a result of the growth of production due to acquisitions and other capital spending 
acquisitions and the write down of certain unproductive properties caused depreciation  depletion and amortization expense to increase to million in compared with million in and million in exploration expenses increased to million in from million in  attributable on an approximately equal basis to dryhole and seismic costs 
exploration expenses increased million over costs of million 
total capital and exploration expenditures for north america conventional oil and gas operations were million in  million in and million in expenditures on thermal projects  comprising gulf s activities in the development of steam assisted oil recovery operations in the surmont and kerrobert areas  increased to million in from million in spending of million on the surmont project included drilling four horizontal wells  installing new surface facilities and delineation drilling for commercial development 
expenditures of million on the kerrobert project in the four months after the acquisition of stampeder resulted in the completion of the main steam facilities

cash generated from operations has followed a similar trend  increasing to million in from million in and million in net revenues from syncrude were million in compared to million in  a nine per cent improvement 
crown royalties were significantly lower than the previous year as a result of the effect of a per cent increase in capital expenditures and a new oil sands royalty regime  implemented on january  net revenues of million increased million over net revenues of million largely attributable to a per barrel price improvement 
syncrude experienced another record production year  with gulf s share of sales volumes increasing to  b d in from  b d in as a result of the opening of a new mining train in the north mine and a higher bitumen conversion yield 
partially offsetting this increase in net revenues was a per barrel decline in prices in volumes remained virtually unchanged at  b d from levels of  b d

the indonesian segment consists of onshore operations  which are mainly focused on the island of sumatra  and offshore operations located in the west natuna sea 
cash generated from operations of million increased million from  reflecting in large part the impact of the company s february acquisition of clyde petroleum plc s indonesian asset  the kakap production sharing contract psc in the west natuna sea 
cash generated from operations of million increased million from million in due to higher revenues resulting from improved crude prices in net operating income of million was unchanged from the prior year 
the kakap psc acquisition contributed million in earnings in  which was offset by higher dry hole write offs associated with indonesia s increased exploration program 
net operating income of million increased million from due mainly to higher net revenues 
net oil revenue for was million compared to million for the same period last year  a million increase 
the kakap psc accounted for the majority of the increase 
net revenue from onshore operations remained relatively flat year over year as reduced government take was offset by a per barrel decline in the average realized crude oil price 
net oil revenues increased million compared to net oil revenues of million  due to an improvement in the average sales price per barrel 
operating expenses for fell to per barrel million from per barrel million in  largely as a result of the addition of lower cost production from the kakap psc 
as well  operating expenses for onshore operations reflect the impact of additional workover activity to maintain production levels 
operating expenses remained consistent between and at million 
exploration expenses increased million to million for due to the increased level of activity in the company drilled exploration wells in compared with five wells in of the total exploration wells drilled  five exploratory wells were dry in and two were dry in exploration expenses decreased by million from million in capital expenditures and exploration expenses significantly increased from million in to million in during  gulf incurred approximately million associated with the construction of the corridor block gas project  compared to approximately million in as well  included million of capital expenditures and exploration expenses related to the kakap psc 
expenditures of million increased from million in mainly due to the corridor block gas project 
during the latter part of and into  indonesia s economy suffered severe setbacks 
one of the factors that precipitated this situation was a decline in value of the indonesian rupiah against the us dollar 
these currency fluctuations are not expected to have a material long term impact on gulf s financial position as all current revenues are us dollar denominated  all major contracts entered into are in us dollars and rupiah denominated expenses are limited to approximately per cent of the company s overall expenditure profile

capital expenditures and exploration expenses millions of dollars canada conventional oil and gas syncrude united states indonesia other international corporate and other includes cost of injectants risk management foreign exchange gulf s results from operations are affected by the canadian us dollar exchange rate 
prices for substantially all of gulf s western canada oil production and approximately per cent of its natural gas production are us dollar denominated  while most of its expenses with the exception of international operations and interest costs on us dollar denominated debt  are denominated in canadian dollars 
accordingly  a decline in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has the effect of increasing revenues relative to expenses  although such a reduction in the relative value of the canadian dollar results in unrealized foreign exchange losses on gulf s us dollar denominated debt 
to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on revenues  gulf attempts to hedge its us dollar exposure in two ways 
first  it seeks to incur its debt in us dollars 
second  it undertakes forward sales of us dollars into canadian dollars 
as of february   gulf had entered into forward contracts to exchange us million in  us million in  us million in and us million in for canadian dollars at exchange rates between us and us  with an average rate of approximately us 
both of these strategies offer benefits to the company in the event of a decline in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar by decreasing its canadian dollar equivalent cost of debt service obligations and by creating a gain on the forward sales of us dollars 
these benefits partially offset any decline in revenues resulting from such devaluation of the us dollar 
conversely  these strategies will partially offset any increase in revenues that the company would derive from a stronger us dollar 
because the us dollar has strengthened relative to the canadian dollar since much of the company s debt was incurred  gulf has experienced unrealized foreign exchange losses that have partially offset the beneficial impact of the us dollar s appreciation on its revenues 
as at december   the canadian dollar equivalent of gulf s us dollar denominated debt had increased by million since the debt was incurred 
under canadian gaap  million million after tax of this increase had been amortized against earnings as of december   leaving a million balance million after tax which will be amortized over the remaining term of the debt 
under us gaap the full amount would have been charged to earnings 
commodity price gulf s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and natural gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and natural gas 
the prices received for a substantial portion of the company s oil and natural gas liquids are related to the spot price of wti crude oil 
oil and natural gas prices have been and  in the future  are expected to remain volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of economic factors 
during  prices for natural gas production in canada and the united states were higher than those prevailing during however  prices for western canada natural gas production were low during relative to prices for natural gas in certain us markets due to export pipeline constraints and related over supply in western canada 
gulf maintains active risk management programs to mitigate the financial impacts of fluctuating commodity prices  providing protection against falling commodity prices while retaining some upside potential 
as of december   the company had sold forward  b d of liquids production in at an average minimum price of us and a maximum price of us and approximately mmcf d of gas production at an average plant gate price of approximately c per mcf assuming a u 
s canadian dollar exchange rate of us 
these prices were achieved using a combination of physical sales and financial forward sales and options 
in addition  gulf has fixed the basis differential through gas aggregator sales  direct physical sales and the use of financial transactions between henry hub  louisiana the pricing location used by the new york mercantile exchange and alberta nova inventory transfer on approximately mmcf d at an average level of approximately us discount per million british thermal units btu 
in february  gulf entered into a swap transaction to fix the price on  b d of oil production at us during the last six months of gulf s board of directors has authorized commodity trading activities  provided that the company s total risk of loss shall not exceed million at any time 
the authorities include limits on both the number of uncovered cumulative positions and maximum dollar loss amounts 
control is maintained through the separation of trading and accounting functions as well as through daily mark to market reporting 
gulf has not engaged in any significant speculative foreign exchange or commodity price transactions 
year on january  many of the world s date sensitive computer systems could begin to fail due to programming that may lead them to read as this issue  commonly referred to as year or yk is gaining prominence as the new millennium approaches 
gulf believes its greatest vulnerability lies in its operating and control systems throughout its worldwide operations and with certain external service providers 
in addition  gulf believes that the year is a global issue that requires a cross industry focus 
during  gulf established a task force to assess and implement required changes 
the task force developed a plan that will be implemented in quarterly phases throughout to ensure that all gulf companies will continue to operate into and beyond gulf expects that it will determine the timing  costs and resources required by the end of the second quarter 
gulf believes there is sufficient preparedness planning under way to ensure that the year will not impact gulf s business materially 
sensitivities based on current production  price estimates and current hedge positions  the estimated effect on the company s financial results for of a change in the following factors is set out below cash generated from continuing operations millions of dollars production volumes oil and liquids  b d natural gas mmcf d prices wti oil us per bbl natural gas canada c per mcf exchange rate us c one cent interest rate per cent the impact of hedging contracts in place at february  has been included 
the effect on cash flow is mitigated by capitalization of interest associated with the corridor block gas project
