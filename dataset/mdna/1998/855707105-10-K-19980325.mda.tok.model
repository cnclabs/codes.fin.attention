the company is required to notify the insurance subsidiaries respective state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary commissioner of each insurer subsidiary has the authority to limit a non extraordinary dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted risk based capital requirements for property and casualty insurers effective december  risk based capital is a formula that attempts to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy and other business factors 
applying the risk based capital requirements as of december   each of the state auto insurance companies exceeded all standards tested by the formula 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs used by state auto financial and mutual and their respective subsidiaries all of which are collectively  referred to as state auto for the purposes of this section that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of uncertain duration in state auto s operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on an analysis of its systems software  management determined that it is required to modify or replace significant portions of state auto s software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
management presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operational problems for state auto 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could adversely affect the operations of state auto 
to address the year issue in a timely and effective manner  management purchased software from a third party vendor to assist in diagnosing and correcting certain of state auto s major policy processing software systems 
in addition  management is utilizing state auto s internal resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the balance of its software for necessary year modifications 
management presently anticipates completing the year modifications on state auto s critical business applications software by october and its remaining non critical business applications software during management expects to have these changes completed prior to the year issue having an adverse impact on state auto s operations and operating systems 
the total cost of the year project for state auto financial is estimated at million and is being funded through cash flows 
to date  state auto financial s incurred cost is approximately million and approximately of state auto s computer programs lines of code are year compliant 
also  management has initiated communications with all of state auto s significant suppliers and business partners to determine the extent to which state auto s interface systems are vulnerable to such third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
state auto financial s estimate of its total year project cost and its dates of completion include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues  based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the software systems of other companies on which state auto s computer systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on state auto 
also  engaging in the property casualty insurance business presents an additional exposure to financial losses for state auto financial 
there is a significant amount of speculation that many businesses will themselves suffer financial losses due to the year issue for which such businesses will likely seek reimbursement from their own insurance companies 
state auto financial cannot estimate the nature or extent of its liabilities arising out of claims related to the year issue which may be filed by insureds under the insurance policies it has sold  although it has  along with much of the rest of the industry  sought to clarify its policies provisions that financial losses arising out of its insureds failures to correct their own year issues are not insured losses 
however  the enforceability of these policy endorsements is unknown at this time 
in addition  some state insurance departments are resisting insurers efforts to file such amendatory endorsements 
the estimated costs of the project and the date by which state auto believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s judgment  and information available to it as well as its assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant software code  and the affect of the year issue on regulators and other government agencies  among others

impact of significant external conditions inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amounts of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
