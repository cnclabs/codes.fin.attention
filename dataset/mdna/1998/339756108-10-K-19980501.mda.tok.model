cash flows 
during fiscal  operating activities used million compared to million provided in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivables and inventories

during fiscal  operating activities provided million compared to a use of million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventories  which was principally attributable to substantially reduced raw material unit costs and reduced raw material quantities 
the decrease in inventory was also partially due to higher sales of floorcovering products to franchisees and other carpet retailers 
also contributing was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses relating to construction in progress 
during fiscal  investing activities used million compared to million for fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures relating to manufacturing operations  the purchase of carpet retailers  and the purchase of real estate for the expansion of retail stores

the company anticipates that it will require approximately million for the remainder of fiscal to i open approximately new gallery stores assuming approximately of such stores will be located on company owned property and the remainder on leased property  ii reconfigure three existing carpetmax stores  iii expand its manufacturing capacity and iv upgrade its management information systems 
the company estimates that capital expenditures to open a new gallery store at a leased location will average approximately  net of supplier participations and landlord allowances  which average approximately  per store 
the company estimates that capital expenditures to open a company owned location will average approximately million  net of supplier participations 
pre opening expenses will be approximately  per store 
the actual costs that the company will incur in opening a new gallery store cannot be predicted with precision because the opening costs will vary based upon geographic location  the size of the store  the amount of supplier contributions and the extent of the build out required at the selected site 
the company anticipates that it will require approximately million during the remainder of fiscal for capital expenditures at image  including approximately million associated with the expansion of image s polyester fiber production capacity 
the company believes that the net proceeds from the notes offering  borrowings under the credit facility  the summerville loan and cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet the company s working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations through fiscal as the company s debt matures  the company may need to refinance such debt 
there can be no assurance that such debt can be refinanced or  if so  whether it can be refinanced on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to service its indebtedness  it will be required to adopt alternative strategies  which may include actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on the assessment of the company s information technology personnel  management presently believes that with the planned conversion to new software and hardware and the planned modifications to existing software and hardware  the affects of the year issue will be mitigated 
all costs associated with analyzing the year issue or making conversions to existing software are being expensed as incurred 
the company is planning formal communications with all of its significant suppliers of goods and services to determine the extent to which the company s operations and systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s operations and systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company will utilize predominantly internal resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the company s software for year compliance by june  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
management has not estimated a total cost of the year issues  however  such costs are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations during any quarterly or annual reporting period 
the costs to the company of year compliance and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
