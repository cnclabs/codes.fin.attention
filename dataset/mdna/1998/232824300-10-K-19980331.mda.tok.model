cytogen s focus is to increase the mcos awareness of and to obtain coverage for prostascint while bard is working with the mcos to incorporate prostascint in the mcos patient practice guidelines

alt is a proprietary cellular therapy which has been under development by cellcor for the treatment of mrcc  a life threatening kidney cancer  for which adequate therapies do not exist 
cellcor completed pivotal phase iii clinical trials of alt in mrcc patients in january  and the company believes the results of the trials are favorable

during  the company recorded  of interest expense in connection with the note 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure for year compliance 
the company does not expect that the cost to modify its information technology infrastructure to be year compliant will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be in compliance  and will include disclosure to this effect in its filings 
the company s capital and operating requirements may change depending upon several factors  including i the success of the company and its strategic partners in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products  ii the amount of resources which the company devotes to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of preclinical testing  clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments 
the company s financial objectives are to meet its capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products  subcontract manufacturing  license and research contracts  and control of spending 
to achieve its strategic objectives  the company may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by the company in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
the company currently has no commitments or specific plans for acquisitions or strategic alliances 
however  the company believes that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product related revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  the company may sell equity and debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since its inception  and has expended  and expects to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete its planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further expand its marketing  sales  manufacturing and distribution activities 
the company expects that its existing capital resources and other available sources of financing will be adequate to fund the company s operations into no assurance can be given that the company will not consume a significant amount of its available resources before that time 
in addition  the company expects that it will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when it reaches profitability  for further development of products  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of its products  the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of its products 
to the extent that funds generated from the company s product related sales and license and contract revenues  together with its existing capital resources are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the company has a commitment pursuant to which it may issue up to million in additional series of convertible preferred stock  under certain conditions  however  there can be no assurance that such conditions will be met 
based on the company s historical ability to raise capital and current market conditions  the company believes other financing alternatives are available 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
however  the company believes that it has the ability to reduce its operating expenses so that it will have adequate cash flow to sustain operations into and beyond 
cautionary statement the foregoing discussion contains historical information as well as forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the risks discussed above  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are the following i the timing and results of clinical studies  ii market acceptance of the company s products  including programs designed to facilitate use of the products  such as the pie program  iii the decision by the majority of public and private insurance carriers on whether to reimburse patients for the company s products  iv the profitability of its products  v the ability to attract  and the ultimate success of strategic partnering arrangements  collaborations  and acquisition candidates  vi the ability to attract additional contract manufacturing customers  vii the ability of the company and its partners to identify new products as a result of those collaborations that are capable of achieving fda approval  that are cost effective alternatives to existing products and that are ultimately accepted by the key users of the product  viii the success of the company s marketing partners in obtaining marketing approvals in canada and in european countries  in achieving milestones and achieving sales of products resulting in royalties  and ix the company s ability to access the capital markets in the near term and in the future for continued funding of existing projects and for the pursuit of new projects
