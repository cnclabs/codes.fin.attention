these actions reduced sales and general and administrative expenses by approximately in the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue years ended december revenue operating expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss nonoperating income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss actual year end for is january  revenue

the following table breaks out the company s revenues by business unit years ended december  total total total revenue revenue revenue in thousands commercial systems    software component technologies    aerospace    total revenue    actual year end for is january  commercial systems the commercial systems business unit revenues had a growth rate of in over  and a decrease of in from the increase compared to is primarily in the gis systems  precise positioning  and mobile positioning and communications vertical markets 
the decrease in compared to was primarily in the land survey and mobile positioning and communications vertical markets 
the increase in the gis systems market came from strong sales of the pathfinder product line  where unit sales increased in compared to precise positioning products continued to grow from the prior year and were up on an annual basis 
mobile positioning and communications revenues also increased in compared to  due to the resumption of shipments in march to american mobile satellite corporation amsc  a company based in reston  virginia  that provides a variety of voice and data services via satellite 
in march  the company signed a large contract for the supply of galaxy gps land mobile satellite terminals to amsc 
amsc contracted for delivery of product beginning in mid and continuing through late in the fourth quarter of  amsc requested that the company cease delivery  in part due to delays in amsc s completion of software 
shipments under the original contract were halted in the fourth quarter of and the contract was amended 
on february   an agreement was signed between trimble and amsc to resume shipments of its galaxy gps terminals at the rate of units per month  beginning in march on august   an amendment to the february agreement was signed  to reduce the number of units shipped from units to units per month 
mobile positioning and communications revenues in included  in sales to amsc on  units shipped 
revenues from shipments to systems under this contract during were  in the second quarter and  in the third quarter 
contract renegotiation fees of  were recognized in the first quarter of the amended contract between the company and amsc calls for production line shutdown fees for the time that trimble is not manufacturing product for shipment to amsc 
due to the uncertainty about amsc s ability to pay  revenues for products shipped and contractual shutdown fees were not recognized until collection was considered probable 
in the second quarter of  the company recognized  in revenue from products shipped in december and march  and  of shutdown fees  all of which have been paid 
during the second half of  the company recognized  of shutdown fees after the payments were received 
the decrease in the land survey vertical market sales in compared to and compared to is primarily due to a continued slowdown in sales in japan 
shipments of the higher end real time kinematic rtk survey product in japan have slowed due to the japanese government s decision to evaluate rtk survey methods before certifying its use for official surveys 
the company is now selling at the low cost end of the market as opposed to the high cost end of the market 
also  new product introductions for land survey occurred late in third quarter  therefore  customers held off on placing orders until the new product introductions 
shipments of these products in the us  europe  and latin america were higher than last year 
in september  the company entered into a contract with caterpillar inc to develop and market products for the construction and mining markets 
the company agreed to develop  without funding from caterpillar  customized equipment starting in the fourth quarter of  and to sell it exclusively to caterpillar for use in this market 
shipments began in the company had sales of  in to caterpillar 
the company also expects that average selling prices will likely decline with increased competition 
in addition to the markets the company currently addresses in the surveying and mapping arena primarily land survey  the company is addressing new markets  including the mining and construction market 
if the company cannot adequately compete in new markets through the development and manufacture of new products  there can be no assurance that growth will continue 
in  commercial systems revenue was supplemented by million received under a contract with a customer  whereby the company agreed not to compete  and sold exclusive distribution rights 
software and component technologies the software and component technologies business unit revenues have increased in over  and in from the increase in from is primarily due to the company s receiving million from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable non refundable and non recurring engineering fee recorded in the third quarter of  and a million technology license from pioneer electronics corporation in connection with the expansion of the original licensee for in car navigation technology  which was recorded in the second quarter of in  software and component technologies revenue was supplemented by technology licenses of million 
the software and component technologies market consists of oem original equipment manufacture and consumer products 
aerospace aerospace product sales increased in from  and had a slight decrease in from the increase in was primarily due to shipments to the government under the cugr program  as well as strong sales for the honeywell trimble product ht and strong sales for the military and advanced systems market 
the slight decrease in from was due to weak sales for military products in the company considers its aerospace products to be a long term growth opportunity 
it believes that success in this area will be dependent upon the success of a current strategic alliance with honeywell 
on september   the company received faa certification of the ht product  allowing production and installation to begin late in the third quarter of military sales are highly dependent on contracts that are subject to government approval and are  therefore  expected to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes that opportunities in this market have been substantially reduced by cutbacks in us and foreign military spending 
export sales export sales from domestic operations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that export revenue and sales made by its subsidiaries in locations outside the us will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue  and  therefore  the company is subject to the risks inherent in these sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  and tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  as well as eliminate the use of selective availability s a a method of degrading gps accuracy  there may be a reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology in certain foreign markets  given the control of gps by the us government 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of total revenue of the company in  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  domestic versus international sales  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
in  the gross margin percentage on product sales was  compared with in and in the margins were enhanced by the positive impact of non product revenues recognized from pioneer electronic corporation of million and from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable non refundable  non recurring engineering fee of million 
see results of operations revenue for more details 
in and the company also recorded non recurring items  including revenues recognized from amsc of million in and million in  however  there can be no assurance that similar items will recur in the future 
the decrease in the gross margin percentages primarily reflects a shift in product mix from higher margin commercial systems sales to lower margin avionics products  and decreases in the margins obtained on sales of commercial system products 
in addition  because of mix changes within and among the business units  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  and other factors  there is no assurance that current margins will be sustained 
while commercial systems products have the highest gross margins of all the company s products  their margins have decreased  primarily due to the need to lower prices in response to competition 
the company expects competition to increase in its commercial system markets  and it is therefore likely that further price erosion will occur  with consequent lower gross margin percentages 
the company expects that in the future a higher percentage of its business will be conducted through alliances with strategic partners such as honeywell and caterpillar 
as a result of volume pricing and the assumption of certain operating costs by the partner  margins on this business are likely to be lower than sales directly to end users 
operating expenses 
the following table shows operating expenses for the periods indicated  it should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below years ended december  in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    restructuring charges  total    actual year end for is january  research and development 
research and development spending increased in absolute dollars during  representing of revenue  compared with in and in the dollar increase from to is due primarily to an increase in personnel and the related expenses that accompany such an increase in the number of employees 
there was also an increase in the number of specialized engineering consultants and temporary employees 
the increase in research and development is part of the company s continuing aggressive development of future products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased during  representing of revenue  compared with in both and the primary reason for the dollar decreases in expenses since is a decrease in personnel due to the company s restructuring in and advertising costs 
other less significant reasons for the decreases are lower marketing related and field service support costs 
selling and marketing expenses are expected to be approximately in the future as a percentage of revenue  as a result of continued cost containment programs 
in  sales offices in china  egypt  italy and poland were closed  and the sizes of certain offices in the us have been reduced 
the company s future growth will depend on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which the company currently competes  and on the company s ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for its products 
in addition  the company has encountered significant competition in selected markets  and expects such competition to intensify as the market for gps applications receives acceptance 
several of the company s competitors are major corporations with substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources 
increased competition is likely to result in reduced market share and in price reductions of gps based products  which could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars during  representing of revenue  compared with in  and remained flat as a percentage of revenue compared to at 
the dollar decrease from to is due primarily to decreases in outside services related to legal fees associated with certain arbitration and litigation matters during the increase in over is primarily a result of the higher litigation and legal settlement costs incurred in the first six months of the year  compared to the same period in  as well as an increase in the bad debt expense and amortization of goodwill related to the terra acquisition 
restructuring charges 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a restructuring charge of  components of this restructuring reserve included employee severance packages  the costs of redundant office space and write downs of idle assets 
the company took this action in order to bring operating expenses into line with revenues and to restructure existing operations in a more efficient manner 
nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating income expense  net  includes interest income and expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange gains were  in  compared with a loss of  in and a gain of million in in the second quarter of  the company adopted a policy of hedging its exposure to foreign currency transactions to minimize the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions 
most of the foreign exchange gains recorded in were incurred in the period before this policy was in place 
interest income decreased in from due to lower interest income received on cash and short term investments due to lower average balances for the year 
interest income increased in over  primarily due to higher interest income received on cash and short term investments in the first half of  compared with the first half of  primarily from the company s secondary public offering proceeds in august interest expense increased slightly in due to higher fees on unused lines of credit 
interest expense includes interest on a million note issued in august  and fees on unused lines of credit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt and lines of credit 
income tax provision the company s effective tax rates of in and in are less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the realization of previously reserved deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit rate of is less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to limitations on the utilization of the operating loss 
inflation 
the effects of inflation on the company s financial results have not been significant to date 
litigation the company is involved in a number of legal matters that occupy management time and expense 
these matters are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company does not expect to suffer significant adverse effects from this litigation  or from unasserted claims  the nature of litigation is unpredictable  and there can be no assurance that it will not do so 
liquidity and capital resources in  the cash used in operating activities was million 
cash provided by sales of common stock in represents proceeds from purchases made pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and totaled million 
during  the company has relied primarily on cash provided by financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund operations  capital expenditures and other investing activities 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and management of inventory levels 
in august  the company entered into a three year  unsecured revolving credit facility with four banks the credit agreement 
this credit facility replaced the previous two year  unsecured line that expired in august the credit agreement enables the company to borrow up to  provided that certain financial and other covenants are met 
under a separate agreement the company has an additional  line of credit provided only by the lead bank under the credit agreement for letter of credit purposes  and this is also subject to the covenants in the main facility 
the credit agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee of and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the total funded debt to ebitda is less than or equal to times  and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times and less than or equal to times  or and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times 
in addition to borrowing at the specified libor rate  the company has the right to borrow with interest at the higher of i one of the bank s annual prime rate and ii the federal funds rate plus 
to date  the company has not made any borrowings under the lines 
in addition  the company is restricted from paying dividends under the terms of the credit agreement 
in  the cash used in operating activities was million 
cash provided by sales of common stock in represents proceeds from purchases made pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and totaled million 
during  the company relied primarily on cash provided by financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund operations  capital expenditures and other investing activities 
in february  the company announced that it had approved a discretionary program whereby up to  shares of its common stock may be repurchased on the open market to offset the potential dilutive effects to earnings per share from the issuance of stock options 
the company intends to use existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to finance any stock repurchases under this program 
in   shares were purchased at a cost of  in   shares were purchased at a cost of  and the company intends to continue repurchasing its common stock under this program 
the company presently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily for production equipment  computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
at january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
its long term debt consisted primarily of a million note obligation due in  and the company had no debt outstanding under its line of credit 
the company believes that its current cash balances  available bank financing  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs in the foreseeable future 
year issue issues involving the year are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has formulated a plan and methodology for addressing year problems and is currently implementing such plan 
the company anticipates completing the year project within the year but no later than december  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
anticipated spending for the modifications will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s on going results of operations 
certain other risk factors the company s revenue has tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of licensee rights 
a significant portion of quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of a quarter 
if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  the operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
future revenues are difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models  which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
the company has a relatively fixed cost structure in the short term which is determined by the business plans and strategies the company intends to implement in the three markets it addresses 
this effective leveraging means that increases or decreases in revenues have more than a proportional impact on net income or losses 
the company estimates that a change in product revenue of million would change earnings per share by to cents 
in the longer term  the company believes that the software and component technologies business unit will produce a significant portion of the company s business 
the software and component technologies business unit differs in nature from most of the company s markets because volumes are high and margins relatively low 
software and component technologies customers are extremely price sensitive 
as costs decrease through technological advances  these advances will be passed on to the customer 
to compete in the software and component technologies market requires high volume production and manufacturing techniques 
customers expect high quality standards with very low defect rates 
compared to competitors which have far greater resources in such high volume manufacturing and associated support activities  the company is relatively inexperienced 
the company s stock price is subject to significant volatility 
if revenues and or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the trading price of the company s stock 
the value of the company s products relies substantially on its technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
the company recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to the company s attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for the company to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign its products 
the company does not believe that any of its products infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but cannot be certain that they do not 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues or profitability 
the company is continuously evaluating alliances and external investments in technologies related to its business  and has already entered into alliances and made relatively small investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products and alliances entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  and iii loss of key employees of acquired operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
no assurances can be given that the company will not incur problems from current or future alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will realize value from any such alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
information with respect to gps navstar satellite system is included in part i of this report  under the caption background  paragraph new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 sfas earnings per share  which the company was required to adopt on december  in preparing its financial statements for the current fiscal year  the company has been required to change the method previously used to compute earnings per share  and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements  primary earnings per share has been replaced by a simpler calculation called basic earnings per share 
this calculation excludes all common stock equivalents and other dilutive securities ie  options  warrants and convertible instruments 
under the new requirements  dilutive earnings per share replaces the existing fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the new diluted earnings per share includes the effect of all dilutive instruments if they meet certain requirements 
the impact of sfas on the calculation of basic and dilutive earnings per share for the fiscal years reported is not material

it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
because sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   the company will adopt the new requirements for reporting in fiscal year and retroactively restate fiscal year management has not completed its review of sfas  but does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on the company s reported segments
