early in the season  the number of hospital admissions and positive cultures for rsv suggested a heavy incidence of infection 
however  the severity of infection in this season was not as high as the prior seasons nor as heavy as such earlier evidence indicated  resulting in a lower hospital demand for virazole r and consequently an increased level of inventory at the wholesale level 
the increased wholesale inventory levels  combined with trends in the industry toward managed health care during the first part of the season  adversely impacted total virazole r sales despite additional sales promotional efforts which included more favorable credit terms and sales discounts

management believes that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures estimated at  for the coming year 
also  if the historic rate of growth in eastern europe continues  these operations will require increasing levels of working capital and funds for additional facilities or upgrading of existing facilities

inflation and changing prices foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  political instability and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the effect of these risks remains difficult to predict 
during the last three years  the cumulative inflation rate in mexico has exceeded 
in  the company began translating the financial statements of its operations in mexico using accounting methods that apply to hyperinflationary economies  resulting in a foreign exchange loss of approximately  at december   mexico had a net monetary asset position of approximately  which would be subject to loss if a devaluation were to occur 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency risk on its foreign denominated debt of  at december   which is primarily denominated in swiss francs and german marks and  at alkaloida  in us dollars  and to devaluation losses on net monetary asset positions in yugoslavia and russia 
see icn yugoslavia below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at december   the net monetary asset position of the company s russian operations was  which would be subject to a loss if a devaluation were to occur 
the effects of inflation are experienced by the company through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
the company is subject to price control restrictions on its pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which it operates 
while the company attempts to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  the company has been affected by the lag in allowed price increases in yugoslavia and mexico  which has created lower sales in us dollars and reductions in gross profit 
future sales and gross profit could be materially affected if the company is unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation 
pharmaceutical prices in neither the united states nor the russian pharmaceutical markets are heavily regulated by the government 
the year issue the company is pursuing an action plan to be year compliant in all locations by the middle of the company does not have heavy reliance on custom  internally generated software  the company principally uses third party software that is in most cases already year compliant 
the company has completed an assessment of its worldwide computer systems and has determined that it will be required to perform some modification or replacement of software so that all systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the cost of making the company s information systems and software year compliant is not expected to be material to the financial results of the company 
the company does not consider itself particularly vulnerable to third parties failure to remediate those third parties own year issues and continues to assess the issue 
icn yugoslavia icn yugoslavia  a owned subsidiary  operates in a business environment that is subject to significant economic volatility and political instability 
the current economic trend in yugoslavia is toward unfavorable economic conditions that include continuing liquidity problems  inflation and monetary exposures  potential currency devaluation  government spending limitations  credit risk  political instability  sanctions and price controls 
the future of the economic and political environment of yugoslavia is uncertain and could deteriorate to the point that a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations could occur 
yugoslavia is subject to political instability 
the elections that took place in have not resulted in a change of political leadership that would provide for a foundation of significant economic reforms 
the federal republic of yugoslavia is comprised of two states  serbia and the much smaller state of montenegro 
within yugoslavia there exist political dissension and unrest 
the state of montenegro has been active in seeking greater autonomy from serbia 
additionally  recent social unrest in the serbian province of kosovo could lead to increased instability in the balkans 
united states diplomats have warned that the serbian actions and policies in kosovo could lead to the reinstatement of economic sanctions on yugoslavia 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflationary trends in yugoslavia continue to worsen  resulting in increased risk of a devaluation of the yugoslavian dinar in during  the company has reduced its net monetary asset exposure by  from its net monetary asset position of  at the beginning of the reduction in net monetary asset exposure was achieved through the conversion of dinar denominated accounts receivable into notes receivable payable in dinars  but fixed in dollar amounts 
at december   icn yugoslavia holds approximately  notes receivable from the yugoslavian government 
icn yugoslavia s net monetary asset exposure of approximately  at december  would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of the dinar were to occur 
since the last devaluation on november   the cumulative level of inflation has been estimated at approximately 
if a devaluation were to occur based on this level of inflation  and assuming the company s net monetary exposure of  at december   the company could incur a foreign exchange loss of approximately  the risk of devaluation increases as time passes and inflation continues 
however  the company is unable to predict either the exact magnitude or the timing of any future devaluation
