such statements  which include statements concerning the timing of availability and functionality of products under development  product mix  trends in average selling prices  trends in the pc market  the percentage of export sales and sales to strategic customers and the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below and in item of this report under the caption business factors that may affect results  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes 
net income the company s operating results have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold and in the mix of sales by distribution channels  the gain or loss of significant customers  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
the company s operating results may fluctuate from those in prior periods or may be adversely affected in periods in which the company is undergoing a product line transition in which production and sales of new products are ramping up and in which existing products are under extreme price pressures due to competitive factors 
if new products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address market needs or performance requirements  then the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in net sales or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
net sales the company s net sales to date have been generated from the sale of its graphics and multimedia accelerators 
the company s products are used in  and its business is dependent on  the personal computer industry with sales primarily in the us  asia  and europe 
net sales were million in  a decrease below the million in net sales for consisted primarily of the company s virge and trio families of integrated accelerators 
the fluctuation in sales from to was a result of declining unit average selling prices due to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors as well as the sale of older generation products  offset by the increase in unit shipments 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
due to competitive price pressures  the company s products experience declining unit average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
net sales were million in  a increase above the million in net sales increased in primarily as a result of the addition of the virge product line and strong demand for the company s bit trio products that resulted in increased unit shipments 
the increased sales of the virge and trio family of accelerators was partially offset by a decrease in the bit vision family of accelerators  which has decreased significantly as the company transitioned to sales of its virge family of d d accelerators 
the pricing environment for graphics accelerators has recently experienced and is expected to continue to experience increasing pricing pressures due in part to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors as well as the sale of older generation products 
in particular  the company s trio family of integrated d accelerators experienced significant decreases in average selling prices in the graphics accelerator market is transitioning from d acceleration to d acceleration  and the company has introduced its virge family of d d accelerators in response to this transition 
as a result of the entry of competitors into the d acceleration market  the company has experienced and anticipates that it may continue to experience increased pricing pressures on average selling prices for the virge family of d d accelerators 
if the company is unable to introduce and successfully market higher performance products  if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance  or if the pricing pressures increase above normal anticipated levels  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
export sales accounted for   and of net sales in   and respectively 
approximately of export sales in were to affiliates of united states customers 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
three customers accounted for  and of net sales in two customers accounted for and of net sales in two customers accounted for and of net sales in the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers or that such customers will not otherwise cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  that such orders will be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s largest customer in was the company s largest asian distributor  and a substantial percentage of the company s net sales were made through distributors 
the occurrence of any supply problems for the company s products may adversely affect the rate of growth in net sales 
net sales may also be adversely affected by delays in the production ramp of customers new programs and systems which incorporate the company s products 
in addition  the company generally ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s net sales for that quarter 
the company s reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces the company s ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
gross margin gross margin percentage was  and in  and  respectively 
the gross margin in was impacted by decreases in overall average selling prices of the bit trio family and virge family of accelerators  which resulted in part from the increased proportion of the company s export sales to asian customers and the substantial price competition experienced in the asian market 
in addition  the company does not currently offer products addressing the high performance d acceleration market  which adversely affects the company s gross margin 
these factors were offset in part by the profitability of the usc joint venture  and the decrease in unit average costs resulting from the company s foundries conversion to inch 
micron technology 
the company s proportionate share of usc s net income was million in the gross margin in was impacted by decreases in overall average selling prices of the bit trio family and virge family of accelerators  offset by the decrease in the unit average costs resulting from the company s foundries conversion to inch wafers and micron technology and changes in the pricing strategies from independent foundries for finished goods inventory due to the alleviation of supply constraints in and shift in product mix from the vision products to the virge products 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in the unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold  the profitability of the usc joint venture the company recognizes its proportionate share of usc profits and losses  the extent to which the company forfeits or utilizes it production capacity rights with tsmc  the extent to which the company will incur additional licensing fees and shifts in sales mix between add in card and motherboard manufacturers and systems oems 
the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments and  because the markets for the company s products are volatile and its products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s operating results  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customers changes and cancellations 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
research and development expenses the company has made and intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off approximately million of intangible assets  including certain licenses  patents and other technology  as a result of management s decision to focus attention on the core graphics business 
as a result of this decision  no future cash flows were expected related to these assets 
in addition  research and development spending increases reflect additions to the company s engineering staff and initial product verification and nonrecurring engineering expenses related to the introduction of new products  including product development for the desktop  mobile and home pc markets 
products in the company s market typically have a life cycle of to months 
the successful development and commercialization of new products required to replace or supplement existing products involve many risks  including the identification of new product opportunities  the successful and timely completion of the development process  and the selection of the company s products by leading systems suppliers and motherboard and add in card manufacturers for design into their products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring to the market in a timely manner successful new products  that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive  or that the company s products will be selected for design into its customers products 
in addition  it is possible that the company s products may be found defective after the company has already shipped significant volume production 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully correct such problems or that such corrections would be acceptable to customers 
the occurrence of any such events would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling and marketing costs have increased from year to year as a result of additional personnel  increased commissions and increased marketing costs associated with the introduction of new products 
administrative costs have increased due to the hiring of additional personnel necessary to support the increased level of operations 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  decreased in to million of expense in from million of income in the decrease is attributable to the interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which were issued by the company in september  as well as lower average amounts of cash and short term investments  which resulted in a decrease in interest income 
other income  net  decreased in to million from million in the decrease is attributable to the interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which were issued by the company in september income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was in  in and in the tax rate was lower due to an increased income tax benefit from research and development credits and as a result of lower pre tax profits 
the tax rate was lower due to an increase in tax credits as a result of the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments decreased in by million to million from million at the end of the company used million for operating activities and used million for investing activities in in addition  the company generated million of cash from financing activities 
cash used for operating activities was million in  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in the decrease in was due to lower net income  an increase in inventories  prepaid expenses and other  and a decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory was due to the company s effort to reduce the amount of inventory in the channel resulting in increased inventory on hand at december  the decrease in accounts receivable was a result of lower sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was due to higher net income  lower accounts receivable  and income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses and other and a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable is a result of greater linearity in sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  in which a substantial proportion of shipments occurred in the third month of that quarter as compared to the first two months of that quarter 
the increase in inventory is primarily due to higher levels of finished goods to support increased levels of business 
cash provided by operating activities for was million primarily due to an increase in net income and to working capital management in as compared to the company experienced an increase in inventory and accounts receivable due to a substantial increase in net sales 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
continued expansion of the company s business is likely to require higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities for the years ended december    and reflected property and equipment purchases  purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments  and a technology investment 
continued expansion of the company s business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily the result of sales of common stock pursuant to employee stock option and stock purchase plans and borrowings on notes payable 
the increase in primarily reflects the offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes completed in september net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately million 
the notes mature in interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
beginning in october  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company at an initial redemption price of of the principal amount 
the company has reserved  shares of common stock plus such additional number of shares that may be required pursuant to the operation of anti dilution provisions for the conversion of these notes 
the amount primarily reflects the net proceeds of the follow on common stock offering completed in may in  the company entered into two long term manufacturing capacity arrangements 
the company entered into an agreement with umc and alliance semiconductor corporation to form usc  a separate taiwanese company  for the purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan  republic of china 
the company invested million in and million in for its equity interest 
in january  the company reduced its equity interest to through the sale of a portion of its usc shares  and received approximately million in cash 
under the terms of the agreement  if at any time a liquidity event occurs  s will be entitled to receive  in addition to the initial payment of billion new taiwan dollars  a contingent payment of up to new taiwan dollars per share  or up to an additional billion new taiwan dollars approximately us million at exchange rates prevailing on december  
a liquidity event is defined as any event by which umc  or its successor  will have the opportunity to receive value from transfer of its ownership of shares of stock in usc in an arms length transaction other than by way of transfer to employees for incentives  whether or not umc or its successor  in fact  participates in such opportunity 
a liquidity event will include  for example  completion of a public offering of usc securities on a recognized securities exchange  a sale of usc stock owned by umc or by a umc successor in an arms length transaction  or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of usc 
the facility commenced production utilizing advanced submicron semiconductor manufacturing processes in late the company has the right to purchase up to of the output from the foundry 
in addition  the company expanded and formalized its relationship with tsmc to provide additional capacity over the to timeframe 
the agreement with tsmc requires the company to make certain annual advance payments to be applied against the following year s capacity 
the company has signed promissory notes to secure these payments  which total million as of december   over the term of the agreement 
the company paid million in and million in see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
at december  the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
in addition  the company has a million unsecured revolving line of credit that expires september  the company had million outstanding under the line of credit as of december  the company was not in compliance with one financial covenant at december  accordingly  the bank is not required to fund requested borrowing 
subsequent to year end  the lender waived non compliance with the violated debt covenant for the period ended december  the company believes it will not be in compliance with this covenant for the current quarter but does not expect current non compliance to materially affect the company s liquidity or financial condition 
in addition  the company has available two separate secured equipment lines of credit totaling million 
the company had million and million outstanding under these secured equipment lines of credit at december  and  respectively 
the company must maintain certain financial covenants in connection with these lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its available funds will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  other than expenditures for future potential manufacturing agreements 
in january  the company agreed to a patent purchase and cross licensing deal with cirrus logic  inc to enable a patent portfolio exchange between the two companies 
through this patent purchase  s purchased graphics patents and graphics patent applications from cirrus logic for a price of million 
with respect to cirrus logic s remaining patents not covered in the purchase  and s s patents  s and cirrus logic have entered into an accompanying cross licensing agreement 
under the terms of the cross licensing agreement  s and cirrus logic have a perpetual license to each other s graphics patents and additional licenses with respect to the other party s patents for agreed upon periods of time 
the closing of both the patent purchase and cross licensing agreement occurred in march in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  equity investments in  advances or issuances of equity securities to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct wafer fabrication facilities 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technology or products that complement the business of the company 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company experiences from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  because the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products because the company s products are volatile and subject to rapid technological and price changes 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
in october  brooktree filed a complaint against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of the company s current products infringed a brooktree patent 
such lawsuit resulted in substantial expense to the company to defend the action and diverted the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel 
in august  the company and brooktree entered into a settlement and license agreement pursuant to which all claims and counterclaims between the parties were dismissed and the company agreed to pay to brooktree a license fee and royalties related to certain product revenues over a five year period 
since november  a number of complaints have been filed in federal and state courts seeking an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased shares of the company s common stock at various times between april  and november  the complaints name as defendants the company  certain of its officers and former officers and certain directors of the company  asserting that they violated federal and state securities laws by misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about the company s business 
in addition  certain shareholders have filed derivative actions seeking recovery on behalf of the company  alleging  among other things  breach of fiduciary duties by such individual defendants 
the company has not yet formally responded to these complaints 
while management intends to defend the actions against the company vigorously  there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with regards to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has received from the united states securities and exchange commission a request for information relating to the company s restatement announcement in november the company has responded and intends to continue to respond to such requests
