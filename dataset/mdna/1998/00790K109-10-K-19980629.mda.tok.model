recent pronouncements the company will adopt sfas  reporting comprehensive income effective april  sfas established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
the company does not have any non owner changes in equity other than net income 
upon adoption  comprehensive income and the cumulative other comprehensive income will be reported in a consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
the company will adopt sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  effective april  this pronouncement changes the requirements under which public businesses must report segment information 
the objective of the pronouncement is to provide information about a company s different types of business activities and different economic environments 
sfas will require companies to select segments based on their internal reporting system 
management is currently assessing the requirements of this pronouncement and the effect it will have  if any  on the company s disclosure 
the company will adopt sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  as of april  this pronouncement revises employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans  however  it does require additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets in order to facilitate financial analysis

impact of inflation changes in prices charged by manufacturers and wholesalers for pharmaceuticals dispensed by the company affects its cost of revenues

as a result  changes in pharmaceutical prices due to inflation have not adversely affected the company 
year issues the company has formed a year project team to address the year issue 
the company will incur internal costs as well as external consulting expenses in order to prepare its systems for the new century 
the company is still evaluating the magnitude of these costs  but the company does not believe the costs associated with the year project will be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to address the year issue will be entirely successful 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the software and systems of other companies from which the company transacts business will become year compliant in a timely manner 
any such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s systems and operations
