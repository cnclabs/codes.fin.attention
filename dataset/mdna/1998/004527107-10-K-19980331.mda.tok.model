overview we reported net income of million in  compared to million in this increase in net income in part reflects increased operating cash flow as defined below of our out of home advertising and broadcasting operations 
in addition  a component of our strategy is to expand our businesses through acquisitions 
as a result  our results of operations reflect depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense on long term debt  which are in part attributable to past acquisitions 
in addition  the increase in our net income in from reflects a million income tax benefit primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset and a million reduction in an accrual for litigation expense  offset in part by a million charge for stock compensation expense 
disregarding the impact of this reduction in the accrual for litigation expense and stock compensation expense  income before income taxes and extraordinary items would have been million for compared to million for operating cash flow for was million  compared to million for refinancing 
in january  we replaced our credit agreement with our new million credit agreement 
the credit agreement currently permits borrowings of up to million due to restrictions related to the senior notes 
the credit agreement further provides that if we redeem our senior notes prior to december   the maximum permissible borrowings under the credit agreement will be increased to million 
in addition  subsequent to the redemption of the senior notes and prior to december   the total available under the revolving credit facility can be increased by million only to refinance the partnership s credit agreement 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were outstanding 
we currently intend to redeem the senior notes in the fourth quarter of  which would result in non recurring charges for the write off of deferred financing costs and redemption fees 
accordingly  if we redeem the senior notes as planned  we expect to incur a non recurring charge of approximately million at the time of such redemption 
we intend to redeem the senior notes with the proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement 
acquisitions and time brokerage agreements 
on june   we entered into a time brokerage agreement to operate television station wutr licensed to utica  new york 
on july   we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire television station wivt formerly wmgc licensed to binghamton  new york for million 
we are operating the station pending closing of the purchase under a time brokerage agreement 
we own a limited partnership interest in the partnership  which owns and operates radio stations in the seattle market 
in february  the partnership redeemed the limited partnership interests of the two former limited partners and satisfied certain other obligations for million 
in february  we joined in an agreement that provides for the partnership to redeem the general partner s interest for approximately million 
the redemption requires approval of the fcc  which we have requested 
we currently anticipate receiving the fcc s consent and closing this transaction in  following which we will be the sole owner of the stations 
in addition  we acquired the assets of a small billboard company in south florida in november and the assets of khho am  a radio station in tacoma  washington  in march as with many media companies that have grown through acquisitions  our acquisitions and dispositions of television and radio stations have resulted in significant non cash and non recurring charges to income 
for this reason  in addition to net income loss  our management believes that operating cash flow defined as net revenue less operating expenses before amortization  depreciation  interest  litigation and stock compensation expenses is an appropriate measure of our financial performance 
similarly  we believe that segment operating cash flow defined as operating cash flow before corporate overhead is an appropriate measure of our segments financial performance 
these measures exclude certain expenses that management does not consider to be costs of ongoing operations 
we use operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on our long term debt as well as to finance capital expenditures 
operating cash flow and segment operating cash flow  however  are not to be considered as alternatives to net income loss as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity

no such adjustment was made in stock compensation expense 
in  we recognized million of stock compensation expense  which was primarily due to the conversion of incentive stock options into nonqualified stock options as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we did not recognize any stock compensation expense in income tax expense 
in  we incurred a million income tax benefit  compared to an income tax expense of million in this benefit primarily resulted from the recognition of a deferred tax asset in  offset in part by alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
recognition of this deferred tax asset in occurred as a result of a million decrease in the company s valuation allowance  primarily through utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance 
our management expects to recognize income tax expense at approximately statutory rates in this forward looking statement is  however  subject to the qualifications set forth under forward looking statements above

the credit agreement further provides that if we redeem our senior notes prior to december   the maximum permissible borrowings under the credit agreement will be increased to million  which will consist of a million term loan facility and a revolving credit facility of million 
in addition  subsequent to the redemption of the senior notes and prior to december   the total available under the revolving credit facility can be increased by million only to refinance the partnership s credit agreement 
see overview refinancing above 
in addition  in february the partnership replaced its previous credit agreement with a new credit agreement providing for borrowings up to million partnership credit agreement 
the borrowings are secured by a pledge of all the partnership s assets 
subsequent to the redemption of the senior notes and prior to december   it is expected that the partnership credit agreement will terminate and be refinanced with borrowings under the credit agreement  and that the maximum borrowings permitted under the credit agreement will be increased by million 
as of march   we had utilized million of our revolving credit facility and had available million for future borrowings under the credit agreement 
as of the same date  the partnership had utilized million and had available million for future borrowings under the partnership credit agreement 
we will be required to repay the outstanding revolving credit facility in quarterly installments from march through june if we redeem the senior notes  we will be required to repay outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility in quarterly installments from march through june we can choose to have interest calculated under the credit agreement at a base rate or libor rate plus defined margins 
as of march   the annual interest rate of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement was approximately and under the partnership credit agreement was approximately the company had million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding at december  the subordinated notes require principal repayments of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we have pledged all of our subsidiaries outstanding stock as collateral for amounts due under the credit agreement and the senior notes 
thus  if we default under the credit agreement or the senior notes  the lenders may take possession of and sell some or all of our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations 
similarly  the partnership has pledged all its assets under the partnership credit agreement 
if the partnership defaults under the partnership credit agreement  the lenders may take possession of and sell some or all of the partnership s assets to satisfy its obligations  subject to applicable fcc restrictions 
in addition  the credit agreement  the senior notes and the subordinated notes restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow  pay dividends  repurchase outstanding shares of our stock  and sell or transfer our assets 
they also contain restrictive covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
see business restrictions on our operations 
in connection with our time brokerage agreements with the owners of television stations wutr and kion  we have guaranteed certain bank loan obligations of the station owners 
the aggregate principal balance outstanding on such obligations was million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our working capital was million  as of december   million  as of december   and million as of december  we expended million  million and million for capital expenditures in  and  respectively 
our management anticipates that capital expenditures  consisting primarily of construction and maintenance of billboard structures  broadcasting equipment  the seattle supersonics aircraft  and other capital additions  will be between million and million 
this forward looking statement is  however  subject to the qualifications set forth under forward looking statements above 
for the fiscal years through  we have financed our working capital needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities 
over that period  our long term liquidity needs  including for acquisitions  have been financed through additions to our long term debt  principally through bank borrowings and the sale of senior and subordinated debt securities 
capital expenditures for new property and equipment have been financed with both cash provided by operating activities and long term debt 
cash provided by operating activities for increased to million from million in this increase is mainly due to one time advance payments made in related to seattle supersonics players contracts 
impact of year some of our older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions and engage in normal business activities 
we have completed a preliminary assessment to identify and mitigate year related issues 
based on our assessment  we identified that most of our core business software that will be in use by has been certified in writing to be year compliant by the vendors 
however  we are aware of some core business software that has not been certified and are in the process of obtaining certification or replacing the software 
in addition  system replacement projects are being actively planned for core business software that is known today to have year issues 
these systems are scheduled to be replaced  regardless of year issues  by mid we also identified some of the components of our custom developed software that are currently not year compliant 
as a result  we have completed a detailed assessment and have developed an action plan to address these issues by the end of lastly  we do not have total control of systems used in electronic communications with third parties eg  banks  vendors  eg if these systems are not successfully modified to address year issues  the operations of our company may be negatively impacted 
however  as part of our year project  due to be completed in  we intend to identify exposure areas and plan alternative solutions 
based on our assessment  we believe the year issue will not pose significant risk to our operations 
modifications and upgrades directly related to year issues are not expected to have a material financial impact upon our company 
quarterly variations our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due in part to the timing of acquisitions and to seasonal variations in the operations of the broadcasting and sports entertainment segments 
in particular  our net revenue and operating cash flow historically have been affected positively during the nba basketball season the first  second and fourth quarters and by increased advertising activity in the second and fourth quarters 
taxes at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expires in the years through  and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
inflation the effects of inflation on our costs generally have been offset by our ability to correspondingly increase our rate structure 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes standards for reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income which refers to unrealized gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are excluded from net income 
adoption of this statement is required in currently  we do not engage in any transactions that would result in the reporting of comprehensive income 
other on march   the board of governors voted to reopen the nba s collective bargaining agreement with the national basketball players association 
as a result  the current agreement will expire on june  while the desire is to reach a new agreement before june  there is no assurance that the parties will do so 
if the parties fail to reach a new agreement before the start of the season  there is a risk that all or a portion of that season could be cancelled 
in such event  our operating cash flow could be adversely affected 
however  the loss of revenue would be partially offset by a substantial reduction of operating expenses  primarily players salaries
