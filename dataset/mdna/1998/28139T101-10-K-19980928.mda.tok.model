item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the information filed in response to item and item unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june background edmc is among the largest providers of proprietary postsecondary education in the united states  based on student enrollments and revenues 
through its operating units  the art institutes  nyrs  ncpt and ncpd  the company offers associate s and bachelor s degree programs and non degree programs in the areas of design  media arts and technology  culinary arts  fashion and professional development 
the company has provided career oriented education programs since  and its schools have graduated over  students 
the company s main operating unit  the art institutes  consists of schools in major metropolitan areas throughout the united states and accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in net revenues  income before interest and taxes and net income increased in each of the last two years 
net revenues are presented after deducting refunds  scholarships and other adjustments 
net revenues increased to million in from million in income before interest and taxes increased to million in from million in net income increased by to million in from million in average quarterly student enrollments at the company s schools were  in compared to  in the increase in average enrollments relates to  among other factors  new education programs and additional school locations  along with expanded bachelor s degree and evening degree program offerings 
the company s revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing fees and student supply store and restaurant sales 
in  the company derived of its net revenues from net tuition and fees paid by  or on behalf of  its students 
tuition revenue generally varies based on the average tuition charge per credit hour and the average student population 
student supply store and housing revenue is largely a function of the average student population 
the average student population is influenced by the number of continuing students attending school at the beginning of a fiscal period and by the number of new students entering school during such period 
new students enter the art institutes and ncpt at the beginning of each academic quarter  which typically commence in january  april  july and october 
programs at nyrs start eight times throughout the year 
the company believes that the size of its student population is influenced by the number of graduating high school students  the attractiveness of its program offerings  the effectiveness of its marketing efforts  the strength of employment markets  the persistence of its students  the length of its education programs and general economic conditions 
the introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and the establishment of new schools through acquisition or start up are important factors influencing the company s average student population 
tuition increases have been implemented in varying amounts in each of the past several years 
historically  the company has been able to pass along cost increases through increases in tuition 
the company believes that it can continue to increase tuition as educational costs at other postsecondary institutions  both public and private  continue to rise 
the company s schools implemented tuition rate increases averaging approximately for the fall quarter of tuition rates have generally been consistent across the company s schools and programs 
however  as the company enters more markets in different geographic regions  tuition rates across company schools might not remain consistent 
the majority of students at the art institutes and nyrs rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
for the year ended june   approximately of the company s net revenues was indirectly derived from title iv programs 
educational services expense consists primarily of costs related to the development  delivery and administration of the company s education programs 
major cost components are faculty compensation  administrative salaries  costs of educational materials  facility leases and school occupancy costs  information systems costs  bad debt expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
during  the art institutes faculty comprised approximately full time and approximately part time employees 
in  these same percentages were and  respectively 
general and administrative expense consists of marketing and student admissions expenses and certain central staff departmental costs such as executive management  finance and accounting  legal and corporate development and other departments that do not provide direct services to the company s students 
the company has centralized many of these services to gain consistency in management reporting  efficiency in administrative effort and control of costs 
all marketing and student admissions costs are expensed in the fiscal year incurred 
amortization of intangibles relates to the values assigned to student enrollment agreements and applications  accreditation  contracts with colleges and universities and goodwill 
these intangible assets arose principally from the application of purchase accounting to the establishment and financing of the esop and the related leveraged transaction in october and the acquisitions of the schools discussed below 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
esop expense equals the sum of the payments on the esop term loan  plus repurchases of shares from participants in the esop  less the dividends paid on the series a preferred stock that was held by the esop 
as of june   the entire esop term loan was repaid and  in november  the ipo was consummated 
as a result  there was no esop expense in or coincident with the ipo  the esop converted its shares of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock and  therefore  dividends are no longer payable on the series a preferred stock 
in november  the company purchased the assets of the two schools of ray college of design for million in cash and the assumption of specified liabilities 
the company acquired accounts receivable  property and equipment and certain other assets 
the schools  which regained eligibility as of march to participate in title iv programs  were renamed the illinois institute of art at chicago and the illinois institute of art at schaumburg 
in  the company established the art institute of phoenix  at which classes commenced in january the school became eligible to participate in title iv programs in august during  the company deferred approximately million of certain pre opening non marketing and admissions costs associated with the art institute of phoenix start up 
all of the costs deferred in were expensed in in august  the company purchased certain assets of nyrs for approximately million 
the company acquired current assets net of specified current liabilities  property and equipment  student enrollment agreements  curriculum  trade names and certain other assets 
the school regained its eligibility as of november to participate in title iv programs 
in january  the company acquired the assets of lowthian college in minneapolis  minnesota for million  which included the assumption of certain liabilities 
the school  which regained eligibility as of april to participate in title iv programs  has been renamed the art institutes international minnesota 
in march  the company established the art institute of los angeles  at which classes began in october the school became eligible to participate in title iv programs in february in connection with this start up  marketing and student recruiting activities commenced in april the million of pre opening costs were expensed as incurred in in december  the company purchased certain assets of the louise salinger school in san francisco  california for million in cash 
the company also entered into a consulting agreement with its former president in exchange for an option to purchase  shares of common stock 
the school was renamed the art institutes international at san francisco and regained its eligibility to participate in title iv programs in april in february  the company acquired certain assets of bassist college in portland  oregon  from bassist corporation  for approximately million in cash 
the purchase agreement provides for additional consideration based upon a specified percentage of gross revenues over the next five years 
the school regained its eligibility to participate in title iv programs in april and was renamed the art institutes international at portland 
start up schools and smaller acquisitions are expected to incur operating losses during the first two to three years following their opening or purchase 
the combined operating losses of the company s newer schools in california  minnesota and oregon were approximately million in results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationships of certain income statement items to net revenues 
year ended june  net revenues costs and expenses educational services general and administrative amortization of intangibles esop expense income before interest and taxes interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income year ended june  compared with year ended june  net revenues net revenues increased by to million in from million in the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in average quarterly student enrollments million and an approximate tuition price increase million at schools owned by edmc prior to  and the addition of three schools million

net housing revenues increased by to million in from million in and revenues from the sale of educational materials in increased by to million 
both increased primarily as a result of higher average student enrollments 
refunds for increased from million in to million in as a percentage of gross revenue  refunds decreased slightly from educational services educational services expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional costs required to service higher student enrollments  accompanied by normal cost increases for wages and other services at the schools owned by edmc prior to million and schools added in and million 
higher costs associated with establishing and supporting new schools and developing new education programs contributed to the increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by to million in from million in due to the incremental marketing and student admissions expenses incurred to generate higher student enrollments at the schools owned by edmc prior to million  and additional marketing and student admissions expenses at the schools added in and million 
general and administrative expense decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues in compared to as a result of a reduction of expenses incurred by the company s central staff organization 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by million  or  to million in from million in  as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
interest expense income  net the company had net interest income of  in as compared to interest expense of million in the lower interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average outstanding debt balance from million in to million in provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  the same as in  and differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due to expenses that are nondeductible for tax purposes 
net income net income increased by million or to million in from million in the increase resulted from improved operations at the company s schools owned prior to and reduced net interest expense  partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes 
year ended june  compared with year ended june  net revenues net revenues increased by to million in from million in the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in average quarterly student enrollments million and an average tuition price increase million at schools owned by edmc prior to  and the addition of two schools million 
the average academic year three academic quarters tuition rate for a student attending classes at an art institute on a recommended full schedule increased to  in from  in in august  the company acquired nyrs and in january  the company acquired lowthian college in minneapolis  minnesota and renamed it the art institutes international minnesota 
net housing revenues increased by to million in from million in and revenues from the sale of educational materials in increased by to million 
both are primarily the result of increased student enrollments 
refunds for increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of gross revenue  refunds remained consistent between years 
educational services educational services expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to incremental education expenses needed to service higher student enrollments  accompanied by normal cost increases for wages and other services at the schools owned by edmc prior to million and schools added in and million 
other factors that have contributed to the increase are expanded capital spending for culinary arts programs and classroom technology  and initiatives to improve student persistence rates and graduate starting salaries 
on an overall basis  as a percentage of net revenues  educational services expense in decreased by percentage point from the reduction is primarily the result of improved efficiencies at the company s more established schools due to economies of scale 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in due in large measure to the incremental increase in marketing and student admissions expenses that resulted in higher student enrollments at the schools owned by edmc prior to million  and additional marketing and student admissions expenses at the schools added since million 
during  additional expenses were incurred by the company s central staff organization that supports school operations because of the increased number of company owned schools and the growth in student enrollments 
general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in compared to as a result of the factors described above 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased by million  or  to million in from million in the higher expense in was primarily the result of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nyrs 
esop expense esop expense was zero in  down from million in  due to the repayment in of the final million of the esop term loan and the consummation of the ipo 
as a result  the company incurred no esop expense in related to the repayment of the esop term loan or the repurchase of shares 
interest expense net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the factors that contributed to lower interest expense are i a decrease in the average debt balance outstanding from million in to million in  and ii lower average interest rates on debt instruments 
the lower average debt balance is the result of the company repaying outstanding indebtedness million under the revolving credit agreement with proceeds from the ipo  the esop term loan being repaid as of june   and scheduled payments on capitalized leases 
in october  the company retired the entire million issue of its senior subordinated notes subordinated notes with borrowings under the revolving credit agreement which were at a lower rate of interest 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were at a weighted average interest rate of and during and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in the effective rate in fiscal was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to the tax deductible dividends on the series a preferred stock paid to the esop and used for esop term loan repayment 
in  tax deductible dividends of million offset approximately of the company s income before taxes  substantially reducing the company s effective tax rate 
income before extraordinary item income before extraordinary item increased by to million in from million in the higher income resulted from improved operations at the company s schools owned prior to  the addition of nyrs  lower esop expense and reduced net interest expense charges  partially offset by increased expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets and a higher provision for income taxes 
extraordinary item in  the company prepaid the entire million issue of the subordinated notes  resulting in a million net of tax prepayment penalty 
seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results the company s quarterly revenues and income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments 
the company experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall fiscal year second quarter  which is traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begin postsecondary education 
some students choose not to attend classes during summer months  although the company s schools encourage year round attendance 
as a result  total student enrollments at the company s schools are highest in the fall quarter and lowest in the summer months fiscal year first quarter 
the company s costs and expenses  however  do not fluctuate as significantly as revenues on a quarterly basis 
historically  edmc had experienced net losses in its fiscal first quarter ending september due to lower revenues combined with expenses incurred in preparation for the peak enrollments in the fall quarter  although the company had net income in the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that the seasonal pattern in revenues and earnings will continue in the future

liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company has generated positive cash flow from operations over the last three years 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the company had working capital of million as of june   as compared to million as of june  as of june   gross trade accounts receivable decreased by million  or  to million from million as of june  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in the allowance as a percentage of gross accounts receivable relates to greater flexibility in payment plans offered to students at the company s schools 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  increased by million  or  to million from million as of june  to a large degree  this was attributable to the completion of the company s integrated  customized information network in  whereby the company tracks accounts receivable for longer periods prior to write off 
debt service the revolving credit agreement  as amended  currently allows for maximum borrowings of million  reduced annually by million  through its expiration on october  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of three rates set forth in the revolving credit agreement at the election of the company 
the facility is reduced by certain outstanding letters of credit 
as of june   the company had million of additional borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain specified levels of consolidated net worth and meet specified interest and leverage ratio requirements  and restrict capital expenditures  declaration and payment of dividends on or repurchases of common stock and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 
the fourth amendment to the revolving credit agreement  dated june   revises certain provisions described above 
effective june   the interest rates and certain fees incurred in connection with borrowings and available borrowings were reduced 
additionally  the calculations of certain financial ratios were revised and restrictions on capital expenditures  dividends and operating leases were removed 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are used by the company primarily to fund its working capital needs  due to the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition and fees at the beginning of each academic quarter 
collection of these receivables is heaviest at the start of each academic quarter 
following the completion of the ipo in november  million of the net proceeds received by the company was used to repay indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
future financing and cash flows the company believes that cash flow from operations  supplemented from time to time by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned expansion to new locations  planned capital expenditures and debt service during the term of the revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures capital expenditures made during the three years ended june  have  in substantial part  resulted from the implementation of the company s initiatives emphasizing the addition of new schools and programs particularly culinary arts programs and investment in classroom technology 
the company s capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company anticipates increased capital spending for  principally related to the introduction and expansion of culinary arts programs  further investment in schools acquired or started during the previous three years  additional or replacement school and housing facilities and classroom technology 
as a percentage of net revenues  capital expenditures are expected to increase in compared to the company leases substantially all of its facilities 
future commitments on existing leases will be paid from cash provided by operating activities 
regulation the company indirectly derived approximately of its net revenues from title iv programs in us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in multiple disbursements each academic year 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter 
otherwise  the first loan disbursement is received  at the earliest  days before the commencement of the student s academic quarter 
us department of education regulations require title iv program funds received by the company s schools in excess of the tuition and fees owed by the relevant students at that time to be  with these students permission  maintained and classified as restricted until they are billed for the portion of their education program related to those funds 
funds transferred through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account and released when certain conditions are satisfied 
these restrictions have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
effective july  postsecondary education institutions became subject to changes in the delivery of ffel program proceeds 
prior to july  certain company owned schools delivered ffel proceeds for an academic year typically three quarters to students in two equal disbursements 
the change resulted in ffel proceeds being delivered equally in each of the academic quarters 
some of the company s schools began to deliver loan proceeds in this manner prior to the change in regulation becoming effective 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
under new regulations that took effect july   the us department of education adopted new standards replacing the former acid test ratio test  tangible net worth test and two year operating loss test to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three new ratios i the equity ratio  measuring an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  measuring an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  measuring an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
that composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
for the first year that the new financial responsibility regulations are in effect  which is for purposes of the company s schools  an institution that has a composite score of less than may elect to have its financial responsibility measured under the us department of education s former regulations 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of their total revenues from title iv programs in any year 
if an institution fails to meet any of these requirements  it may be deemed to be not financially responsible by the us department of education or otherwise ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
the company believes that all of its participating schools met these requirements as of june  effect of inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  were issued by the financial accounting standards board requiring implementation for years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
introduces a new model for segment reporting called the management approach 
the management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
in february  sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  was issued 
the implementation of sfas no 
will revise certain footnote disclosure requirements related to pension and other retiree benefits 
the company will adopt sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
in fiscal and does not anticipate that these statements will have a significant impact on its disclosures 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after june  year issues the problem the year problem arises from the fact that many existing information technology it hardware and software systems and non information technology non it products containing embedded microchip processors were originally programmed to represent any date with six digits eg   as opposed to eight digits eg  
accordingly  problems may arise for many such products and systems when attempting to process information containing dates that fall after december  as a result  many such products and systems could experience miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions 
additionally  such products and systems may experience miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions caused by other dates  such as september   which was a date traditionally used as a default date by computer programmers 
this problem is commonly referred to as the year problem  and the acronym yk is commonly substituted for the phrase year although the company is unable at this time to assess the possible impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition of any yk related disruptions to its business caused by the malfunctioning of any it or non it system and products that it uses or that third parties with which it has material relationships use  management does not believe at the current time that the cost of remediating the company s internal yk problems will have a material adverse impact upon its business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s state of readiness for its year issues as a result of the company s software upgrades and computer system purchases over the past few years  a substantial number of edmc s computer systems should not have a yk problem ie  are yk compliant or have been warranted to be yk compliant by third party vendors 
the company has created a task force the yk task force  which has members from the company s significant operating areas 
to date  the yk task force has implemented a program  the goal of which is to assess the potential exposure of each such area to the yk problem  which is the first phase of edmc s overall yk program  and  as the second phase thereof  has designed a coordinated plan to determine whether any such potential exposure would result in a problem that would require some remediation 
as each such area s yk problems are identified  the third phase will be to formulate proposals to determine the best course of action to address each such problem and to address each such problem  and contingency plans will be developed  to the extent possible and necessary 
the final phase of the overall yk program will be both independent and coordinated testing to ensure yk compliance in each operating area 
the company believes that the yk task force has identified all material it and non it systems owned or operated by edmc that require a yk compliance review 
to keep track of these and other developments  the yk task force has prepared a status report the yk status report  which will be updated on a periodic basis 
the yk status report tracks the identification of potential yk exposure for each significant operating area of edmc  the progress under the plan for each such area to determine and quantify the cost of fixing each actual yk problem  the status of the proposals to address each such problem and the development of compliance and contingency plans for each such area 
the yk status report is designed to function as both a framework for resolving edmc s yk issues and as a reporting mechanism for the company s board of directors 
the yk task force has the responsibility for addressing any yk problems in either it or non it systems 
the company s it systems  including its accounting  human resources  admissions  education  student financial services and student services systems  are in the assessment inventory phase 
this phase is expected to be completed by january  testing for yk compliance has been planned for each such system  and the yk task force projects that testing of edmc s most critical it systems will be substantially completed by mid calendar year the yk task force has substantially finished its identification of non it systems that may have yk problems and has sent inquiries to the entities that own or control any of those non it systems  including elevators  electricity  telephones  security systems and hvac systems  that could have a material impact on the company s operations  such as the owners of the buildings and other facilities that house or service the company s schools and administrative offices 
the yk task force has also identified those third parties  such as governmental and other regulatory agencies  guaranty agencies  software and hardware suppliers  telephone companies  significant vendors and external file exchange system providers  whose yk compliance or lack thereof may pose problems for the company 
pursuant to the yk task force s plan  inquiries have been sent to those third parties 
the yk task force estimates that it will receive initial responses to its inquiries from all such third parties by november  based on those responses and the responses to any follow up inquiries  the yk task force will refine the company s contingency plans that are currently in the formative stages 
the costs to address the company s year issues without including any allocation from the salaries of the relevant edmc personnel  the company has expensed approximately  to date in direct costs stemming from its efforts to address its yk issues 
this figure does not reflect the amounts spent in purchasing various new hardware and software products and systems in the past few years which are  or have been warranted to be  yk compliant 
based upon its current understanding of the company s yk issues  the yk task force s estimate for the direct costs of implementing its investigation and remediation plans is between  and  although additional information must be obtained to determine  for example  whether to recommend the replacement of older hardware and software systems or to expend the resources to bring those systems into yk compliance 
to the extent systems are to be replaced  yk related expenditures could significantly exceed the currently estimated range 
approximately of the currently estimated maximum amount represents funds that probably would have been used for system improvements over the next several years  even in the absence of yk issues 
of the estimated amount  approximately  will be used  if necessary  to replace computer hardware and software at company schools   is the amount estimated  if necessary  as the cost of installing new point of purchase terminals in the company s school supply stores and acquiring related hardware and software   will be used for a disaster drill on the company s primary internal software system   is budgeted for remediation of existing systems and training  and  is budgeted for contingency plan implementation  if necessary 
the company plans to charge its direct yk expenses to its information systems budget 
the cost of purchases  such as the  for new point of purchase terminals and the  allocated for hardware and software  are expected to be capitalized consistent with the company s accounting policies  all other expenditures will be expensed as incurred 
because a substantial portion of the yk task force s assessment work  relating primarily to the non it systems of certain third parties and the systems of other third parties with which the company has critical relationships  is in its preliminary phase  the estimate for direct costs may be materially increased 
risks related to the company s year issues the company has begun to outline several possible worst case scenarios that could arise because of yk issues  however  at this time  the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the likelihood of any of these worst case scenarios 
on the other hand  it should be noted that the company s schools will not be in session on december  or january   with classes resuming in mid january the company does expect to shift its focus and resources to the resolution of yk issues 
this will result in the deferral of some existing or contemplated projects  particularly computer system oriented projects 
although the company is unable at this time to quantify its internal  indirect costs resulting from such change in focus  with its resultant deferral of projects  management does not believe that the cost of remediating the company s internal yk problems will have a material adverse impact upon its business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
because the company is in a regulated industry and relies  indirectly  on only a few sources for a substantial portion of its revenues  edmc s business is very dependent upon those entities efforts to address their own yk issues 
the yk task force has identified those third parties whose failure to resolve their own yk issues could have a material impact upon the company s operations and is taking steps it currently believes appropriate to analyze both such parties yk status and the company s options in the event that any such party is not yk compliant in sufficient time prior to december  should any such third parties experience yk related disruptions  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
for example  as with all postsecondary education oriented businesses whose students receive governmental financial aid  the company s operations and liquidity depend upon the student funding provided by title iv programs for its students 
processing of applications for this funding is handled by the us department of education s computer systems 
the us department of education has stated that its systems will be yk compliant in early calendar year and that various schools will be able to run tests of the remediated systems during the first half of calendar year  however  the company is unable to independently assess the us department of education s progress to date and no test dates have been announced yet 
any problems with the us department of education s systems could result in an interruption in the funding for students nationwide  including the company s students 
any prolonged interruption would have a material adverse impact upon the education industry and  accordingly  upon the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
similarly  the company s schools are licensed by one or more agencies in the states in which they are based and accredited by one or more accrediting bodies that are recognized by the us department of education 
the company has begun to assess the yk readiness of these agencies and bodies  but such assessment is in its initial investigatory phase 
in the event that any of these entities are unable  due to yk problems  to renew a school s license or accreditation  an interruption in such school s operations could occur 
depending upon the school involved  a prolonged interruption could have a material adverse impact upon the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
five guaranty agencies provide the vast majority of the guarantees for the loans issued to the company s students under title iv programs 
the agency which accounts for the largest portion of those guarantees  approximately  has stated that it will be yk compliant by the second half of calendar year  and has said it will allow the company to run tests related thereto in october the company is investigating all these agencies to determine whether they will be yk compliant or whether contingency plans need to be made with respect thereto 
as with the us department of education  the company is unable to independently assess the readiness of any of these agencies at the present time 
the majority of the title iv program loans to the company s students are funded through six banks  five of which work with the company s primary guaranty agency 
the five lenders who work with that agency use an affiliate of that agency to disburse and service their loans  and thus during the guarantee agency s october testing program the company will indirectly test the yk compliance of that affiliate of the agency 
the company is exploring the availability of other lenders that have stated that they expect to be yk compliant as a contingency plan 
the company is also reviewing the yk compliance efforts of its transfer agent and the nasdaq national market system 
chasemellon shareholder services  the company s registrar and transfer agent  has told the company that the goal of its yk project is to be compliant by december   that it has already completed a comprehensive inventory of its mainframe systems  and that it is currently assessing  remediating and testing its software for yk compliance 
the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd  the parent company for the nasdaq national market system  is coordinating all yk activities for nasd related entities 
the nasd has publicly disclosed that it has analyzed all of its products and systems and launched its systems testing process in july the nasd also participated in industry wide beta testing conducted by the securities industry association  which was completed on july  industry wide testing will resume in march and april the yk task force plans to make inquiries of the major financial institutions and utilities that provide services to the company and is taking measures to assess the potential effects of those entities failures to become yk compliant within the time remaining 
if  notwithstanding any such entity s representations that it will be yk compliant in time  it is not compliant  the company s business and operations could be adversely affected 
contingency plans the yk task force s responsibilities include developing contingency plans for each of edmc s significant operating areas 
these contingency plans would be utilized in the event that  despite the company s best efforts  or due to the company s lack of control over certain third parties  a system is not yk compliant and edmc s business is adversely affected
