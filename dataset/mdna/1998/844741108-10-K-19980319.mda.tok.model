item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a record annual profit for the sixth consecutive year and a profit for the th consecutive year 
net income for benefited from record passenger revenue yields and continued cost control  widening our industry leading cost advantage 
at the end of  southwest served cities in states 
we added service to jacksonville  florida and jackson  mississippi in and have been very pleased with the results  thus far 
we also expanded our existing service to certain cities in  especially nashville  providence  and our florida markets 
plans for include the addition of more aircraft  net  and service to two new cities 
we will continue to add additional flights to cities we already serve 
any further expansion in will be dependent upon additional aircraft availability 
we were the launch customer for the new boeing aircraft  taking our first delivery in december the is expected to contribute to our low cost advantage as it is more fuel efficient  less maintenance intensive  and has a lower capital outlay than the we added new boeing s to our fleet in s and three s 
in  we are currently scheduled to receive s and retire eight older s three in first quarter  one in second quarter  and four in fourth quarter 
we currently are interested in adding more aircraft in if we can find aircraft at reasonable prices 
at the present time  boeing is experiencing production delays related to the production line 
thus far  these delays have not had a significant impact on our operations as we were able to defer the retirement of some older s and have earned cash penalty payments from boeing 
boeing currently expects delays to continue in  which temporarily delays our expansion 
boeing will continue to compensate southwest for these production delays 
in august  the taxpayer relief act of was enacted  which included  among other things  a revision of the then current ten percent federal excise tax on domestic tickets 
effective october   through september   the tax rate was reduced to nine percent of the amount paid for transportation beginning on or after october   and a new flight segment tax was imposed 
from october  to september   the tax rate will decrease to eight percent and the segment tax will increase to 
beginning october   the tax rate will change to percent of the ticket price 
the segment tax will increase to from october  to december   during  during  and per segment during thereafter  the segment tax will be indexed to changes in the consumer price index cpi 
the legislation also included a new tax on the sale of frequent flier miles  raised the international departure fee  and instituted a new international arrival fee 
management estimates these changes may increase southwest s tax burden by roughly million in as the effect of the new tax is to shift an increasing portion of the excise tax burden to low fare  shorthaul carriers such as southwest 
effective october   the company raised fares to offset the increased excise taxes 
while the fare increases mitigated the additional tax burden in fourth quarter  management cannot accurately predict the future effects of tax or fare increases 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  regulations implementing the tax  competitors responses to the tax  and the ability to pass through the tax in the form of fare increases 
on october   the international air transportation competition act of was amended to allow scheduled service from dallas love field to alabama  mississippi  and kansas 
the company now offers scheduled service from dallas love field to jackson via connecting flights through houston and service from dallas love field to birmingham via connecting flights through new orleans and houston 
no additional flights have been added  thus far  from dallas love field to alabama  mississippi  or kansas 
results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million per share  diluted  as compared to the corresponding amount of million 
per share  diluted  an increase of percent 
the prior years earnings per share amounts have been restated for the three for two stock split see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by percent in to  million  compared to  million for this increase in operating revenues was derived primarily from an percent increase in passenger revenues as a result of a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms and a percent increase in passenger revenue yield per rpm 
southwest s passenger revenues benefited from a strong us economy  strong demand for air travel  increased fares  and a favorable mix of higher yielding fares 
the percent increase in rpms in  coupled with a percent increase in available seat miles asms  resulted in a decrease in load factor from percent in to percent in the decrease in load factor was primarily the result of less promotional fare activity in the asm growth resulted from the addition of aircraft during the year 
the january load factor decreased to percent from percent in january due to heavy promotional fare activities in the period 
however  revenue yield per passenger mile continues to be strong in january despite difficult comparisons due to the lapse of the federal excise tax from january to march  comparisons in february and march will be more difficult due to fare increases in february the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  competitive pressure such as fare sales and capacity changes by other carriers  general economic conditions  and variations in advance booking trends 
freight revenues in were million  compared to million in the percent increase in freight revenues exceeded the percent increase in asms for the same period primarily due to an increase in united states mail services and increased air freight volumes resulting  in part  from the united parcel service labor strike during third quarter other revenues increased by percent in to million  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the sale of frequent flyer segment credits to participating partners in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to lower jet fuel prices  lower aircraft engine repair costs  and favorable results from numerous companywide cost reduction efforts 
unit costs are expected to benefit in first quarter  versus first quarter  from lower jet fuel prices 
excluding jet fuel costs  operating expenses per asm are expected to increase primarily due to higher maintenance costs as management believes first quarter maintenance unit costs will be higher than the same period in due to an unusually low number of aircraft engine overhauls performed in first quarter the immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices

salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent in this increase resulted primarily from a percent increase in average salary and benefits cost per employee  partially offset by slower growth in the number of employees 
the increase in average salary and benefits cost per employee primarily is due to increased health care costs 
the company s flight attendants are subject to an agreement with the transport workers union of america  afl cio twu  which became amendable may  the company reached an agreement with the twu  which was ratified by its membership in december the new contract becomes amendable in may the company s customer service and reservations sales agents are subject to an agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  afl cio iam  which became amendable in november and is currently under negotiation 
flight dispatchers are represented by the southwest airlines employees association  pursuant to an agreement which became amendable in november and is also currently under negotiation 
profitsharing and employee savings plans expense per asm increased percent in  primarily due to higher earnings available for profitsharing 
fuel and oil expenses per asm decreased percent in  primarily due to a percent decrease from in the average jet fuel cost per gallon  coupled with a slight decrease in the average fuel burn rate from the average price paid for jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in during fourth quarter  the average cost per gallon decreased percent to 
compared to 
in fourth quarter in january  fuel prices averaged approximately 
per gallon 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily as a result of lower engine overhaul costs in the first three quarters of  when compared to the same periods in on august   the company signed a ten year engine maintenance contract with general electric engine services  inc general electric 
under the terms of the contract  southwest will pay general electric a rate per flight hour in exchange for general electric performing substantially all engine maintenance for the cfm engines on the and aircraft 
the company has a similar agreement with general electric with respect to the engines on the aircraft 
maintenance on the pratt whitney jt d engines on the aircraft will continue to be performed by general electric on a time and materials basis 
by consolidating its engine repair work and committing to ten years  southwest believes it will spend substantially less over the course of the contract versus what it would have spent absent this new agreement 
the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results  such uncertainties include the number of unscheduled engine removals  labor rates  and competition in the engine overhaul market 
agency commissions per asm remained unchanged in  when compared to  as the mix of commissionable sales was relatively unchanged 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
depreciation expense per asm decreased percent in  compared to  due to an increase in the average life of depreciable assets 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent in  compared to  primarily due to lower credit card processing costs  insurance rates  passenger costs  communications costs  and favorable results from numerous other companywide cost reduction efforts 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and nonoperating gains and losses 
interest expense increased million in primarily due to the february issuance of million of senior unsecured debentures due march  capitalized interest decreased million in as a result of the timing of payments related to aircraft purchase contracts 
interest income for increased million primarily due to higher invested cash balances 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased in to percent from percent in the decrease resulted from lower effective state tax rates  including a reduced california income tax rate

per share  diluted  an increase of percent 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by percent in to  million  compared to  million for this increase in operating revenues was derived primarily from an percent increase in passenger revenues 
rpms increased percent in  compared to a percent increase in asms  resulting in an increase in load factor from percent in to percent in the asm growth resulted from the net addition of aircraft during the year additions and three retirements 
in december  because of the impasse in the federal budget  congress allowed the ten percent federal excise tax to lapse 
this benefited southwest s revenues until late august when congress reimposed the tax through december  the reimposition of the excise tax negatively impacted revenue trends in third and fourth quarters  as compared to revenue trends in the first half of in celebration of the company s th anniversary  southwest launched a fare sale in july for travel between august and october  the sale was extremely popular and resulted in record advance bookings  with more than four and a half million seats sold 
although july and early august load factors and revenues were negatively impacted by telephone line congestion experienced during the sale  revenues for september and october were positively impacted with very heavy passenger volumes 
freight revenues in were million  compared to million in the percent increase in freight revenues exceeded the percent increase in asms for the same period primarily due to increased air freight volumes and united states mail services 
other revenues increased by percent in to million  compared to million in this increase primarily was due to increased charter revenue 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for were  million  compared to  million in  an increase of percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm increased percent in compared to  primarily due to significantly higher jet fuel prices along with a cent per gallon federal jet fuel tax implemented october  excluding jet fuel costs and related taxes  operating expenses per asm were up percent in compared to salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent in this increase resulted primarily from a percent increase in average headcount  which outpaced the capacity asm increase of percent  and offset a 
percent decrease in average salary and benefits cost per employee 
the percent increase in average headcount primarily was the result of a percent increase in reservations sales agents in excluding reservations sales agents  total average headcount increased percent  in line with capacity 
fuel and oil expenses per asm increased percent in  primarily due to an percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon from the average price paid for jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in during fourth quarter  the average cost per gallon increased percent to 
compared to 
in fourth quarter maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent in  compared to  primarily as a result of increased scheduled airframe inspections during agency commissions per asm increased percent in  compared to  which was slightly slower than the percent increase in passenger revenues per asm 
landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent in  compared to  which included an airport credit of million 
depreciation expense per asm increased percent in  compared to  due to an increase in the percentage of owned aircraft 
other operating expenses per asm increased percent in  compared to this increase was primarily due to increased advertising costs resulting from the expansion into florida and providence  rhode island  as well as a new advertising campaign  the cent per gallon tax on commercial aviation jet fuel purchased for use in domestic operations  which became effective october   and increased airport security costs 
the additional fuel tax increased and other operating expenses by million and million  respectively 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and nonoperating gains and losses 
capitalized interest decreased million in as a result of certain amendments to aircraft purchase contracts during third quarter that affected the timing of payments 
interest income for increased million primarily due to higher invested cash balances 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased in to percent from percent in the decrease primarily was the result of lower effective state tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operations was million in  compared to million in operating cash flows in were inflated by million due to a one time deferral allowed by the federal government for payment of excise taxes 
on a pro forma basis  operating cash flows would have been million in versus million in during  additional funds of million were generated from the february issuance of million of senior unsecured debentures due march  these proceeds primarily were used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital 
during  capital expenditures of million primarily were for the purchase of new aircraft and three new aircraft along with progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
at december   capital commitments of the company primarily consisted of scheduled aircraft acquisitions and related flight equipment 
as of december   southwest had new s on firm order  including to be delivered in  with options to purchase another aggregate funding required for firm commitments approximated  million through the year  of which million related to see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company had authority from its board of directors to purchase up to  shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market 
no shares have been purchased since the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december   of million  internally generated funds  and a revolving credit line with a group of banks of up to million none of which had been drawn at december  
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of million of public debt securities  which it currently intends to utilize for aircraft financings in and market risk in  the securities and exchange commission issued new rules item of regulation s k  which require disclosure of material risks  as defined in item  related to market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as defined  southwest currently has market risk sensitive instruments related to jet fuel prices and interest rates 
airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and  therefore  are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices 
jet fuel consumed in represented approximately percent of southwest s operating expenses 
southwest endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest prevailing prices possible 
the company hedges its exposure to jet fuel price market risk only on a conservative  limited basis 
the fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments primarily purchased crude oil call options related to the company s jet fuel price market risk during and at december  was immaterial 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
airline operators are also inherently capital intensive  as the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize itself conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while southwest does use financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and a or equivalent credit ratings on its senior unsecured debt with three rating agencies standard poor s  moody s  and duff phelps 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has outstanding unsecured debt of million at december   of which only million is long term 
this long term debt represents only percent of total noncurrent assets at december  the company has an average maturity of years for the long term debt at fixed rates averaging percent  which is below average rates prevailing over the last ten years 
at december   the company operated aircraft under operating and capital leases at rates that are substantially fixed 
as defined in item  leases are not market risk sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its long term debt because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that have maturities of three months or less 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low  as the investments mature within three months 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other interest rate market risk management activities 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity a ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow as the interest rates on the company s long term debt are fixed and its cash investments are short term 
a ten percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s publicly traded long term debt or its short term cash investments 
impact of the year based on a recently completed assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify  upgrade  or replace significant portions of its internal software  including financial  reservations  maintenance  and human resources related software  so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  as of december   the company has commenced its year remediation program  has secured substantially all the required resources  and expects to substantially complete its internal year efforts by march  the company believes that by completing the planned remediation program  the year issue will not adversely impact the company s operations or operating results 
however  if the program is not completed  or not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  the company has contacted its critical suppliers and other entities to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
while the company has not been informed of any material risks associated with these entities  there is no guarantee that the systems of these critical suppliers or other entities  including the federal aviation administration  on which the company relies  will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems or operations 
the company has expensed million of costs incurred to date related to the year issue 
the total remaining cost of the year project is presently estimated at million  which will be expensed as incurred 
these amounts include only costs directly related to resolving the year issue 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes
