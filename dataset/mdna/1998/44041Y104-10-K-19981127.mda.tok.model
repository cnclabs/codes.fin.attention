item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a growing provider of employee assistance plans eap and mental health services to business and managed care organizations  as well as the leading contract manager of clinical programs offered by general acute care hospitals in the united states 
the company has grown both internally and through acquisitions  increasing both the variety of its treatment programs and services and the number of its management contracts 
as of august   the company had over contracts to provide eap and mental health services covering nearly million lives 
over the last six years  the company has increased its management contracts from to a total of as of august  and currently operates in states 
of those management contracts  relate to mental health programs and relate to physical rehabilitation programs 
the company has also developed a proprietary mental health outcomes measurement system known as cqi and at august  provided outcome measurement services at contract locations 
the company was incorporated in and is the successor to horizon health management company  which began the development and management of mental health programs for general acute care hospitals in the company s strategy is to enhance its position as the leader in the contract management of mental health programs and to further expand the range of services which it offers to its existing and new client hospitals to include other clinical and related services and programs 
a significant challenge in obtaining clinical management contracts from hospitals is overcoming the initial reservations that many hospital administrators have with outsourcing key clinical services 
the company believes its expertise in working with hospital administrators  its reputation in the industry and its existing contractual relationships with hospitals nationwide provide it with a significant advantage in obtaining new contracts 
the company also believes it has opportunities to cross sell a range of mental health and physical rehabilitation services to client hospitals by marketing and selling its mental health services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only physical rehabilitation programs  and by marketing and selling its physical rehabilitation services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only mental health programs 
the company is pursuing the development of such opportunities as a primary part of its business strategy 
the company has successfully expanded the breadth of services it offers to include the full continuum of mental health services  including outcome measurement services  and physical rehabilitation services and its contracts increasingly provide for multiple services 
in addition  the company capitalizes on its expertise in managing the delivery of mental health services by directly offering managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs to businesses and managed care organizations 
the company believes it is strategically sized to deliver national programs  while providing local  individualized service to both employer and health plan clients and their employees or clients 
revenues mental health services the primary factors affecting revenues in any period are the number of management contracts with treatment programs in operation in the period and the number of services covered by each such management contract 
the company provides its management services under contracts with terms generally ranging from three to five years 
each contract is tailored to address the differing needs of each client hospital and its community and increasingly cover multiple treatment programs and services 
the company and the client hospital determine the programs and services to be offered by the hospital and managed by the company  which may consist of one or more mental health or physical rehabilitation treatment programs offering inpatient  partial hospitalization  outpatient or home health services 
under the contracts  the hospital is the actual provider of the mental health or physical rehabilitation services and utilizes its own facilities including beds for inpatient programs  nursing staff and support services such as billing  dietary and housekeeping in connection with the operations of its programs 
as the company has expanded the breadth of treatment programs it offers to hospitals  it has moved from managing one treatment program under a single contract with a hospital to managing multiple treatment programs under such contract 
page contracts are frequently renewed prior to or at their stated expiration dates 
some contracts are terminated prior to their stated expiration dates pursuant to agreement of the parties or early termination provisions included in the contracts 
as of august   and  the company had successfully retained  and  respectively  of the management contracts in existence at the beginning of such fiscal years 
the company believes the most frequent reason its client hospitals do not renew their contracts with the company is that the hospitals decide to manage such programs themselves  the economic viability of the programs have changed resulting in their closing the programs  or a change in hospital administration results in a change in philosophy regarding the use of contract managers 
under each contract  the company receives a fee for its management services from the client hospital 
management fees may be either a variable fee related in part to patient volume  a fixed monthly fee or reimbursement for direct program costs plus a fixed fee 
the management fee is frequently subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes in the consumer price index or other economic factors 
payors  including medicare and medicaid  are attempting to manage costs  resulting in declining amounts paid or reimbursed to hospitals for the services provided 
as a result  the company anticipates that the number of patients served by general acute care hospitals on an inpatient basis will decrease and  as an alternative  the number of patients served on a per diem  episodic or capitated basis will increase in the future 
over the past three years  the company has increased revenues through acquisitions discussed below and through internal growth by adding services  price escalators and volume increases at existing contract locations 
the increases have primarily been due to the increased range of services offered per contract and the increased demand for geropsychiatric services as general hospitals have sought to enter this market 
an additional factor in the pricing strategy has been the company s policy of establishing a minimum direct margin threshold for its management contracts 
because the pooling with specialty occurred on august   fiscal margins do not reflect the integration or the elimination of specialty s executive  administrative  accounting and personnel functions and information systems  the closing of two specialty office facilities and other synergies 
the company s mix of programs has changed over the last three years reflecting the increased interest in geropsychiatric programs by general hospitals 
geropsychiatric programs as a percentage of the company s total mental health programs have increased from approximately to during that period 
most of the company s client hospitals receive reimbursement under one or more of the medicare or medicaid programs for mental health and physical rehabilitation services provided in programs managed by the company 
the company is paid directly by its client hospitals for the management services it provides 
under many of its management contracts the company is obligated to refund all or a portion of its fee if either medicare denies reimbursement to the client hospital for individual patient treatment or if the fee paid to the company is denied by medicare as a reimbursable cost 
during the fiscal years ended august  and  the company refunded approximately  and  respectively  of its fees as a result of these denials 
recent amendments to the medicare regulations established maximum reimbursement amounts on a per case basis for both inpatient mental health and physical rehabilitation services 
effective as of october   regulations promulgated pursuant to these amendments establish a ceiling on the rate of increase in operating costs per case for mental health and physical rehabilitation services furnished to medicare beneficiaries 
prior to these amendments  the reimbursement amounts were tied to each hospital s mental health or physical rehabilitation unit cost during such unit s first year of operations  subject to adjustment 
the new regulations establish a nationwide cap limiting the reimbursement target amount on a per case basis for mental health and physical rehabilitation services to  and  respectively  subject to adjustments based on market indices 
the limitations have resulted  in some cases  in decreased amounts reimbursed to the company s client hospitals 
this decrease in reimbursement has  in some cases  led to the renegotiation of a lower contract management fee structure for the company and in other cases has resulted in termination or nonrenewal of the management contract 
the new reimbursement limitations become applicable to the client hospitals at the beginning of their respective medicare fiscal years 
the trend of renegotiated fees and canceled or nonrenewed contracts  resulting in reduced management fees  which the company first encountered in its fiscal second quarter  can be expected to continue in the first and second quarters of fiscal page a recently enacted amendment to the medicare statutes provides for a gradual phase out of cost based reimbursement for physical rehabilitation services over a three year period commencing on october  the resulting phase in of reimbursement for physical rehabilitation services based on pps could significantly lower medicare reimbursements to hospitals and thus have a material adverse effect on the business  operations and financial results of the company
