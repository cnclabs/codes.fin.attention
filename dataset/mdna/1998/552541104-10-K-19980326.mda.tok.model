impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed a preliminary assessment and plans to modify or replace portions of the software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost is not expected to be significant and will be expensed as incurred 
to date  the company has not incurred significant expenses relating to the year issue 
the project is estimated to be completed no later than december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
based on the company s preliminary assessment  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the company does not believe that the year issue will have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could materially differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
tax matters in connection with the abex merger and the transfer  mcg and the company entered into a tax sharing agreement 
under the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement and with respect to periods ending on or prior to june   mcg will generally be required to pay any tax liabilities of the company  except for foreign income taxes related to aerospace 
at december   the company had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in years through other the company is indemnified by third parties with respect to certain environmental and asbestos matters  as well as certain tax and other matters 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial position to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of indemnitors failing to satisfy their obligations is remote 
for a discussion of certain indemnification obligations to the company  see item business corporate indemnification matters 
foreign exchange most of the company s export sales and purchase of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several european currencies as well as the us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
inflation prior to  mafco worldwide had historically been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto customers through price increases 
since  inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs have not been significant 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on future cost increases to its customers
