rate volume analysis of net interest income the effect of changes in average balance and rate from the corresponding prior period on interest income  interest expense and net interest income for the years ended december  and is set forth below 
the effect of a change in average balance has been determined by applying the average rate for the earlier period to the change in average balance for the later period  as compared with the earlier period 
the effect of a change in the average rate has been determined by applying the average balance for the earlier period to the change in average rate for the later period  as compared with the earlier period

total interest expense of  for was  or higher than an increase of  in total interest bearing liabilities is the primary reason for this increase  resulting in an additional  of interest expense for as compared to interest expense increased an additional  due to an increase in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was  an increase of basis points from in the funding of asset growth through an increase in relatively higher costing time deposits as well as the addition of higher costing short term and long term borrowings contributed to the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities for tax equivalent net interest income for was  an increase of  or from  for  primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing more than the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities 
however  the net interest spread on a tax equivalent basis declined basis points to for compared to for  and the net interest margin  which is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets  declined basis points to for compared to for this reflects the fact that the growth of interest earning assets outpaced the growth in net interest income  resulting from the use of higher costing time deposits as well as short term and long term borrowings to fund the growth of average interest earning assets 
total tax equivalent interest income of  for represents an increase of  or over total tax equivalent interest income of  for this improvement is primarily due to an increase of  in the average balance of interest earning assets for as compared to the largest increase in average balances is reflected in total investment securities  for which the average balance of  for is  higher than the average balances of total loans and federal funds sold for as compared to increased  and  respectively 
the overall increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets contributed an additional  to total tax equivalent interest income for as compared to however  this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in total tax equivalent interest income for as compared to  resulting from a decline of basis points in the average rate earned on interest earning assets

the company s home equity loan portfolio which is included in real estate mortgages in the table above and a substantial portion of its commercial loan portfolio have interest rates that reprice with changes in the prime rate 
allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at an amount considered adequate by management and the board of directors to provide for potential credit losses based upon a periodic evaluation of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
management and the board of directors of the company review the allowance for possible loan losses on a regular basis 
management and the board evaluate a number of factors in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
weakening credits are evaluated individually and factors such as the creditworthiness of the borrower  the adequacy of underlying collateral and the probable impact of business and economic conditions upon the borrower are examined 
the review process also takes into consideration the possibility that there may be losses in the loan portfolio which cannot currently be identified  and the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the volume of non performing and other classified loans and their relationship to the loan portfolio  as well as historical charge off experience  are also examined

this loan had previously been restructured and was being reported by the company as a restructured loan and a non performing asset 
this loan was performing in accordance with its restructured terms until october of  at which time the company noted a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower sufficient to create doubt as to the collectibility of the remaining outstanding loan balance and resulting in the loan being charged off 
the allowance for possible loan losses includes an allocation for all loans classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss see asset quality below for definitions of such classifications 
after allocating the allowance for classified loans  an allocation is made for all non classified loans 
the allocation for non classified loans is made by loan category  based upon the historical loss experience for each loan category as well as perceived risk of loss for each loan category 
the amount of the allowance applicable to non classified loans was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
since these factors are subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses should not be interpreted as an indication that such amounts or proportions will continue or indicate future trends 
the specific amount of the allowance in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the company considers the entire reserve to be available to absorb losses in any category

individual loan officers are assigned to monitor non installment and non residential mortgage loans and are responsible for the periodic updating of their reviews of such loans 
loan officers are actively encouraged to identify potential deteriorating loan situations through a self reporting system 
installment and residential mortgage loans are primarily monitored through an analysis of their payment status 
classified loan reports are prepared and reviewed regularly by the problem loan committee 
classified loans are placed into one of several categories  depending upon the condition of the borrower and the strength and amount of collateral 
classifications consist of special mention loans  defined as loans with only modest deficiencies in documentation and with potentially weakening credit features  substandard loans  defined as loans that have a well defined credit weakness  doubtful loans  defined as loans that have a significantly higher probability of loss than substandard loans  and loss loans which are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible 
non performing assets consist of i non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and loans past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but not placed on non accrual status  ii loans that have been restructured due to a weakening in the financial position of the borrower restructured loans and iii other real estate owned oreo  net of reserves

the decline of  in restructured loans during is primarily due to the chargeoff of a single loan in the amount of  as previously discussed under allowance for possible loan losses 
it is the company s general policy to discontinue the accrual of interest and reverse previously accrued but unpaid interest as to a particular loan when interest or principal is more than days past due on such loan or other circumstances indicate that full collection is questionable  unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 
income on non accrual loans is recognized only in the period in which it is collected

a loan loss reserve has been allocated to such loans in accordance with the company s policies 
in the course of resolving non performing loans  the bank may restructure the contractual terms of its loans with its borrowers 
if  prior to such restructuring  the loan was classified as non accrual  it is the bank s policy to continue to carry these restructured loans on non accrual status for a period of time typically six months before management considers their return to accrual status

the company does not have trading securities 
it classifies its securities holdings between held to maturity and available for sale 
the accounting standard provides a different accounting treatment for each category 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase 
if management has the positive intent and the company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity  they are classified as held to maturity securities 
such securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts 
securities in the available for sale category are those for which the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity

company obligated mandatorily redeemable cumulative trust preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the company cumulative trust preferred securities 
on june   million of cumulative trust preferred securities were issued by bnb capital trust  a delaware statutory business trust formed and wholly owned by bancorporation 
the net proceeds from this issuance were invested in bancorporation in exchange for bancorporation s junior subordinated debentures

the bank obtains cash from customers in the form of interest and principal payments on loans  fees paid for services  and from new deposits 
investment maturities also provide a source of cash 
many different measurements of liquidity are used in the banking industry 
the ratios of cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold and short term securities to total assets and net loans to total deposits are among some of the more commonly used indicators 
these measurements are set forth below as of december  and dec 
 dec 
 cash and cash equivalents and securities maturing in one year to total assets net loans to total deposits the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by  primarily to fund growth in the loan and securities portfolios 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for  representing primarily the results of operations adjusted for depreciation  amortization and the provision for possible loan losses 
net cash used in investing activities was  which was used primarily to fund the growth in the loan and the securities portfolio 
net cash provided by financing activities was  reflecting increases in short term and long term debt  the issuance of cumulative trust preferred securities and increases in deposits  partially offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders and the purchase of treasury stock 
to assist in the management of its liquidity  the bank had available  in lines of credit for overnight borrowing with correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank  which lines were not in use at december  managing the bank s liquidity position involves a significant degree of analytical estimation and other objective factors 
although customer demand for funds  in the form of loans or deposit withdrawals  is largely dependent on general economic factors outside of the bank s control  management believes that its present liquidity structure is adequate to meet such needs 
liquidity of bancorporation bancorporation s ability to meet its cash requirements  including dividend payments  is generally dependent upon the declaration and payment of dividends by the bank to bancorporation 
under federal law  the approval of the comptroller of the currency is required for the payment of dividends in any calendar year by broad national bank to broad national bancorporation if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the net income for that year combined with the retained net income for the preceding two calendar years 
as of december   retained earnings of the bank of  are available for payment of dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval 
additionally  at december   bancorporation had available  of cash and interest bearing balances with banks for the purpose of paying future dividends  interest and operating costs 
however  a change in circumstances  such as changes in regulatory requirements or in the bank s financial condition  could result in bancorporation being required by regulatory authorities to utilize its funds to increase the bank s capital 
in such event  bancorporation may not have sufficient cash for operations or to make interest or dividend payments and may be required to seek other sources of capital and liquidity  if available 
market risk the company does not have assets held for trading purposes  and does not currently use derivatives to manage market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the company s asset liability committee 
tools used by the asset liability committee to monitor interest rate risk include the gap report and an interest rate shock simulation report see interest rate sensitivity 
the table below represents in tabular form the contractual balances of the company s on balance sheet financial instruments  categorized by expected maturity dates  and the instruments fair values at december  expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for repayments  and  where prepayment information is available  prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
expected maturities for loans reflect contractual maturities adjusted for projected scheduled repayments 
investment securities reflect contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments  which prepayments reflect the most recent three month prepayment speeds 
deposits  other than time deposits  reflect decay rates based upon industry accepted assumptions 
time deposits  short term borrowings  long term debt and cumulative trust preferred securities reflect contractual maturities 
the fair value of federal funds sold approximates book value due to the short maturity 
the fair value of investment securities is based on quotations from security dealers 
the fair value of loans are estimated using the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be received using estimated market discount rates 
the fair value of savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts is the amount payable upon demand 
the fair value of time deposits is based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining terms 
the fair value of short term borrowings and long term debt is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity based upon current rates offered for similar instruments with similar maturities 
the fair value of the cumulative trust preferred securities is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity based upon current rates for similar trust preferred securities

interest rate sensitivity management of interest rate sensitivity involves matching the maturity and repricing dates of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities in an effort to reduce the impact of fluctuating net interest rates on net interest margins and to promote consistent growth of net interest income during periods of changing interest rates 
the company s asset liability committee the committee meets regularly to establish  communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management procedures 
the purpose of the committee is to monitor the volume and mix of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities consistent with the company s overall liquidity  capital  growth  risk and profitability goals 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches ie  the interest sensitivity gap between the dollar amount of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities  and is measured in terms of the ratio of the interest rate sensitivity gap to total assets 
more assets repricing or maturing than liabilities over a given time period is considered asset sensitive and is reflected as a positive gap  and more liabilities repricing or maturing than assets over a given time period is considered liability sensitive and is reflected as a negative gap 
an asset sensitive position ie  a positive gap will generally enhance earnings in a rising interest rate environment and will negatively impact earnings in a falling interest rate environment  while a liability sensitive position ie  a negative gap will generally enhance earnings in a falling interest rate environment and negatively impact earnings in a rising interest rate environment 
fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable 
the table below indicates as of december  the time period in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are scheduled to mature or reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
after after after three six one three through through through months six twelve five after or less months months years five years total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets investment securities      loans       federal funds sold   total interest sensitive assets       interest sensitive liabilities savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts      time deposits      short term borrowings     long term debt   cumulative trust preferred securities   total interest sensitive liabilities sensitivity gap       gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative sensitivity gap      cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative sensitivity ratio at december   the company had a one year cumulative negative gap of 
this negative one year gap position may  as noted above  have a negative impact on earnings in a rising interest rate environment 
this interest sensitivity table is not a complete picture of the possible effect of interest rate changes on net interest income for various reasons  among them the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year  changes in the general level of interest rates will not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously  and the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
additionally  the calculation of these interest sensitivity gap positions involves certain assumptions as to the repricing period of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these gap positions are significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the prepayments of loans and investment securities as well as to the repricing of deposit accounts 
the significant assumptions used in the above table include fixed rate loans reflect contractual maturities adjusted for projected scheduled repayments  investment securities reflect contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments on mortgage backed securities  which prepayments reflect the most recent three month prepayment speeds  deposits  other than time deposits  reflect decay rates based upon industry accepted assumptions  and time deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt reflect contractual maturities 
the impact of actual repayments  repricings and changes in interest rates may differ from that indicated in the table above 
consequently  these static measurements are best used as early indicators of potential interest rate exposure 
the company also uses simulation modeling techniques which apply alternative interest rate scenarios to forecasts of future business activity 
the results of such simulation modeling techniques may differ from the implications derived from the interest sensitivity gap analysis  and the use of such simulation modeling techniques provides further assistance to management in its efforts to achieve earnings growth in varying interest rate environments 
the company currently does not use derivatives to manage interest rate risk

sfas does not require a specific format for that financial statement but requires that an enterprise display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in that financial statement 
sfas requires that an enterprise a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position

a steering committee comprised of senior management has been formed to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to this project and to monitor the progress and testing of the year transition 
the bank s primary computer applications are handled by an outside processor 
to date  the bank has received confirmation that this processor has developed a plan of action for the testing and implementation of year enhancements 
the bank will use internal resources to identify and test all vendor applications for year compliance

except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including risks and uncertainties associated with quarterly fluctuations in results  the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income  the quality of the bank s loans and other assets and the credit risk associated with lending activities  the fluctuations in the general economic and real estate climate in the bank s primary market area of new jersey  the impact of competition from other banking institutions and financial service providers and the increasing consolidation of the banking industry  the enforcement of federal and state bank regulations and the effect of changes in such regulations  and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports 
actual results may vary materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements herein 
factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business in order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  added to those acts by the private securities litigation reform act of  bancorporation is hereby identifying important risks and uncertainties that could affect bancorporation s actual results of operations  financial condition or business and could cause bancorporation s actual results of operations  financial condition or business to differ materially from its historical results of operations  financial condition or business  or the results of operations  financial condition or business contemplated by forward looking statements made herein or elsewhere orally or in writing  by  or on behalf of  bancorporation 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors described below 
economic conditions in bancorporation s primary market area the profitability of bancorporation is dependant on the profitability of its subsidiary  broad national bank  which is a national banking association operating out of new jersey 
the bank s financial condition is affected by fluctuations in the economic conditions prevailing in that portion of new jersey in which the bank s banking operations are located 
accordingly  the financial conditions of both the bank and bancorporation would be adversely affected by deterioration in the general economic and real estate climate in the state of new jersey 
the bank s business is also subject to fluctuations in interest rates  national and local economic conditions  monetary and regulatory policies and consumer and institutional confidence in the bank 
the fluctuations are neither predictable nor controllable and may have materially adverse consequences upon the operations and financial condition of the bank and bancorporation in the future even if other favorable events occur 
importance of net interest income and susceptibility to changes in interest rates the primary source of earnings for the bank and bancorporation is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
there may be a difference between the amount of interest earning assets scheduled to reprice in any given period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities scheduled to reprice over the same time 
any difference can create a lag between the time it takes the rate the bank earns interest to respond to market fluctuations and the time it takes the rate the bank incurs interest costs to respond to market fluctuations  and vice versa 
because of these interest sensitivity gaps  the amount of net interest income may be affected by fluctuations in the interest rate 
asset quality and lending risks success in the banking industry largely depends on the quality of loans and other assets 
the bank s loan officers are actively encouraged to identify deteriorating loans 
loans are also monitored and categorized through an analysis of their payment status 
the bank s failure to timely and accurately monitor the quality of its loans and other assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the bank and bancorporation 
there is a degree of credit risk associated with any lending activity 
bancorporation attempts to minimize its credit risk through loan diversification 
although bancorporation s loan portfolio is varied  with no undue concentration in any one industry  substantially all of the loans in the portfolio have been made to borrowers in new jersey 
therefore  the loan portfolio is susceptible to factors affecting the new jersey area and the level of non performing assets is heavily dependant upon local conditions 
see economic conditions in bancorporation s primary market area 
there can be no assurance that the level of bancorporation s non performing assets will not increase above current levels 
high levels of non performing assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the bank and bancorporation 
provisions for possible loan losses bancorporation makes a provision for possible loan losses based upon management s analysis of potential losses in the loan portfolio and consideration of prevailing economic conditions 
bancorporation may need to increase the provision for loan losses through additional provisions in the future if the financial condition of any of its borrowers deteriorates or if real estate values decline 
see asset quality and lending risks 
furthermore  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review bancorporation s loan portfolio  provision for loan losses  in substance foreclosed loans  and real estate acquired by foreclosure 
such agencies may require  and in the past have required  bancorporation to recognize additions to the provision for loan losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of the examination 
any additional provisions for possible loan losses  whether required as a result of regulatory review or initiated by bancorporation itself  may materially alter the financial outlook of the bank and bancorporation 
competition in bancorporation s market area vigorous competition exists in all major areas where bancorporation and the bank presently engage in business 
the bank faces intense competition in local and national markets from other major banking institutions 
the bank is in direct competition with some larger institutions that have substantially greater resources  better name recognition  stronger market presence  and the ability to offer a wider range of services 
competition from larger institutions is especially prevalent due to the accelerated pace of bank mergers in the new jersey area 
the long term impact of such mergers and consolidations on the new jersey market area is uncertain 
the bank may face even more intense competition because of the proliferation of bank mergers 
an increase in the intensity of competition from other banks in the new jersey market could have a materially adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the bank and bancorporation 
in addition to the competition from rival banking companies  the bank faces competition from non bank institutions including finance companies  mortgage lenders  small loan companies  credit unions  insurance companies  and a variety of other financial service and advisory companies 
the stock market  mutual funds  and other non federally insured investments also compete with the bank for customer deposits 
the bank may face more intense competition from these and other non banking industries and investments in the future 
a failure of the bank to be competitive could have a materially adverse effect on the bank and bancorporation 
regulation banks and bank holding companies such as bancorporation are subject to regulation by both federal and state bank regulatory agencies 
the regulations  which are designed to protect borrowers and promote certain social policies  include limitations on the operations of banks and bank holding companies  such as minimum capital requirements and restrictions on dividend payments 
these regulations are not necessarily designed to maximize the profitability of banking institutions 
future changes in the banking laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the bank and bancorporation 
importance of executive officers the success of the bank and bancorporation has been largely dependant on the efforts of donald karp  john dorman and the other executive officers 
these individuals are expected to continue to perform their services 
however  the loss of the services of donald karp  john dorman  or any of the other key executive officers could have a materially adverse effect on the bank and bancorporation 
year compliance the company s year steering committee has been designated to monitor the progress and testing of the action plan for year compliance  with the objective of ensuring that all computerized systems and software programs are capable of functioning in the next century 
the company anticipates that the incremental cost of ensuring that its computer systems are year compliant may be significant but is not anticipated to be material to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a materially adverse effect on the bank and the company 
additional factors additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of operations  financial condition or business of the bank and bancorporation include  but are not limited to i the ability to keep pace with technological change including developing and implementing technological advances timely and cost effectively in order to provide better service and remain competitive  ii adverse publicity  news coverage by the media  or negative reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts regarding the bank or bancorporation  and iii changes in accounting policies and practices
