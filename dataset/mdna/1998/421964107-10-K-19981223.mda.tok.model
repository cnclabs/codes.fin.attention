item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in july to provide managed care information systems software to health care organizations that use managed care techniques to deliver services  manage financial risk and control costs 
since inception  the company has invested substantially all of its operating cash flow in product and business development 
the company introduced its first internally developed product  diamond tm in fiscal  followed by diamond tm c s in fiscal the company s revenues to date have been derived from licensing the diamond tm products  fees from customers for enhancements to the diamond tm products  providing the associated implementation  support and consulting services  and  to a lesser extent  reselling third party software and hardware 
software licenses have been granted on a perpetual basis and multi year  term basis 
license fees are determined according to the number of users licensed or the number of members processed by the customer 
hsd requires each of its direct customers to enter into a minimum month support contract with the company 
from time to time  customers request that the company provide third party hardware in connection with system sales 
such sales of third party hardware accounted for   and of the company s total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that license fee and service revenues associated with diamond tm and diamond tm c s will account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company s financial performance will depend largely on the continued growth in demand for operational managed care information systems and the tools to implement such systems 
effective october   the company generally recognizes diamond tm license revenue upon shipment of the software to end users  as no significant production or customization of this software is required  and the installation period is relatively short 
the company generally recognizes diamond tm c s license revenue on a percentage of completion basis based on the labor hours required to implement the system  as this software generally requires an extended installation period and can require significant enhancements 
if the software license agreement provides for acceptance criteria that extend beyond the published specifications of the applicable product  then revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
the length of the implementation process depends on factors outside of the company s control  including customers ability to allocate internal resources to the installation process and  with respect to certain customers  the need to obtain necessary governmental approvals 
implementation and support fees are billed either on an hourly or monthly basis and are recognized as services are rendered 
third party software and hardware fees are typically billed and recognized as revenues when delivered to the customer 
the revenue on a particular diamond tm c s system sale will be recognized over the implementation period which may be over a year 
thus  the company s ability to make individual system sales in a particular period will significantly impact its financial performance in future periods 
as the company has pursued larger diamond tm c s system sales  it has seen and expects to continue to see variability in the recognition of system sales revenue 
significant portions of system revenues in the last two quarters of fiscal resulted from license sales executed in prior periods 
substantially all of the company s license agreements may be terminated under certain circumstances 
the termination of license agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  the company is unable to predict accurately the amount of revenues it expects to recognize from license fees in any particular period 
subsequent to september   blue cross blue shield of north carolina ceased implementation of the diamond tm c s product 
this contract accounted for of the company s total revenues for the fiscal year ended september  the cessation of implementation did not have an impact on the company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended september  in fiscal  the company entered into a marketing agreement with sms 
pursuant to this agreement  sms was granted software licenses for resale at a stated price 
for these licenses  the company recognizes diamond tm license fees when a diamond tm contract between sms and the end user is executed  and recognizes diamond tm c s license fees upon successful implementation of the system at the site of an sms end user 
for term license agreements  the company recognizes revenues ratably over the term of the license agreement between sms and the end user  which term typically extends five to seven years 
for those licenses after the first licenses under the original agreement  sms pays the company a percentage of the license fee charged to its end users 
sms must also pay hsd a percentage of all support fees paid to sms by its end users 
the sms relationship accounted for less then   and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
because of the amendment to the sms agreement  as described in item relationship with shared medical systems  revenues from sms are expected to be negligible in the near future  until the credit pool is exhausted 
the company capitalizes software costs for internally developed software 
these costs relate primarily to the development of either new products or significant enhancements to existing products which enable the products to penetrate new markets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on the company s product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model or  in the case of major releases  detailed program design 
the capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives not exceeding three years  commencing when each product or significant enhancement is available to the market

in fiscal  diamond tm c s accounted for a significant portion of system sales revenues 
the company expects that diamond tm c s will continue to represent a significant portion of systems sales revenues over the next several years due to the higher systems sales revenues per customer associated with sales of diamond tm c s 
as a result  the company s financial performance will depend largely on the market acceptance of diamond tm c s

cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues is dependent upon the mix of license  service and third party software and hardware revenues and may fluctuate over time 
during fiscal  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was higher due to costs related to the sms amendment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal management decided to revise its expense classifications to be more consistent with industry standards 
this decision resulted in certain product engineering costs being included in product development instead of costs of revenues 
costs associated with implementation  customer support  amortization of capitalized software and third party hardware and software continue to be classified as cost of revenues 
all prior periods in this filing have been reclassified on the same basis 
operating expenses general and administrative

the company capitalized   and  in product development costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
product development expenses primarily include the salaries and benefits associated with the product development staff as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
as mentioned above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal management decided to revise its expense classifications to be more consistent with industry standards 
this decision resulted in certain product engineering costs being included in product development instead of cost of revenues 
costs associated with implementation  customer support  amortization of capitalized software and third party hardware and software continue to be classified as cost of revenues 
all prior periods in this filing have been reclassified on the same basis 
product development expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years ended september   and were  and  respectively 
interest  net interest income  net of interest expense  was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest income was the result of the cash proceeds from the initial public offering completed in march the decrease in interest income  net of expense  was primarily due to a decrease in cash reserves invested

effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
the tax provision for fiscal was mainly the result of taxes withheld by foreign authorities for income the company earned in their jurisdiction 
for financial reporting purposes  a valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the deferred tax assets recognized under sfas no 
because the company has historically not achieved significant levels of profitability  and there is inherent uncertainty as to when the company will achieve sustained profitability

liquidity and capital resources in march  the company completed an initial public offering of its common stock  raising  net of expenses 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable  unbilled revenues and prepaid expenses  partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities 
net cash used in operations in fiscal consisted primarily of a net loss and an increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase in accounts payable and accruals and depreciation and amortization 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the reduced operating loss as compared to prior periods  as well as by an increase in unearned revenue 
depreciation and amortization and the increase in unbilled revenue in effectively offset each other 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  and consisted primarily of acquisitions of computer equipment and furniture  as well as the capitalization of software development costs 
the investment in computer equipment and furniture was directly related to the increase in the number of employees and the acquisition of computers for software development 
cash used for capitalized software development costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of an increase in overall development activities associated with major releases 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
financing activities consisted primarily of  in notes and an initial public offering of the company s common stock in fiscal  and proceeds from exercise of common stock options by employees in fiscal and as of september   and  the company had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of   and  respectively 
the company believes that available funds and cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for at least the next months 
year issues state of readiness because many computer programs and embedded computer chips are unable to distinguish between the year and the year  the company has executed a plan to analyze  and if necessary  correct problems which may occur as a result of the year date change 
the year project the project began by categorizing potential issues into four groups the company s software developed for sale diamond tm c s and diamond tm  the company s internal systems and networks  third party software and hardware sold by the company  and customer systems and equipment  other than that sold and or licensed by the company 
the project for diamond tm c s and diamond tm began early in fiscal as a result of the company s analysis and testing  the company believes the most current releases of diamond tm software products are year compliant 
the company defines the term year compliant to mean that the software will not a cease to perform due solely to a change in date to or after january   nor b generate incorrect or ambiguous data or results with respect to same century and or multi century formulas  functions  date values  and date data interfaces 
the company continues to further validate current products  new releases for such products  as well as new products  and releases through testing and code reviews 
the company offers new releases at no charge to customers who are under current support agreements 
other customers may request and pay a fee for new releases 
the company s internal systems and networks have been inventoried and inquiries were made of each vendor 
substantially all systems  including hardware  development tools  and software used in the company s information systems are year compliant 
for the products that are not currently year compliant the vendors have put plans into effect to correct their product before the end of calendar year third party software and hardware which is sold by the company has been inventoried and inquiries were made of each vendor 
with a few exceptions  all third party software and hardware are year compliant 
for the products that are not currently year compliant the vendors have put plans into effect to correct their product before the end of calendar year during the current fiscal year  the company communicated its state of readiness to address year issues to its clients 
clients were also notified of the company s ability to correct any issues associated with a year problem in the company s software 
clients were also informed that their other hardware and software systems may have unresolved issues relating to the year problem which may adversely affect the operation of the company s diamond tm software  even though the company has resolved its own problems 
costs to address the issues as of september   the company had not separately tracked costs related to the year problem  since the analysis phase for the company s diamond tm software coincided with the testing and quality assurance phase of the company s general releases 
however  based on an estimate of the amount of time incurred by the company s analysis team  costs related to the year problem have  to date  not been material and have not been capitalized by the company 
although the company believes that its products are year compliant  it is continuing its testing and analysis program 
any remaining costs related to the year problem are not expected to be material for the diamond tm software 
projected costs for the company s internal systems and networks  third party software and hardware sold by the company  and customer systems and equipment  other than that sold and or licensed by the company are also not expected to be material 
risks of the company s year issues the company s year project is ongoing 
the company s and its client s normal business activities and operations could be adversely affected by the year problem 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of its clients  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of the potential year failure s would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
if the company s diamond tm products  its internal systems or its clients systems fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year problem then the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
contingency plan the company does not currently have a contingency plan in place 
should there be year problems still remaining in the company s software developed for sale diamond tm c s and diamond tm  the company s internal systems and networks  third party software and hardware sold by the company  and customer systems and equipment  other than that sold and or licensed by the company  the company intends to prioritize requests  based on severity  and correct the related problem 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of statements in this report concerning the future results of operations  financial condition and business of the company are forward looking statements as defined in the securities act of and the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that information contained in these forward looking statements is inherently uncertain  and that actual performance and results may differ materially due to numerous risk factors  including but not limited to the following  as well as other risks which are described herein and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission risk factors management of growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  technical  financial and other resources 
the company s growth has resulted in an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company has sought to manage its current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management  sales and marketing and technical personnel  and through continued enhancement of internal systems and controls 
the failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
variability of operating results  length of sales cycles 
the company s revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the number and timing of systems sales  the relatively large dollar amounts of customer contracts  the length of the sales cycles and delays in the implementation process 
the company has typically experienced sales cycles of four to nine months 
as a result  the company s results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations and its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
any inability of the company to reduce spending or to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or earn anticipated revenues could magnify the adverse impact of such events on the company s operating results 
further  the commencement of one or more major implementations could generate a large increase in revenues and net income for any given quarter or fiscal year  which increase may prove anomalous when compared to changes in revenues and net income in other periods 
the company s ability to complete implementation of its systems and recognize revenues is dependent on certain factors outside the control of the company  including its customers ability to allocate internal resources to the implementation process and  with respect to certain customers  the need to obtain necessary governmental approvals 
in addition  substantially all of the company s license agreements may be terminated under certain circumstances upon to days notice 
the company has experienced termination of license agreements in the past 
the termination of license agreements could result in the refund of license fees and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
dependence upon single product line 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from licensing its diamond tm software products  particularly its diamond tm c s product  fees for enhancing the diamond tm products and providing the associated implementation  support and consulting services to its customers 
the company intends to broaden its product line through the development and introduction of new products and through product acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to broaden its product line successfully  and any factor adversely affecting the market for any of the company s current products  particularly its diamond tm c s product  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on managed care industry 
substantially all of the company s revenues in fiscal  and were derived from the sale of software products and services to payors and providers that offer managed care products and services 
the company s success is dependent on continued demand for software and related services in that industry 
the company s growth is therefore dependent on the growth of that industry 
consolidation in the managed care industry could have a material adverse effect on the company  due to the decrease in the number of potential purchasers of the company s products and services or the acquisition of one or more of the company s customers by an acquirer that uses a different managed care information system 
the company believes that the commercial value and appeal of its products may be adversely affected if the current health care financing and reimbursement system were to be materially changed 
legislative or market driven reforms could have unpredictable effects on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and enhancement 
the market for the company s products is characterized by frequent new product introductions and enhancements  rapid technological advances and rapid changes in customer requirements and preferences 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products on a timely basis that respond to evolving customer requirements  achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing on a timely basis and marketing such products or enhancements  that its software will not contain errors that would delay product introduction  shipment or implementation  or that any such new products or enhancements will be accepted by the market 
because the company s products are important to the successful operation of its customers managed care organizations  errors or delays in product development and enhancement may have a material adverse effect on the continued market acceptance of the company s products and may expose the company to claims from customers and third parties 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company s future performance will depend on its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled managerial  sales and marketing  and technical personnel  including project managers  software programmers and systems architects skilled in the environments in which the company s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future 
the inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
relationship with shared medical systems 
in january  the company entered into an agreement under which sms markets  implements and supports the company s diamond tm products to the sms customer base the sms agreement 
during fiscal and  less than and approximately  respectively  of the company s total revenues were generated by sms 
there can be no assurance that sms will continue to sell the diamond tm products successfully  or that sms will be able to provide the level of service and support required to maintain its customer base 
the initial term of the sms agreement will continue through january with automatic renewals for successive two year periods unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than one year prior to the end of the then current term 
sms has the right to terminate the sms agreement prior to its expiration in the event of a material breach of the sms agreement by the company or under certain other circumstances 
the initial period expires in january and neither party has provided notice of termination 
in december  the company entered into an amendment to the sms agreement for the purpose of resolving certain disagreements between the parties and jointly pursuing opportunities in the european payor organization markets  amongst other matters 
the amendment provides for a million credit pool against which sms may charge billings for services rendered by the company  as well as future royalties payable by sms to license the diamond tm products in europe 
as of september   the credit pool had been reduced to approximately million 
due to the establishment of the credit pool  the company has not generated significant revenues from sms and is not expected to in the near future 
in addition  the company has agreed to provide certain services and enhancements to the diamond tm products for sms s payor markets 
subsequent to september   some of these enhancements were delivered as specified under the amendment 
the remainder of these enhancements are expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal in return  sms will undertake significant investments in the european payor organization markets and has agreed not to initiate litigation for certain matters  provided the company satisfies specified obligations 
as a result of this amendment  the company accrued approximately  as of september  to cover anticipated costs related to performance disagreements under the original sms agreement 
the termination of the sms agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the market for managed care information systems is highly competitive 
the company s competitors vary in the size  scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or offer products with superior functionality  including client server technology  or that other features of competitive products will not be preferred by the company s customers 
several of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources than the company 
in the future  additional competitors could enter the market  including providers of information systems to other segments of the health care industry  and compete with the company 
most of the company s sales are derived from competitive procurement processes managed directly by sophisticated customers or consultants that require specific  highly detailed presentations from several qualified vendors 
there can be no assurance that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights 
the company s success is dependent to a significant extent on its ability to maintain the confidentiality of proprietary and confidential software incorporated in its products and distributed under license agreements 
the company currently relies on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws  software security measures  license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
however  there can be no complete assurance that the legal protections and the precautions taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the company s technology 
in addition  these protections and precautions do not prevent independent third party development of competitive technology or products 
the company s practice of providing its customers with the source code to the company s software may increase the risk of unauthorized use of such software 
any infringement or misappropriation of the company s proprietary software could adversely affect the company s ability to retain and attract new customers in a highly competitive market and could cause the company to lose revenues or incur substantial litigation expense to enforce the company s proprietary rights 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringes the proprietary rights of third parties 
nonetheless  there can be no complete assurance that the company will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products and that such claims or proceedings if successful and significant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require the company to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
to the extent the company wishes or is required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
recent losses  accumulated deficit 
the company incurred net losses of   and  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
as of september   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company has yet to achieve significant levels of profitability and there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
contract liability 
while the company s software primarily provides operational functions  it also provides applications that relate to patient medical information 
any failure by the company s software to provide accurate information which would result in material damage to a customer  could result in liability claims against the company 
a successful liability claim brought against the company could result in expensive litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible volatility of stock price 
prior to march   there was no public market for the common stock  and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline below its current price 
the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has affected the market price of securities of many companies and which has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the trading price of the common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly results of operations  announcements of new products or acquisitions by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  other developments or disputes with respect to proprietary rights  general trends in the industry and overall market conditions  and other factors 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as announcements of new products by the company s competitors  as well as variations in the market conditions in the medical cost containment or software industries in general 
the market price may also be affected by movements in prices of equity securities in general
