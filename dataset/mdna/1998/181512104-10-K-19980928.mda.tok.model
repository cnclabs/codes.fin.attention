item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to explain the major factors and variances between periods of the company s results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes which begin on page introduction a majority of the company s revenue is derived from the production and licensing of television programming 
the company s television programming is licensed to the major television networks  cable networks  program distributors  domestic and foreign syndicators and advertisers 
the company also receives production fees from program buyers who retain ownership of the programming 
in addition  the company derives revenue from the rerun broadcast of its programs on network and cable television and in foreign markets as well as the licensing of its media and film archives to third parties for use in theatrical films and television movies  specials and commercials 
the company  on a limited basis  also develops theatrical films in association with established studios that generally provide the financing necessary for production 
the company also derives substantial revenue from its restaurant business dick clark restaurants  inc 
and its subsidiaries 
this business segment contributed approximately  and to the company s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
license fees for the production of television programming are generally paid to the company pursuant to license agreements during production and upon availability and delivery of the completed program or shortly thereafter 
revenue from network and cable television license agreements is recognized for financial statement purposes upon availability and delivery of each program or episode in the case of a series 
revenue from rerun broadcast both domestic and foreign is recognized for each program when it becomes contractually available for broadcast 
production costs of television programs are capitalized and charged to operations on an individual program basis in the ratio that the current year s gross revenue bears to management s estimate of the total revenue for each program from all sources 
substantially all television production costs are amortized in the initial year of delivery  except for those successful television series and television movies where there is likely to be future revenue earned in domestic and foreign syndication and other markets 
successful television series and television movies can achieve substantial revenue from rerun broadcasts in both foreign and domestic markets after their initial broadcast  thereby allowing a portion of the production costs to be amortized against future revenue 
distribution costs of television programs are expensed in the period incurred 
depending upon the type of contract  revenue for dick clark corporate productions  inc 
is recognized when the services are completed for a live event  when a tape or film is delivered to a customer  when services are completed pursuant to a particular phase of a contract which provides for periodic payments  or as may be otherwise provided in a particular contract 
costs of individual corporate event productions are capitalized and expensed as revenue is recognized 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources are more than adequate to meet its current working capital requirements 
the company had cash and marketable securities of approximately  as of june  compared to  as of june  the company has no outstanding bank borrowings or other indebtedness for borrowed money 
marketable securities consist primarily of investments in united states treasury bills and treasury notes 
the company classifies investments in marketable securities as held to maturity  and carries its investments at cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires investments in debt and equity securities  other than debt securities classified as held to maturity  to be reported at fair value 
historically  the company has funded its investment in television program costs primarily through installment payments of license fees and minimum guaranteed license payments from program buyers 
to the extent the company produces television movies and television series  the company may be required to finance the portion of its program costs for these programs not covered by guaranteed license payments from program buyers known in the television industry as deficit financing 
the company incurred deficit financing in connection with the production of a children s series delivered in fiscal none of the company s television production in fiscal required material deficit financing by the company 
no programs which are currently in development are anticipated to require material deficit financing 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in cash provided by operations and cash used for investing activities for those years primarily reflect changes in production activity and the construction of one dick clark s american bandstand grill restaurant in fiscal  three restaurants in fiscal and one restaurant in fiscal the company expects that the opening of additional american bandstand grill restaurants will be financed from available capital and or alternative financing methods such as joint ventures and limited recourse borrowings 
capital requirements for the company s corporate events and communications business  dick clark communications  inc  are anticipated to be immaterial to the company s overall capital position in fiscal the company expects that its available capital base and cash generated from operations will be more than sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
results of operations revenue revenue for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased revenues from television series and specials programming as well as revenues from additional restaurants which were not operating for a comparable period of time in fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased revenue associated with the television series tempestt which completed production during fiscal as well as decreased revenue associated with the company s communications business 
this decrease was offset in part by increased revenue associated with the opening of three additional restaurants during fiscal as well as the inclusion of revenue from an additional restaurant which was operating for only four months during fiscal during fiscal  revenue from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue and revenue from two different television series each represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from a five day per week talk show series represented approximately of total revenue and revenue recognized from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue 
no other production or project accounted for more than of total revenue for fiscal  or gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of decreased profitability recognized from television specials programming and restaurant operations 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to increased profitability of the company s television series production activities 
during fiscal  the company produced a five day per week television talk show series which earned a small gross profit as a percentage of sales 
this syndicated five day per week talk show series was canceled by the end of fiscal and  as a consequence  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is further explained by the production and delivery of a new dramatic series for fox broadcasting company during fiscal general administrative general and administrative expense increased in fiscal and fiscal compared to the corresponding periods in the previous fiscal years primarily as a result of increased personnel costs associated with the expansion of the restaurant business 
other minority interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as no major sales of the company s previously produced super bloopers and new practical jokes were made in fiscal the c c joint venture  of which the company has a interest  produced the super bloopers and new practical jokes television specials 
minority interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the licensing of the rebroadcast rights to episodes of super bloopers and new practical jokes 
the bloopers specials currently being produced by the company do not include the practical joke segments and are owned by the company and there is  therefore  no minority interest expense associated with their production 
other operating data ebitda is earnings before interest and other income  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
ebitda is presented supplementally because management believes it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or liquidity as promulgated under generally accepted accounting principles such as net income or cash provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities nor should it be considered as an indicator of the overall financial performance of the company 
the company s calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 
year the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because computer systems and applications were historically designed to use two digit fields to designate a year  and date sensitive systems may not recognize at all  or if recognized  as information technology systems account for most of the year work and include all computer systems and technology managed by the company 
all core systems have been assessed and work is being undertaken to test and implement changes where required 
information technology vendors and suppliers have been contacted as to their year compliance and their responses have been factored into the company s plans 
normal software version upgrades and hardware replacements have solved a majority of the company s year issues 
based on the nature of the company s business  it is not expected that any non financial software applications and hardware that may be impacted by the year issue would cause any interruption in operations 
the company is communicating with its significant customers and vendors to understand their year issues and how they might prepare themselves to manage those issues as they relate to the company 
to date  no significant customers or vendors have informed the company that a material year issue exists which will have a material effect on the company 
the company expects to complete any changes required to overcome the year issue during fiscal  and  the total cost to remediate will not be material to the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company does not currently have a year contingency plan but intends to create one during fiscal disclosure regarding private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the future performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties 
various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the company s ability to develop and sell television programming  timely completion of negotiations for new restaurant sites and the ability to construct  finance and open new restaurants and to attract new corporate productions clients  and such competitive and other business risks as from time to time may be detailed in the company s securities and exchange commission reports
