the product is being developed jointly by alliance and schering

the company had net working capital of million at june   compared to million at june  the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased to million at june  from million at june  the decrease resulted primarily from cash used in operations of million and property  plant  and equipment additions of million  partially offset by proceeds from a loan and security agreement of million and by net proceeds from the sale to sbvc of convertible series d preferred stock in the amount of million in conjunction with the schering license agreement 
the company s operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash  and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
the company continually reviews its product development activities in an effort to allocate its resources to those product candidates that the company believes have the greatest commercial potential 
factors considered by the company in determining the products to pursue include projected markets and need  potential for regulatory approval and reimbursement under the existing healthcare system  status of its proprietary rights  technical feasibility  expected and known product attributes  and estimated costs to bring the product to market 
based on these and other factors  the company may from time to time reallocate its resources among its product development activities 
additions to products under development or changes in products being pursued can substantially and rapidly change the company s funding requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial additional expenditures associated with product development  particularly for liquivent and oxygent as they move into pivotal clinical trials 
the company will seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners for its non licensed products 
there can be no assurance that such relationships  if any  will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of its product development programs  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
alliance anticipates that its current capital resources  including proceeds from the sale of the e stock in august  expected revenue from the schering license agreement and investments  and future proceeds from the sale of additional preferred stock under the august stock purchase agreement  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements for at least the next months 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  continued scientific progress in its research and development programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  patent costs  competing technological and market developments  changes in existing collaborative relationships  the ability of the company to establish additional collaborative relationships  and the cost of manufacturing scale up 
while the company believes that it can produce materials for clinical trials and the initial market launch for oxygent and imagent at its existing san diego facilities and for liquivent at its otisville  new york facility  it may need to expand its commercial manufacturing capabilities for its products in the future 
any expansion for any of its products may occur in stages  each of which would require regulatory approval  and product demand could at times exceed supply capacity 
the company has not selected a site for such expanded facilities and cannot predict the amount it will expend for the construction of such facilities 
there can be no assurance as to when or whether the fda will determine that such facilities comply with good manufacturing practices 
the projected location and construction of such facilities will depend on regulatory approvals  product development  and capital resources  among other factors 
the company has not obtained any regulatory approvals for its production facilities for these products  nor can there be any assurance that it will be able to do so 
the schering license agreement requires the company to manufacture products at its san diego facility for a period of time after market launch at a negotiated price 
schering will be responsible for establishing production capacity beyond the maximum capacity of the san diego facility 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish the st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
management has initiated its year program  which has already identified several systems that are not yet year compliant 
the company expects to complete its initial assessment by the end of the year 
the assessment will include third party confirmations with respect to their computers  software and systems  and a listing of all equipment subject to year concerns 
the company has already initiated the removal and exchange of some non compliant systems and expects to continue such replacement or other remedial programs to assure that its computers  software  and other systems will continue to operate in the year while the company has begun evaluating potential strategies for resolving its year problems  the dollar amount the company will spend to remediate such issues remains uncertain 
the company believes such costs will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s computer systems and applications of other companies on which the company s operations rely  will be timely converted  or that any such failure to convert by another company will not have a material adverse effect on the company systems 
moreover  a failure of i company scientific  manufacturing and other equipment to operate at all or operate accurately  ii clinical trial site medical equipment to perform properly  iii necessary materials or supplies to be available to the company when needed  or iv other equipment  software  or systems as a result of year problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
except for historical information  the statements made herein and elsewhere are forward looking 
the company wishes to caution readers that these statements are only predictions and that the company s business is subject to significant risks 
the factors discussed herein and other important factors  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results for  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
these risks include the inability to enter into collaborative relationships to further develop and commercialize the company s products  changes in any such relationships  or the inability of any collaborative partner to adequately commercialize any of the company s products  the uncertainties associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process  obtaining and enforcing patents important to the company s business  possible competition from other products  and year issues 
furthermore  even if the company s products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of important reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals  difficulties in manufacturing on a large scale  failure to obtain market acceptance  and the inability to commercialize because of proprietary rights of third parties 
the research  development  and market introduction of new products will require the application of considerable technical and financial resources  while revenues generated from such products  assuming they are developed successfully  may not be realized for several years 
other material and unpredictable factors which could affect operating results include  without limitation  the uncertainty of the timing of product approvals and introductions and of sales growth  the ability to obtain necessary raw materials at cost effective prices or at all  the effect of possible technology and or other business acquisitions or transactions  and the increasing emphasis on controlling healthcare costs and potential legislation or regulation of healthcare pricing
