accordingly  through october   no provisions were made for income taxes since all income  deductions  gains  losses and credits were reported on the tax returns of the owners 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been cash flows from operations  borrowings under the company s bank credit facility and issuances of its common stock 
these sources of cash flows have been offset by cash used for investment in skill crane machines and payment of long term borrowings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that cash will continue to be provided by operations as additional skill crane machines are placed in service 
cash required in the future is expected to be funded by existing cash and cash provided by operations  borrowings under the company s credit facility or sale of equity securities 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  of which million  million and million were represented by the acquisition of skill crane machines

the company may use a portion of its capital resources to effect acquisitions 
because the company cannot predict the timing or nature of acquisition opportunities  or the availability of acquisition financing  the company cannot determine the extent to which capital resources may be used 
company management believes the company s financial condition is strong and that funds generated from operations and borrowings available under its credit agreement and the company s ability to negotiate additional and enhanced credit agreements will be sufficient to meet the company s foreseeable operating and capital expenditure needs

risk factors this report contains forward looking statements 
because such statements include risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in the sections entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and the company s prospectus dated october  growth and management of growth 
the company has recently experienced substantial growth  however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow at historical rates or at all 
the company s ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability will depend upon its ability and the ability of its franchisees to place additional shoppes as well as to maintain or increase the average financial performance of the shoppes 
the company s ability to place additional shoppes depends on a number of factors beyond the company s control  including general business and economic conditions 
installation of additional shoppes will also depend  in part  upon the company s ability to secure additional national and regional supermarket  mass merchandiser and restaurant chain accounts and to obtain approval to place additional shoppes in individual locations of such accounts 
the company  its franchisees and their suppliers also may be unable to place and adequately service additional shoppes 
acquisition related risks 
the company may use a portion of its capital resources to effect acquisitions 
because the company cannot predict the timing or nature of acquisition opportunities  or the availability of acquisition financing  the company cannot determine the extent to which capital resources may be used 
the company is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidates will become available or the likelihood of a material transaction being completed should any negotiations commence 
if the company proceeds with any such transaction  no assurance can be given that the company can effectively integrate the acquired operations with its own 
the company also may seek to finance any such acquisition through debt financings or issuances of equity and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
trade relations and dependence on major accounts 
the company s largest major account  wal mart  accounted for approximately and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
in august  the company entered into a contract with wal mart that expires on january  although the company has entered into a contract with wal mart  national and regional retail accounts generally do not enter into long term contracts with vendors 
in individual location accounts  the company and its franchisees generally place shoppes pursuant to oral agreements with location managers 
the arrangements of the company and its franchisees with most of these accounts may be terminated at any time 
in addition  wal mart may terminate its contract with the company under certain limited circumstances 
the loss of the wal mart account  or the loss of a significant number of other major accounts  or a significant reduction in the number of shoppes placed at such accounts  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers and foreign sourcing 
substantially all the company s plush toys and other products dispensed from the shoppes are produced by foreign manufacturers 
a majority are purchased directly by the company from manufacturers in the people s republic of china china 
the company purchases its other products indirectly from vendors who obtain a significant percentage of such products from foreign manufacturers 
as a result  the company is subject to changes in governmental policies  the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions and labor strikes which could disrupt the supply of products from such manufacturers 
among other things  the loss of china s most favored nation status under us tariff laws could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of certain products manufactured in china  which could result in substantially increased costs for certain products purchased by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial performance 
nature of franchise relations 
for the year ended december   the company derived approximately of its total revenue from franchise and other revenue 
the company expects to continue to derive revenue from its franchisees in the future 
franchise and other revenue consists primarily of product sales to franchisees and royalties from franchisees 
the company s franchise agreements generally grant franchisees an exclusive geographic territory in which the company generally may not place or operate the same type of shoppes 
although the franchise agreements require franchisees to place a specified minimum number of shoppes within their territories and to pay franchise royalties  franchisees are under no minimum product purchase or minimum annual royalty payment obligations 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that the company will continue to realize the same or greater revenue from its franchisees 
the company also cannot require franchisees to expand operations within their territories or preclude them from taking actions inconsistent with the company s expansion plans or business strategy 
seasonality and variability of results 
the financial performance of the shoppes is substantially dependent on the level of retail traffic at such shoppes particular location 
accordingly  the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company can be materially and adversely affected by factors that reduce retail traffic at shoppe locations 
these include numerous factors beyond the company s control such as weather  labor strikes and other disruptions of the business at retail accounts and local and national business and economic conditions 
the company s results are also linked to seasonal increases in foot traffic at retail accounts  and disruptions of past trends  including traditional increases during holiday seasons could decrease the company s revenue 
as a result  the company s operating results may vary significantly over time 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and the company s past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
dependence on key employees 
the company s success to date has been dependent in part upon the efforts and abilities of jerome m 
lapin its president  chief executive officer and chairman  w 
john cash its vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  randall j 
fagundo its vice president of operations and secretary  abbe m 
stutsman its vice president of purchasing and product development  and certain other key personnel 
the company s continued success will depend upon its ability to retain a number of its current key employees and to attract  train and retain new key management and operational personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing key employees or attract and retain qualified employees in the future 
the company does not maintain any key man insurance 
in addition  executives or other employees with knowledge of the company s operations and policies may leave the company and establish competitive businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to effectively enforce non compete provisions against these individuals
