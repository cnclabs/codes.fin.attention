inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
market risk disclosure not applicable 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made above are the following the company s future growth will depend to a considerable extent on the expansion of sales of its marine antenna aiming products 
to date  the market for mobile satellite communications products has been limited 
the company s first satellite communications product  an antenna aiming system for use with satellites operated by the international maritime satellite organization inmarsat  was introduced in late the company s tracvision system for mobile reception of direct broadcast satellite television services dbs tv was introduced in late  and the tracphone mobile satellite telephone system for use with the skycell voice  fax and data services offered by amsc was introduced in the second quarter of the tracvision ii a smaller and less expensive version of the tracvision  was introduced in september of and the tracphone  a smaller  less expensive version of the asap line of products  was introduced in september of as a turnkey system offering airtime services provided by station with kvh hardware 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if any of the inmarsat  station or dbs tv satellite networks experience operating  financial or regulatory problems  if no significant maritime market develops for these services  or if the company s products do not achieve significant market acceptance in these emerging markets 
also  if the company builds inventory in anticipation of potential sales in the marine satellite communications market  the failure of that market to develop could result in inventory obsolescence 
the company relies upon sales of new products under large contracts to a small number of customers  and the sales cycles for some of the company s products are long and difficult to predict  resulting in variability of a significant portion of its product revenues 
the introduction of new products involves the identification and qualification of new material and component vendors 
new products may contain undetected component  hardware  software or mechanical defects or failures when first introduced or may develop defects or failures after commencement of commercial production or shipments 
any such delays  defects or failures could cause loss of goodwill with distributors and with current or potential customers  impair or prevent the market acceptance of the company s products and result in lost revenue due to cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments or to product recalls  returns or discounts 
the company could also incur unexpected and significant costs  including product redesign costs and costs associated with customer support 
the company s products are generally sold with a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for a period of one year but in certain cases for as long as three to five years 
if any of the company s products were found within the warranty period to contain such defects  the company could be required to repair  replace or refund the purchase price of the defective products 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the armed forces of the united states and of foreign governments and from contractors that manufacture military land vehicles for such governments 
there can be no assurance that such governments or their contractors will continue to purchase the company s products in similar amounts 
changes in procurement priorities or significant reductions or delays in procurement of the company s products by the united states or any foreign government would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
generally  the united states government and its contractors and subcontractors may terminate their contracts with the company for cause or for convenience  upon certain terms and conditions 
in many instances  the united states government or its contractors purchase the company s products on a purchase order basis  without firm commitments 
moreover  even under firm orders by the united states government or its contractors  funding must nevertheless be appropriated in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract 
the company experienced a significant growth in military contracts in and anticipates that these contracts will not reoccur in as a result  the company anticipates that product gross profits will decline in from levels 
satellite communications technologies are changing rapidly as new satellite systems are placed into service 
the iridium low earth orbit leo system is close to completion  offering handheld products that will compete with larger  more costly actively stabilized antenna systems 
although leo service costs are anticipated to be more costly than inmarsat services  there is no assurance that this technology or other technologies will not reduce the inmarsat market share
