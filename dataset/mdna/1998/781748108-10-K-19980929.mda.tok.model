item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
introduction the company derives its revenue primarily from fees charged for ambulance and fire protection services 
the company provides ambulance services in response to emergency medical calls emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services general transport services to patients on both a fee for service basis and nonrefundable subscription fee basis 
per transport revenue depends on various factors  including the mix of rates between existing markets and new markets and the mix of activity between emergency ambulance services and general transport services as well as other competitive factors 
fire protection services are provided either under contracts with municipalities or fire districts or on a nonrefundable subscription fee basis to individual homeowners or commercial property owners 
domestic ambulance service fees are recorded net of medicare  medicaid  and other reimbursement limitations and are recognized when services are provided 
payments received from third party payors represent a substantial portion of the company s ambulance service fee receipts 
the company derived approximately and of its net ambulance fee collections from such third party payors during and  respectively 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on credit risk applicable to certain types of payors  historical trends and other relevant information 
provision for doubtful accounts is made for the expected difference between ambulance services fees charged and amounts actually collected 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts generally is higher with respect to collections to be derived directly from patients than for collections to be derived from third party payors and generally is higher for emergency ambulance services than for general ambulance transport services 
because of the nature of the company s ambulance services  it is necessary to respond to a number of calls  primarily emergency ambulance service calls  which may not result in transports 
results of operations are discussed below on the basis of actual transports since transports are more directly related to revenue 
expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports are included in operating expenses 
the percentage of calls not resulting in transports varies substantially depending upon the mix of general transport and emergency ambulance service calls in the company s markets and is generally higher in markets in which the calls are primarily emergency ambulance service calls 
rates in the company s markets take into account the anticipated number of calls that may not result in transports 
the company does not separately account for expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports 
revenue generated under the company s capitated service arrangements in argentina and contractual agreements in canada is included in ambulance services revenue 
revenue generated under fire protection services contracts is recognized over the life of the contract 
subscription fees received in advance are deferred and recognized over the term of the subscription agreement  which generally is one year 
other revenue primarily consists of fees associated with alternative transportation  dispatch  fleet  billing and home health care services and is recognized when the services are provided 
other operating expenses primarily consist of rent and related occupancy expenses  maintenance and repairs  insurance  fuel and supplies  travel and professional fees 
the company s net income for the year ended june  was million or 
per share diluted 
this compares to net income of million and million  or and per share diluted  for the years ended june  and  respectively

results of operations the following table sets forth for the years ended june   and  certain items from the company s consolidated financial statements expressed as a percentage of total revenue years ended june  revenue ambulance services fire protection services other total revenue operating expenses payroll and employee benefits provision for doubtful accounts depreciation amortization of intangibles other operating expenses loss contract restructuring charge operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue total revenue increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  approximately million of this increase resulted from the acquisition of ambulance service providers during fiscal fire protection services revenue increased by million  and other revenue increased by million 
total ambulance transports increased by approximately  or  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the acquisition of eleven ambulance service companies during fiscal accounted for these additional transports 
fire protection services revenue increased due to rate increases for fire protection services and greater utilization of the company s services under fee for service arrangements 
the increase also resulted from revenue generated from new fire protection contracts awarded to the company through competitive bidding 
other revenue increased primarily from the fees received for billing  dispatch  and other services pursuant to the company s agreement with san diego fire and life safety services 
operating expenses payroll and employee benefit expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of eleven ambulance service companies during fiscal payroll and employee benefit expenses increased from of total revenue during the year ended june  to of total revenue during the year ended june  primarily due to the low unemployment in certain market areas  which made the recruitment  training  and retention of full and part time personnel more difficult and costly 
provision for doubtful accounts increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts increased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to of total revenue for the year ended june  and increased from of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june  to of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june  the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts resulted from increased revenue from both acquisitions and internal growth and  for the reasons described below  an additional provision for doubtful accounts of million recorded in the fourth quarter 
as identified in the company s third quarter form q  the company began experiencing delays in payments from certain third party payors and a general industry trend toward a lengthening payment cycle 
during the third and fourth quarters  the company and its management assessed the impact this more difficult medical reimbursement environment was having on the timing and collectability of the company s accounts receivable 
at the conclusion of management s assessment process and considering the results of recent collection efforts as well as other factors  in the fourth quarter management determined that these adverse changes had increased the level of effort and reasonable cost associated with obtaining reimbursement and collection of certain accounts receivable to such an extent that an additional provision for doubtful accounts of million was recorded 
in addition  management believes that future write offs of accounts receivable will exceed historical levels  thus necessitating a higher provision for doubtful accounts and greater levels of expenditures to collect the accounts receivable 
this more difficult reimbursement environment has further complicated the process of integrating new billing offices into the company s regional billing centers and has affected the company s billing and collection procedures 
net accounts receivable on non integrated collection systems currently represent of total net accounts receivable at june  the company anticipates the remaining three non integrated billing centers will be integrated during depreciation increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june   primarily due to increased property and equipment from recent acquisition activity

amortization of intangibles increased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  other operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june   primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with the operation of the eleven ambulance service companies acquired during fiscal other operating expenses decreased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to of total revenue for the year ended june  as a result of operational efficiencies realized through the integration of these acquired companies 
during the year ended june   the company recorded a non recurring pre tax charge of million primarily for severance payments 
this charge relates to the company s reduction of certain administrative personnel at corporate headquarters and regional offices 
management expects these severance payments will be substantially completed during fiscal interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was caused by higher debt balances and higher interest rates than historically incurred  primarily because of the issuance of million of senior notes due during fiscal the company s effective tax rate increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   primarily the result of the effect of nondeductible goodwill amortization applied against earnings that had been reduced by the additional provision for doubtful accounts and accrual for severance payments 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue total revenue increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  approximately million of this increase resulted from the acquisition of ambulance service providers during fiscal fire protection services revenue increased by million  and other revenue increased by million 
total ambulance transports increased by  or  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the acquisition of eighteen ambulance service companies during fiscal accounted for  of these additional transports 
fire protection services revenue increased due to rate increases for fire protection services and greater utilization of the company s services under fee for service arrangements 
the increase also resulted from the revenue generated from new fire protection contracts awarded to the company through competitive bidding

the charge consists primarily of severance costs and other costs related to the elimination of redundant functions

the company has historically experienced  and expects to continue to experience  moderate seasonality in quarterly operating results 
this seasonality has resulted from a number of factors  including relatively higher second and third fiscal quarter demand for transport services in the company s arizona and florida regions resulting from the greater winter populations in those regions 
in the future  the operating results of the company s argentine operations may impact the seasonality of the company s quarterly operating results

the company also depends upon the ability of telephone systems to be year compliant in order for the company to receive incoming calls for service to its ambulance and fire dispatch systems 
the failure of telephone service providers to adequately provide service could impact the company s ability to dispatch ambulance and fire protection services in a timely manner 
the failure of third party payors  such as private insurers  managed care providers  health care organizations  preferred provider organizations  and federal and state government agencies that administer medicare and or medicaid  to adequately address their year issues could impact their ability to reimburse the company for services provided or otherwise adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations
