the term in pre development planning means developments in planning and owned land has been acquired or is under a long term ground lease and developments in planning and under control land which is under control through contingent contract or letter of intent with construction anticipated to commence within months 
for analysis purposes homestead categorizes its operating properties which include all properties not under construction or in pre development planning as comparable  noncomparable  or new opening 
comparable means a property open throughout both periods of comparison  noncomparable means a property open for only a portion of the prior period of comparison  and new opening means a property opened in the most recent period 
for additional analysis purposes homestead also categorizes its operating properties as either stabilized or pre stabilized 
for purposes of this report  the term stabilized means those properties which have been open for six months or achieved occupancy as of the beginning of a period and pre stabilized means all other operating properties 
overview general since the first homestead village property was opened in and through december   homestead has completed homestead village properties consisting of  rooms in cities 
as of december   homestead had properties under construction totaling  rooms within of these cities as well as additional cities 
in addition  homestead owns development sites and controls through contracts development sites for which it plans to initiate construction within the next months  for a total of properties aggregating  rooms in cities 
homestead s property investments from the date of the mergers through december  have been funded primarily by million from borrowings under convertible mortgage notes payable from affiliates ptr and atlantic  million in exercises of warrants of which security capital funded million and million borrowed under its bank lines of credit 
pre merger financing of property investments were primarily funded by borrowings from an affiliate 
in january  homestead completed a rights offering which provided net proceeds of approximately million that were used to repay all borrowings under the bank lines of credit and for land acquisition and development costs 
homestead s operating results are substantially influenced by i the demand for and supply of extended stay lodging in homestead s markets and submarkets  ii occupancy and average weekly rate  iii the effectiveness of property level operations and iv the pace and cost at which homestead can develop additional extended stay lodging properties 
capital and credit market conditions which affect homestead s cost of capital may influence future operating results 
background mergers prior to october  the operating assets of homestead were held primarily by subsidiaries of ptr 
one operating property  opened in mid  was held by a subsidiary of atlantic 
onsite property management was performed by a subsidiary of security capital  which charged a fee based on a percentage to of gross operating property revenues 
other services such as investment research  land acquisition  due diligence  development  marketing  asset management  legal and accounting functions  were performed under ptr s and atlantic s overall reit management agreements management agreements with subsidiaries of security capital 
the fee charged for all services provided under the management agreements was based on of cash flow from operations as defined in the management agreements 
neither ptr nor atlantic had any employees 
all persons performing services related to homestead village properties prior to the mergers were employees of the property management and reit management subsidiaries of security capital 
upon the closing of the mergers  all of the ptr and atlantic homestead village properties  including those under construction and in pre development planning  became assets of homestead 
additionally  with the acquisition of certain security capital subsidiaries  all onsite property management and overall corporate management became an internal function of homestead whereby homestead now directly incurs the costs of all property level  land acquisition  due diligence  development and corporate personnel 
in addition to the change from fee based property and corporate management to internal management  the operating results of homestead reported in the accompanying financial statements are affected by certain matters of financial presentation for the mergers 
the merger with the subsidiaries of ptr has been accounted for as a combination of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests  thus the historical financial results of the ptr subsidiaries are presented for all periods prior to october  and  as the activities of homestead prior to the mergers were not significant  the accompanying financial statements consist predominantly of the activities of the ptr subsidiaries prior to the merger closing date 
the merger of the subsidiaries of atlantic was accounted for as a purchase  thus the operating revenues and operating expenses of its one property opened in mid are not included in the accompanying financial statements until the date of the mergers 
additionally  the development activities of the subsidiaries of atlantic are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements until the merger closing date and thereafter 
the merger of the subsidiaries of security capital was also accounted for as a purchase  thus the incurrence of the costs of personnel for property and corporate management are effective in the accompanying financial statements after the merger closing date 
development activity homestead s property development program has had a significant impact on its financial performance during  and the following table summarizes homestead s development activity for  and dollar amounts in thousands properties under construction starts during period properties rooms    completions during period properties rooms    under construction at year end properties rooms    total expected investment    completed properties properties rooms    total investment  at historical cost    the table summarizes the investment activity for all homestead village properties regardless of the form of ownership of such properties prior to the mergers 
total expected investment represents budgeted development cost for properties under construction 
budgeted development cost includes the cost of land  fees  permits  payments to contractors  architectural and engineering fees and interest  property taxes  and development overhead costs to be capitalized during the development period 
land held for future development or for sale  which is less than of property assets based on historical cost as of december   is not included above 
results of operations for the years ended december   and net earnings for the years ended december    were million  million and million  respectively 
the growth in net earnings is related primarily to increases in the number of developed and opened operating properties 
a discussion of the major components of the increases in net earnings follows 
property operations the following table sets forth operating performance information for the years ended december   and the information is for homestead s total operating property portfolio 
performance of the one operating property acquired from atlantic has been included from its opening date of july  versus its date of acquisition in the mergers 
inclusion of such property has an insignificant effect on the performance data presented 
change change over over weekly revpar average weekly rate occupancy property operating income margin revpar is determined by dividing room revenue by the number of guest room days available for the period and multiplying by seven 
average weekly rate is determined by dividing room revenue by the number of guest room days occupied for the period and multiplying by seven 
homestead s new property openings were the primary reason for room revenue increases of million in over and million in over properties open for their first full year in and were the next most significant reason for room revenue increases 
the increase in room revenue was also due to increases in the average weekly rate of in and in the average weekly rate increase in was partially offset by lower overall occupancy in versus the occupancy decrease in versus is attributable to more openings in and the lower occupancy of such properties until stabilized  and to the effect of strategic pricing in certain markets as described below for same store properties 
total property operating expenses increased million in over and increased million in over  primarily due to the increase in the number of operating properties as noted above 
the smaller percentage growth in operating expenses in versus the percentage growth in room revenue reflects homestead s reduction of costs through operating and purchasing efficiencies 
these property operating expense improvements combined with the revpar increases  improved homestead s property operating income margin to in from in homestead properties fully operating throughout consecutive periods homestead had properties  representing  rooms  that were fully operational throughout both and same store properties 
all but one of such properties are located in texas 
revpar increased in to due to an average weekly rate growth of  offset somewhat by a decrease in occupancy to 
the decline in occupancy was the direct result of implementing strategic pricing in certain markets 
for the fourth quarter occupancy for same store properties is versus for fourth quarter homestead had properties all in texas  representing  rooms that were fully operational throughout both and revpar increased to in from in due to an increase in occupancy to versus in and an increase in average weekly rate to in from in stabilized properties operations homestead categorizes its properties as stabilized upon attaining occupancy for a one week period or upon the property s having been open for weeks 
the stabilized properties in showed improved operating performance over the stabilized properties in with a increase in revpar to from for and an increase in property operating income margin to from 
these improvements are attributable to a increase in the average weekly rate occupancy was essentially unchanged and the operating expense efficiencies noted above for homestead s total portfolio 
the stabilized properties showed a improvement in revpar versus the performance of the stabilized properties properties and an increase in property operating income margin to from in these improvements are attributable to a increase in the average weekly rate 
corporate operating expenses corporate operating expense increased million in over and in over these comparisons are affected by the fact that corporate expenses reflect a post merger operating basis while and operations consist only of the corporate costs and reit management fee allocations from ptr to the ptr subsidiaries through the october  merger date 
the increase in relates to the change in corporate structure from external management to internal management and additional corporate costs associated with the continued growth of the company 
this change in structure involves costs associated with operating as a public company  recruiting  relocation and personnel expenses and other costs to create a corporate infrastructure  offset in part by capitalizing costs related to information technology  and the acquisition  development or improvement of real estate 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in over and million in over depreciation of the cost of properties and improvements is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation expense increased approximately million in over and increased million in over due to new property openings each year 
amortization expense increased million in over and  in over due to amortization of the homestead village trademark and other intangibles acquired in the mergers 
interest income interest income of  recorded in and  in resulted from investment of excess cash on hand 
nearly all of the amount was earned after the mergers 
interest cost homestead records  as a component of total interest cost  the amortization of non cash financing costs arising from the issuance of the warrants to obtain the commitment for convertible mortgage notes financing and the differential between the conversion price under the mortgages and the merger date value of homestead s common stock 
exclusive of such amortized amounts homestead s interest cost comprised of interest on the mortgages  amortization of premiums and discounts on the mortgages  interest on its lines of credit borrowings  amortization of deferred financing costs paid to obtain the lines of credit and interest on the other debt to an affiliate increased million in over and million in over the increases are due to the increase in investments in operating and under construction properties and the corresponding increases in the convertible mortgage notes payable in and  the lines of credit increase in and other debt to an affiliate increases in and homestead s total interest cost  including the amortization of non cash mortgage financing costs described above  increased million in over and million in over the increase was predominantly due to amortization of the non cash financing costs associated with the mortgages 
total interest cost incurred was offset by an increase in capitalized interest of million in over and million in over homestead s increased development activity in was the reason for capitalization of nearly all interest cost incurred  resulting in a decrease in net interest expense to million in versus million net interest expense in net interest expense in represented an increase over net interest expense of million as  prior to the mergers  interest on debt incurred by homestead was not all capitalized due to its limited development program on a standalone basis and interest incurred by the ptr subsidiaries represented increased leverage on properties reaching operational status 
environmental matters homestead is not aware of  nor does it expect  any environmental condition on its properties to have a material adverse effect upon its business  results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  homestead had properties in construction  additional sites owned  and sites under contractual control with acquisition and construction start expected to occur within twelve months 
homestead intends to pursue additional sites for acquisition and development with an expectation of to construction starts annually through the year unfunded development commitments for properties under construction as of december  approximates million 
expected future investment to develop the properties owned as of december  is approximately million 
the estimated total investment to acquire and develop the properties under contractual control approximates million 
in january homestead completed a million rights offering under its currently effective million common stock shelf registration and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
rights offering proceeds of million were used to repay all borrowings under homestead s lines of credit and the remaining net proceeds were used for land acquisition and development costs 
other resources to fund homestead s development program consist of its million revolving line of credit facility described below  and  to a lesser extent  approximately million in unfunded mortgage commitments from ptr and atlantic  and cash from operations in excess of operating needs 
in addition  homestead may seek to issue the remaining approximate million of common stock under its shelf registration statement at such time  amount and price as set forth at the time of such offering 
on may  homestead entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility with commerzbank ag cag which provided for borrowings of up to million  subject to collateral requirements  with borrowings bearing interest at the eurodollar rate plus per annum  and an unfunded commitment fee of 
on august  the facility was amended to provide for borrowings of up to million  subject to collateral requirements  and to lower the interest rate to the eurodollar rate plus per annum 
additionally  the unfunded commitment fee was amended to if the average unfunded balance is greater than million or if the average unfunded balance is million or less 
the revolving line of credit matures may  and may be extended with the approval of the lenders 
presently homestead is seeking and expects renewal and expansion of the line 
at december  borrowings under the line totaled  at a weighted average stated interest rate of 
outstanding borrowings and all accrued interest were repaid in january upon the funding of the proceeds of the subscription rights offering 
the line requires maintenance of certain financial covenants  specifically  aggregate indebtedness of no more than of gross asset value  as defined  or indebtedness secured by a lien of no more than of gross asset value  as defined 
homestead must also maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and gains or losses on sales of assets to debt service  as defined  of no less than to and not allow stockholders equity to be less than million 
the covenants also restrict payment of dividends without lender approval 
homestead was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  on november   homestead obtained a million interim credit agreement with cag which provided for borrowings  at homestead s option  at either the eurodollar rate plus or at base rate the higher of of in excess of the federal funds rate or the prime rate plus 
borrowings and all accrued interest under this agreement were repaid in january upon the funding of the proceeds of the rights offering 
upon repayment of the interim borrowings no further commitment was available under this agreement 
at december  borrowings under the interim credit agreement totaled  at a weighted average stated interest rate of 
during the term of this interim credit agreement  borrowings under homestead s million secured revolving line of credit were limited to million 
capital resources in addition to those described above will be needed to fund homestead s planned developments 
homestead will require a substantial amount of additional capital over time to finance its future growth  the amount of which will depend on a number of factors including the number of properties homestead constructs  the pace of development activities and the cash flow generated by its properties 
it is anticipated that homestead s total expected investment as of december  in properties under construction will be approximately million and homestead s total expected investment for properties in planning and owned will be approximately million 
as a result  homestead will seek to raise substantial additional amounts of capital in and homestead may seek additional credit facilities and may issue long term debt and additional equity securities 
however  there is no assurance that homestead will be able to obtain such financing as and when required or on acceptable terms 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to and million for as compared to these increases are due primarily to the growing number of homestead operating properties as described under results of operations for the years ended december    as well as improvements in operations 
investing and financing activities during the years ended december    and  homestead invested million  million and million  respectively in homestead village properties 
the amounts invested in were financed primarily from million proceeds from convertible mortgage loans from ptr and atlantic  by million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants  and borrowings of million under the lines of credit 
property investments in were financed primarily from other borrowings from an affiliate by the subsidiaries of ptr prior to the mergers  the expenditure of million received in cash from atlantic at the merger closing date for development of properties acquired from atlantic  million in proceeds from the convertible mortgage loans from ptr  and million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants by security capital 
in prior to the mergers  homestead  on a standalone basis  borrowed million under a note payable to security capital to fund pursuit costs and land acquisitions 
the note was repaid at the date of the mergers 
the amounts invested in were financed primarily by other borrowings from an affiliate by the ptr subsidiaries from ptr and to a lesser extent from contributed capital from ptr 
impact of year homestead has undertaken a review of all of its computer systems and applications to determine if these programs are year compliant and if not  the efforts that will be necessary to bring the programs into compliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
homestead has not identified any computer system or application for which a failure to be year compliant would result in a material adverse impact on homestead s business activities or results of operations 
however  the preliminary results of this review indicate that certain of homestead s accounting and financial reporting applications are not year compliant 
in order to enhance operating efficiencies  homestead has already undertaken a project that will replace these core financial systems with computer software that will better serve homestead in the future 
this new software  that is expected to be fully operational by the end of  is year compliant 
homestead is currently evaluating year modifications to other existing software programs 
the cost of these modifications is not expected to be material and all conversions and modifications are expected to be completed in a timely manner 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of homestead properties  management believes that occupancy and revenues may be lower than normal during the months of december and january due to the holiday season 
because many of homestead s expenses do not fluctuate with occupancy  such declines in occupancy may cause fluctuations or decreases in homestead s earnings during these periods 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenue or operating results of homestead in there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not affect future operating or construction costs 
dividends the board intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings to finance homestead s growth and for general corporate purposes and  therefore  does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  homestead s line of credit arrangements restrict payment of dividends without lender approval
