all of the company s product candidates  other than hectorol trademark for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with esrd  are at an early stage of development and will require extensive research and development and preclinical and clinical testing prior to commercialization 
the company s ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on its ability to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates and successfully manufacture and market any approved products either by itself or in collaboration with third parties 
there can be no assurance as to when the company will achieve profitability  or that profitability  if achieved  will be sustained

the company could be adversely affected if it or third parties fail to successfully achieve year compliance
