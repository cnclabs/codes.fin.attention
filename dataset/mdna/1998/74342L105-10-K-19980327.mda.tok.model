the company was incorporated in texas in and was reincorporated in delaware in january promedco commenced operations in december and affiliated with its initial physician group in june the company s rapid growth in and has resulted primarily from its affiliation with additional physician groups 
as of december   the company was affiliated with aproximately providers in states consisting of approximately physicians and mid level providers in affiliated physician groups and approximately physicians in associated ipa networks 
the company also contracts with hmos and other third party payors to arrange for the provision of comprehensive health services to their members on a capitation basis 
currently the company provide ssuch services covering approximately  capitated lives through its affiliated groups as well as through associated ipa networks 
when affiliating with a physician group  the company typically acquires at fair market value the group s non real estate operating assets and enters into a year service agreement with the group in exchange for a combination of common stock  cash  other securities of the company  and or the assumption of certain liabilities 
the company is continually seeking additional physician groups with which to affiliate and at any time is typically engaged in negotiations with several such groups 
physician groups revenue represents the revenue of the physician groups  reported at the estimated realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  net of contractual and other adjustments 
management fee revenue represents physician groups revenue less amounts retained by physician groups 
the amounts retained by physician groups typically of the physician group operating income represent amounts paid to the physicians pursuant to the service agreements between the company and the physician groups 
under the service agreements  the company provides each physician group with the facilities and equipment used in its medical practice  assumes responsibility for the management of the non medical operations of the practice  and employs substantially all of the non physician personnel utilized by the group 
the company s management fee revenue is dependent upon the operating income of the physician groups 
physician group operating income is defined in the service agreements as the physician group s net medical revenues less certain contractually agreed upon clinic expenses  including non physician clinic salaries and benefits  rent  insurance  interest  and other direct clinic expenses 
the amount of the physician groups revenue retained and paid to the physician groups primarily consists of the cost of the affiliated physicians services 
the remaining amount of the physician group operating income typically and an amount equal to of the clinic expenses are reflected as management fee revenue earned by the company 
operating expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company in fulfilling its obligations under the service agreements 
these expenses are the same as the operating costs and expenses that would have been incurred by the affiliated groups  including non physician salaries  employee benefits  medical supplies  building rent  equipment leases  malpractice insurance premiums  management information systems  and other expenses related to clinic operations 
the distribution to the group for providing medical services is increased or decreased by a percentage of the physician group s surplus or deficit  respectively  in net revenue under risk sharing arrangements pursuant to capitated managed care contracts 
in addition to the clinic expenses discussed above  the company also incurs personnel and administrative expenses in connection with maintaining a corporate office function that provides management  administrative  marketing and acquisition services to the affiliated groups 
the company s profitability depends on  among other things  increasing market share  expanding healthcare services  enhancing operating efficiencies  and developing favorable contractual relationships with payors 
management believes that industry trends toward cost containment and lower reimbursement rates will continue to result in a reduction from historical levels in per patient revenue 
further reductions in reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on the company s operations unless the company is otherwise able to offset such payment reductions 
for the year ended december   four of the company s affiliated physician groups each contributed or more of the company s management fee revenue 
clinics in champaign  illinois  temple  texas  naples  florida  and abilene  texas represented approximately    and of management fee revenue  respectively 
results of operations the company commenced operations in december and affiliated with its first physician group in june and its second group in december the company entered into affiliations with five additional groups during and seven additional groups during changes in results of operations were caused primarily by affiliations with these additional physician groups

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of physician groups revenue increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increased amortization of service agreement rights obtained in the new affiliations in  as well as differences in the mix of assets acquired in connection with these affiliations

although each new affiliation will have its own specific structure  the company typically acquires current assets well in excess of the current liabilities it assumes 
cash from operations for the year ended december  amounted to million 
net income  combined with depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  and increases in accounts payable and amounts payable to affiliated physician groups provided million in cash flows 
this was offset by increases in accounts receivable  management fees receivable  due from affiliated physician groups  prepaid and other current assets and other assets and decreases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities totaling million 
this positive cash flows from operations in marked an improvement over and  in which the company experienced usage of cash in operations of million and million  respectively 
the company had aggregate cash expenditures of million and issued or committed to issue an aggregate of million shares of its common stock for the acquisition of clinic assets during the year ended december  of the cash expenditures  million was for additional physicians at existing clinics and deferred payments associated with previously completed acquisitions 
capital expenditures amounted to million for the year ended december  although each of the company s service agreements with its affiliated physician groups requires the company to provide capital for equipment  expansion  additional physicians and other major expenditures  no specific amounts have been committed in advance 
capital expenditures are made based partially upon the availability of funds  the sources of funds  alternative projects and an acceptable repayment period 
in november  the company completed an expansion of its bank credit facility from million to million 
the facility provides for working capital and acquisition financing  subject to certain restrictions 
the interest rate under this facility is  at the company s option  either the adjusted day commercial paper rate or one month libor plus to  or the bank s base rate plus to  depending on certain debt levels 
the bank credit facility  which expires january   contains certain restrictive covenants  including prohibitions on paying dividends  limitations on capital expenditures and maintenance of minimum net worth and certain financial ratios 
at december   outstanding borrowings against the bank credit facility were million and the effective interest rate was 
the company is currently in the process of further expanding its bank credit facility by another million to million and expects to complete this expansion in april in connection with the christie clinic affiliation  the company agreed to loan the physician group a total of million 
an initial loan of million was funded in november and million in december with additional loans of million to be granted each december through this note receivable is recorded in long term receivables in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the note receivable earns interest at and is an interest only loan  payable monthly  through november  after which the balance is to be paid off in annual installments through december after december  an amount equal to one twelfth of the annual amortization will be set aside by the physician group each month to fund each upcoming annual installment 
in connection with the naples affiliation  the company issued notes payable to the group totaling million 
these notes are payable in three equal annual installments in each of april  and the notes bear interest at  with interest payable in options to purchase the company s common stock at a price of per share  providing the market price for the stock is above the exercise price at the time of payment

the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition to this  the company s principal sources of liquidity are accounts receivable of million at december  and availability under the working capital portion of the bank line of credit of million 
the company believes that the combination of these sources will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs for the next twelve months 
the company s future acquisition  expansion and capital expenditure programs will require substantial amounts of capital resources 
to meet the capital needs of these programs  the company will continue to evaluate alternative sources of financing  including short and long term bank indebtedness  additional equity and other forms of financing  the availability and terms of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company
