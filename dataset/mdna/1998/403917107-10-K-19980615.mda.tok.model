the company believes that it operates in one segment for purposes of sfas year compliance the company has reviewed both its internal computer systems and its products that could be affected by the year issue and has identified some systems and a few products that will be affected 
the company presently believes  with modification to existing software and conversion to new software  the year issues relating to internal computer systems and products will not cause significant operational problems or computer problems 
furthermore  the cost of implementing these solutions is not anticipated to be material to the financial position or results of operations 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
furthermore  the costs of such conversions and updates are based on management s best estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including such things as  but not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
the company will initiate formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers in fiscal to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which significant suppliers and large customers rely upon will be timely converted  or a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems will not have a material adverse impact on the company
