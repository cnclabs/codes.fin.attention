item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company s results of operation over the three year period ended december  reflects its investment in and movement toward an anatomic pathology strategy 
several initiatives begun in and prior years  such as operational restructurings and capital investments to build the anatomic pathology product line  came to fruition in and and resulted in a dramatic improvement in the company s profitability 
results of operations o net revenues net revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing annual increases of and  respectively 
the strong revenue growth reflects the company s increased penetration in the anatomic pathology segment  offset somewhat by reimbursement pressures primarily impacting the clinical chemistry segment and somewhat reduced volume in clinical chemistry and hospital based tissue testing services 
o cost of sales cost of sales  which consists primarily of payroll  laboratory supplies  outside services  logistics shipping and handling and depreciation expense  increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales totaled  and  respectively 
the increasing percentage of revenue represented by cost of sales largely reflects the company s strategic focus on anatomic pathology 
this market segment requires a larger laboratory work force  resulting in an increase in salaries and wages from million in to million in and further to million in in addition  overhead expenses primarily building rent  utilities  and depreciation increased from million in to million in and million in these increases reflect additional facilities expenses associated with the introduction of the anatomic pathology line  and more specifically the initial expansion and equipping of the company s facilities in logistics expenses rose to million in from million in and million in due to increased volume 
cost of lab supplies decreased modestly to million in from million in  after increasing from million in due to higher volume and increased costs for reagents used in certain of the company s testing services 
however  as a percentage of sales  the cost of lab supplies decreased over the period from in to in o gross profit gross profit totaled million in versus million in and million in  while gross profit margins were  and respectively 
the increase in anatomic pathology sales as a percentage of total sales results in higher average unit pricing with lower gross margin percentages  due to the higher costs associated with providing these services 
gross margins have been further reduced due to the erosion of the average price reimbursed for certain clinical chemistry testing services 
the clinical laboratory industry  which includes both clinical chemistry and anatomic pathology  has seen steady and continuing downward pressure on prices exerted by both government and private third party payors 
also  payment for services such as those provided by the company is and likely will continue to be affected by periodic reevaluations made by payors concerning which services to reimburse and which to cease reimbursing 
the reduction in reimbursement rates  particularly by medicare  generally has decreased the average unit price for most of the company s clinical chemistry services each year 
in keeping with this trend  as part of obra and the bba  congress reduced over time the national cap on medicare laboratory fee schedules under which the company s clinical chemistry services are reimbursed 
this national cap has been lowered each year and now is of the national median 
obra also eliminated the annual updates of medicare laboratory fee schedules for the years and after updates of in and approximately in  the bba freezes fee schedule payments for the period 
with respect to the company s anatomic pathology services  which are not reimbursed under the medicare laboratory fee schedules  the medicare fees for these services also generally declined with the implementation of the rbrvs system which went into effect in and was fully phased in by the end of in  there was an overall decrease of in payments for pathology services due to a five year review of the work value component and a decrease in the conversion factor applicable to pathology services  plus an additional decrease in connecticut  where the company s primary operations are located  because of the health care financing administration s hcfa reduction of the number of different payment localities recognized for rbrvs purposes 
although the conversion factor which is a component of the reimbursement calculation increased by in  the overall impact on the company s revenues will be only modestly positive due to  among other factors  other changes in the rbrvs formula in other changes in government and other third party payor reimbursement  which may come about as a consequence of enactment of health care reform or of deficit reduction or balanced budget legislation  are also likely to continue the downward pressure on prices and make the market for clinical laboratory services more competitive 
the provisions of the bba that permit beneficiaries to select non traditional medicare plan options  implement competitive bidding for certain medicare items and services  and establish market oriented purchasing for medicare  previously described in the reimbursement section  are examples 
because of the uncertainties about how these medicare changes will be implemented  the company currently is unable to predict their ultimate impact on the clinical laboratory industry generally or on the company in particular 
even apart from federal legislative action  reforms may occur at the state level and changes are occurring in the marketplace as a result of market pressures  including the increasing number of patients covered by some form of managed care 
in the past  the company has offset a substantial portion of the impact of price decreases and coverage changes through the achievement of economies of scale and other strategies such as more favorable purchase contracts and the introduction of alternative technologies 
however  if price decreases for example arising from the medicare changes discussed above or coverage changes were to be rapidly and fully implemented  they would be likely to have an adverse impact on gross profits from the company s testing services until management was able to mitigate such impact 
furthermore  in recent years the company s gross profit margin has trended down from over to  and there can be no assurances that such trends may not continue

o selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  with another modest increase in to million 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased over the period from in to in  as the company began to realize operating leverage in this area 
selling expenses were million in  or of sales  versus million in and million in  or and of sales  respectively 
the decrease in selling expenses was offset somewhat by growth in general and administrative expenses 
in addition  reflects the impact of several charges of a non recurring nature recorded by the company  including i a  accelerated amortization charge based on management s estimate of future benefits anticipated from a customer list  ii a severance charge of  resulting from the streamlining of operating expenses and the resignation of certain officers of the company  iii a  write down of an investment in common stock of a publicly traded company which was subsequently written off in with a  charge  and iv a  restructuring provision related to management s decision to discontinue the company s european based operations 
o research and development research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in and million in the higher expense in and reflects the costs associated with launching the anatomic pathology testing services  including the cost of building the company s database 
the reduction in reflects the completion of this launch  and the resulting expense primarily represents the company s continuing evaluation of existing and new technologies 
o income from operations income from operations increased from approximately  in to million in and million in  reflecting the factors discussed above and especially the company s investment in  and shift toward  an anatomic pathology strategy 
o net interest income net interest income grew to  in  from  in and  in this reflects the increased cash and cash equivalent position of the company over the period  partially resulting from cash generated by operations and partially resulting from the private placement in as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
o provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from  in to million in and million in  reflecting the increased profitability of the company 
the effective tax rate was  and  respectively  with the high tax rate in reflecting the non deductibility of certain charges  primarily the aforementioned investment write down of  o net income net income increased to million in  from million in and  in the dramatic profitability improvements reflect the company s investment in and shift toward an anatomic pathology strategy 
basic earnings per share increased in to per share  from per share in and per share in diluted earnings per share increased in to per share  from per share in and per share in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total cash and cash equivalents of million  substantially all of which was invested in a fund holding us treasury securities with maturities of less than three months 
working capital was million versus million as of december   and the current ratios were and  respectively 
accounts receivable net of allowances totaled million as of december  representing approximately days of average sales  compared to million as of december  or days of average sales 
the increase in days sales outstanding is a result of growth in the anatomic pathology segment and its associated billing complexity which results in a higher dso 
capital expenditures for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in primarily related to the expansion of the company s laboratory facilities and the purchase of a new mainframe computer system
