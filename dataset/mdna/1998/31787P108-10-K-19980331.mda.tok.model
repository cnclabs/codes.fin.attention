for further explanation of the operating effect of the thompson acquisition  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
the company s sales and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter due to various factors and the company expects these fluctuations to continue 
among these factors are seasonal buying patterns of the company s customers and the timing of acquisitions 
historically  outlet sales have slowed in the late fall and winter of each year largely due to inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance for the company s outlets is generally lower during the december and march quarters compared to the june and september quarters 
in addition  the timing of acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company takes advantage of periodic special incentive programs available from suppliers which extend the due date of purchases beyond terms normally available with large volume purchases 
the timing of these programs can contribute to fluctuations in the company s quarterly cash flow 
although the company continues to investigate strategies to smooth the seasonal pattern of its quarterly results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s net sales  results of operations and cash flow will not continue to display these seasonal patterns 
inflation and other economic factors inflation affects finishmaster s costs of materials sold  salaries and other related costs of distribution 
to the extent permitted by competition  finishmaster has offset these higher costs of materials through selective price increases 
the company s business may be negatively affected by cyclical economic downturns in the markets in which it operates 
in addition  markets in the van conversion industry may increase the cyclical nature of the company s operations 
sales in this market accounted for approximately of sales for the periods reported 
there is no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected in the future by cyclical downturns in its markets 
the company s financial performance is also dependent on its ability to acquire businesses and profitably integrate them into their operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity based instruments at december  a review of the company s other financial instruments and risk exposures at december  indicated that the company had exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the company concluded that near term changes to interest rates should not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other discussion regarding the company s business risks is presented in item business on this form k

cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period of the prior year

in addition  cash was used for large inventory buys at year end in advance of price increases 
cash of million was provided by accounts receivable reductions for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period of the prior year

inventory at december  included approximately million attributable to large year end buys

the company intends to satisfy this requirement through an acquisition of ldi autopaints autopaints in exchange for equity in the company 
the company is currently pursuing other financing arrangements 
should the company be successful in implementing favorable financing terms  proceeds will be used to retire certain bank term loans  a portion of outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the subordinated debt payable to ldi 
early retirement of indebtedness will result in an extraordinary loss in the amount of the net book value of capitalized debt issue costs 
at december  unamortized debt issue costs were approximately million
