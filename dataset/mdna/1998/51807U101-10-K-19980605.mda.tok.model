item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and revenues the company s total revenues for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal product sales 
sales of lasercard r optical memory cards and related products to value added resellers vars  licensees  and end user customers were  for fiscal versus  for fiscal and  for fiscal the increase in sales between fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from united states government orders totalling million optical memory cards 
of these  approximately million cards were delivered during fiscal deliveries under these us government orders are expected to continue at an average of more than  cards per month through december of the difference between fiscal and fiscal revenues was due mainly to an order from the us department of defense dod for reader writer units in fiscal versus units for that customer in fiscal  for an ongoing dod program 
optical memory card sales in fiscal   and were million cards   cards  and  cards  respectively 
applications for the company s lasercard products include medical data applications in the united states  various programs in europe and asia  several programs in the philippines including an admission pass retail purchase log at a duty free shopping zone and a vehicle warranty and maintenance records card  and us government related programs  including the us department of defense automated manifest card  the us immigration and naturalization service green card  and the us department of state laser visa border crossing card 
the company sold lasercard products in fiscal to approximately customers in seven states and foreign countries 
the company utilizes var companies for the development of commercial markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars include the company s optical memory cards  the company s system software  and optical card reader writers made by a licensee of the company  and may include add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products  integrated into data systems  for end user customers 
there can be no assurances that any new or existing var company in any country will be successful in its markets or field trials or that it will place follow on orders with the company for additional quantities of cards and systems 
in order to upgrade its var customer base to increase the probability of success  the company will continue its efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive ones 
the company provides marketing leads  customer technical support  and system software to assist vars 
software is an important factor in developing the commercial markets for optical memory cards 
the company s system software consists of optical card interface software device drivers  file systems  software development tools  and demonstration software 
the company does not provide software for specific applications  but instead depends on its vars to integrate optical card products into existing software products  write new application software for specific optical card programs  or license software from other vars 
several vars have written optical card software programs for applications such as automobile warranty and maintenance records  cargo manifesting  digital optical key systems  admissions id  data logging systems  and various medical related applications such as medical image storage and health history cards 
other application software development is underway by vars and their customers 
optical memory cards are used in conjunction with card reader writer equipment connected to personal computers and accessed in the same manner as floppy disk drives 
such reader writers are sold to vars and other customers of the company 
the price  performance  and availability of such reader writers are factors in the commercialization of optical cards 
the company sells reader writers for a few thousand dollars per unit  and these units generally include the company s interface software device drivers 
the company does not manufacture card reader writers but instead continues to purchase such equipment from a japanese licensee  nippon conlux co  ltd  currently the company s sole supplier of reader writers 
the company s inventory level for reader writers fluctuates from zero up to approximately units based on the timing of purchases and sales 
the company can give no assurance that increased production of card reader writers will occur in the near term or that high volume sales and correspondingly lower prices will result 
if market demand increases sharply over a short period of time  an initial shortage of reader writers could result 
also  an interruption or change in the supply of reader writers could cause a delay in both reader writer and optical memory card shipments and a possible loss of sales  which would adversely affect operating results 
workstation revenues 
the company recorded fiscal revenues of  for the delivery of six prototype multi technology card readers multi card workstations for an existing customer 
these multi card workstations can write and or read cards with one or more of the following technologies optical memory stripe  ic chip  magnetic stripe  ocr b optical character recognition  and dimensional bar code 
costs for the development and manufacture of these workstations were charged to cost of sales 
there were no revenues of this type in fiscal or license revenues 
revenues from license fees were  in fiscal and  in fiscal the license fee payments were received in the respective fiscal periods 
there were no license fee revenues in fiscal the fiscal license agreement included a trademark license and a lasercard distribution license payment 
the fiscal agreement licensed the company s canadian patent covering motion picture digital sound  with certain rights for conversion to other license rights 
license fees received by the company are unconditional and nonrefundable  and no significant obligations remain unfulfilled by the company under any of its licenses 
the company no longer relies on license fees to finance operations 
royalty revenues 
royalty revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company cannot predict whether or when equipment or card sales by its licensees will result in material royalties to the company 
therefore  the company is not relying on royalty income and does not expect it to be a significant factor in the near term 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards was approximately million 
deliveries are estimated to be at an average of  cards or more per month through about december about of the backlog is for us government orders  as is the case in all us government procurement  the government reserves the right to change specifications  delay deliveries  and cancel all or part of the orders 
margins the combined gross margin of product sales and workstation contract revenues for fiscal was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal  due largely to the increase in card sales volume 
with the increase in card manufacturing for customer orders  the company s optical memory card manufacturing facility is used less for the purposes of research and engineering 
therefore  more of the manufacturing facility costs depreciation expense  building lease payments  and other costs are allocated to cost of card manufacturing  and less of these costs are charged to research and engineering 
for fiscal  the company allocated substantially all of the facility expenses to card manufacturing versus approximately and  respectively  of these expenses for fiscal years and income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
fiscal year sg a expenses were  compared with  and  respectively  for fiscal and the majority of the increases for fiscal and versus prior years is attributable to increased payroll and marketing expenses 
sg a spending is expected to increase during fiscal due to increased marketing and customer technical support activities 
research and engineering expenses 
research and engineering expenses  excluding customer funded engineering programs  were  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the expense reduction is due primarily to accounting for facility costs rather than an actual reduction in research and engineering 
the optical memory card facility is used for both engineering and manufacturing 
therefore  the facility costs depreciation expense  building lease payments  and other costs are allocated between manufacturing and engineering based upon the level of activity in the respective areas 
substantially all of these expenses were allocated to card production during fiscal because of the substantial increase in card production to meet orders 
during fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of these expenses were allocated to card production 
the company continues to undertake ongoing research and engineering project activities related to optical memory cards 
future projects will require increased spending as the optical card industry grows 
other income and expense 
other income for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the company purchases japanese yen for payment of reader writers purchased from a japanese supplier 
thus  the company s normal operations are subject to gains or losses on fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
net other income for fiscal included a  gain on foreign currency exchange versus a  gain for fiscal there was no income of this type for fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company received a  nonrefundable deposit toward a license agreement 
the license agreement was not consummated and the deposit was forfeited by the licensee 
the income from the forfeiture of the deposit is recorded as other income in fiscal there was no income of this type for fiscal or fiscal interest income for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the changes in interest income for each year were due generally to changes in average invested funds 
the company s interest expense on short term loans was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal liquidity as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  a current ratio of to  and no long term debt 
net cash used for operating activities was  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the current level of revenues is sufficient to generate cash from operations after expenses 
fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities will use cash in some quarters and provide cash in other quarters 
losses could recur if us government orders decrease and there are delays in other customers development of optical card based programs and corresponding commercialization of the company s optical cards and related products 
the company has not established a line of credit and has no current plans to do so 
the company may negotiate a line of credit if and when it becomes appropriate  although no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  if needed 
as a result of the profit recorded for fiscal  the company s accumulated deficit was reduced to  at march  during fiscal  stockholders equity increased by  to  due to the  profit  the  net of expenses received by the company from the sale of  shares of common stock in private placement transactions in october of  and  received by the company for stock issued during fiscal under the employee stock purchase plan and the stock option plan 
the company s total deferred income tax asset was  at march  if utilized  the total deferred income tax asset would reduce future tax expense and payments 
included are amounts derived from federal income tax net operating losses that will expire at various dates from through  amounts from state income tax net operating losses that will expire at various dates from through  and amounts from tax credits that will expire from through  except for alternative minimum tax credits which have no expiration 
the ability of the company to utilize this deferred tax asset is contingent upon generating sufficient income within the stated time periods 
in view of the uncertain value of this asset  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against it  therefore  no part of the total deferred tax asset of  has been added to stockholders equity on the company s balance sheet 
the company is planning to install an additional million of capital equipment and leasehold improvements in its card production facility by the end of september these assets are for the production of advanced optical cards with new features and for manufacturing process improvements and will result in a production capacity of million cards annually 
the company believes that an additional investment of about million to million in production equipment and automatic inspection equipment may be required to produce the more advanced optical cards at a rate of up to million cards per year 
currently  the company intends to purchase such equipment incrementally as commercial orders for optical memory cards justify increased production capacity 
in addition to the investment used for expansion  the company also will make additional capital expenditures for cost savings  quality improvements  and other purposes 
during fiscal  company employees and consultants purchased from the company  shares of registered common stock  at an average price of per share  through the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plan  which resulted in additional cash receipts to the company of  as of march   company employees and consultants held unexercised  vested  in the money options to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  for a weighted average of per share 
these stock options  if exercised  would provide the company with cash in the amount of  new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains  and losses in financial statements 
sfas requires classification of other comprehensive income in a financial statement  and the display of the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes this pronouncement will not have a material effect on its financial statements 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this pronouncement established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports to shareholders 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged 
the company has yet to determine the impact  if any  of adoption of this new pronouncement
