profitability  however  continues to follow a more seasonal pattern due to the higher margins and efficiency during the christmas production season and lower margins in the first quarter that do not fully leverage fixed depreciation  amortization  interest and preferred dividend costs that are incurred evenly throughout the year

year as a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is currently working to determine and resolve any potential impact of this issue on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized operations and information systems 
based on a recent assessment  the company has determined that it will need to modify or replace certain portions of its software to process such information correctly 
the company believes that such modifications or replacements will mitigate the potential impact of the date recognition issue  although if such modifications are not made or not completed timely  there could be a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company or its systems rely will be converted timely 
similarly  there can be no guarantee that a failure of another company s systems to work compatibly with the company s systems or to provide necessary resources would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of big flower and its subsidiaries 
the company is working with its customers to make necessary modifications to the products columbine has sold and believes that it has no significant exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for those products 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace systems and test them for year compliance 
the company plans to complete any necessary modifications on a timely basis 
the total cost of the assessment mentioned above has not been material to the company s operating results 
at this time  projected expenditures for modifications  testing and capital expenditures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the costs of the project and the planned completion dates are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the availability of certain resources  third party modifications and other factors 
there can be no guarantee  however  that these estimates will be achieved and actual circumstances could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
