general midcoast energy resources  inc  its subsidiaries and affiliated companies referred to collectively as the company or midcoast is primarily engaged in the transportation  gathering  processing and marketing of natural gas and other petroleum products 
the company owns and operates two interstate transmission pipeline systems  three intrastate transmission systems  end user systems and gathering systems representing over  miles of pipeline with an aggregate daily throughput capacity of over bcf day 
the company s principal business consists of providing transportation services through its pipelines to both end users and natural gas producers  providing natural gas marketing services to these customers and processing natural gas 
in connection with these services  the company acquires and constructs pipelines to supply natural gas directly to industrial and municipal end users and provides access to pipeline systems for natural gas producers through its gathering systems 
the company s principal assets are located in the gulf coast area and include i a mile interstate transmission pipeline and two end user pipelines in northern alabama  mississippi and southern tennessee collectively  the mit systems  ii a mile interstate transmission pipeline along with one intrastate  two end user pipelines and two offshore gathering pipelines  located in louisiana collectively  the midla systems  iii a mile natural gas transmission and gathering pipeline in the black warrior basin of central alabama the magnolia system and iv a mile natural gas gathering pipeline and sour gas processing plant in mississippi the harmony system 
midcoast was incorporated as a nevada corporation in midcoast leases its principal executive offices at louisiana  suite  houston  texas  and its telephone number is midcoast also owns or leases other regional offices in alabama  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
business growth strategy the company s principal business strategy is to increase its earnings and cash flow by acquiring or constructing pipeline systems  aggressively pursuing end user customers  increasing the utilization of its existing pipeline systems and processing plants in order to enhance the company s profitability and improving cost efficiencies 
the company implements its strategy through the following steps acquisition or construction of pipeline and processing systems 
the company seeks to acquire or construct natural gas transmission  end user  gathering and processing systems which offer the opportunity for increased utilization and expansion of the system due to their proximity to geographic areas where municipal and industrial demand for natural gas is growing or where drilling activity is expected to increase 
the company seeks to acquire or construct additional transmission and gathering systems or processing facilities in its core geographic areas of operation when the company believes such additional systems will enhance the overall profitability of the area of operation 
focus on end users 
as a result of recent regulatory changes  natural gas customers have more flexibility to negotiate their natural gas purchase and transportation contracts 
the company actively pursues direct sales to these end users  such as industrial plants and municipalities  which are seeking alternative supplies to meet their energy needs 
the company seeks to build pipeline systems directly connecting these customers to transmission systems and to enter into long term transportation agreements that provide the company with a stable  non depletive gas throughput and cash flow 
the company also offers gas marketing services to its end user customers who typically incur a reduced transportation cost by receiving natural gas through a company owned pipeline 
utilization of existing systems capacity 
after a system is acquired or constructed  the company begins an aggressive marketing effort to fully utilize the system s capacity 
as part of this process  the company focuses on providing quality service to its end user and natural gas producer customers 
many of the company s existing pipeline and processing systems were designed with excess throughput capacity that provide the company with opportunities to pursue additional gas volumes with little incremental capital cost and to provide higher margin swing sales during periods of increased gas demand 
cost efficiencies 
the company generally seeks to achieve administrative and operational efficiencies by reducing overhead  increasing utilization of equipment and personnel  capitalizing on the geographic proximity of many of its systems and further integrating gas transmission and marketing services 
the company also seeks to acquire or construct additional transmission and gathering systems or processing facilities in its core geographic areas of operation where it can achieve administrative or operational efficiencies when integrated with the company s existing systems 
the company actively focuses on eliminating duplicative efforts  to install advanced technologies and control systems and other efficiency targeted projects which will help to minimize costs and enhance the company s flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities 
pipeline acquisitions and construction since the first quarter of  the company has acquired ownership of or interests in pipelines  of which occurred in of the total  five are transmission lines  are end user pipelines and are gathering systems 
during this time  the company has expanded into the interstate pipeline and natural gas processing markets with their acquisitions of the midla  mit and harmony systems 
the following is a summary of the company s acquisition and construction activities during acquisitions the mit systems 
consistent with the company s business strategy  in may  midcoast acquired the mit systems and their related pipeline and energy services operations from atrion corporation atrion for cash consideration of million and up to million in contingent deferred payments the mit acquisition 
the acquisition was initially funded through the company s existing credit facility 
subsequently the proceeds from the company s common stock offering on july  were used to retire the indebtedness incurred on the mit acquisition 
the mit operations include i a mile interstate transmission pipeline located in northern alabama  mississippi and southern tennessee which transports natural gas to industrial and municipal customers the mit system  ii a mile and a one mile pipeline in northern alabama which primarily serve two large industrial customers the champion system and monsanto system  respectively and iii a natural gas marketing company which primarily serves customers of the mit systems 
the midla systems 
in october  the company completed its merger of republic gas partners llc republic  which owned mid louisiana gas company mlgc  mid louisiana gas transmission company mlgt and mid louisiana marketing company  for cash consideration of million  the assumption of approximately million in bank indebtedness   shares of midcoast common stock  par value 
per share common stock  warrants to acquire  shares of common stock and an additional  warrants to acquire common stock subject to certain contingencies which were later met the midla acquisition 
the midla systems include i a mile interstate gas pipeline which runs from the monroe gas field in northern louisiana  southward through mississippi to baton rouge  louisiana mlgc system  ii one intrastate and two end user gas pipelines with a collective length of miles and iii two offshore lateral gas pipelines with a collective length of miles the t and t systems 
also acquired in the midla acquisition were two compressor stations with a total of  horsepower 
these pipelines serve a number of large industrial markets and municipalities including entergy gulf states inc  the local distribution company for baton rouge  mississippi valley gas company  the local distribution company for natchez  mississippi and several surrounding communities  international paper co 
s facility near natchez  louisana and exxon chemical america s complex near baton rogue  louisana  the crown vantage inc s st 
francisville plant in west feliciana parish  louisana and the farmland industries inc s plant in grant parish  louisiana 
both the mit acquisition and midla acquisition complement the company s existing operations in the gulf coast area  which include the magnolia system  the harmony system and numerous other gathering and transmission systems 
the company believes there are significant opportunities for increasing the utilization of the mit and midla systems 
since these acquisitions  midcoast has succeeded in increasing contracted firm transportation volumes on the mit system by for the winter season  through the completion of two successful open seasons  and has negotiated new long term marketing  services to an industrial facility near port hudson  louisiana  as well as  mmcf day of natural gas transportation and mmcf day of natural gas marketing services to a new cogeneration facility near baton rouge subject to the construction of additional pipelines facilities scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of the raymond system 
in march  midcoast acquired a controlling interest in the raymond system in south central kansas from mapco natural gas liquids  inc the system was acquired in exchange for the cat springs and stratton ridge systems that were previously owned by midcoast 
the raymond system consists of a compressor station and approximately miles of to pipeline located in mcpherson  rice  barton and stafford counties  in kansas 
the system gathers natural gas from producers across leases for delivery into mapco s conway fractionation facility 
construction harmony system 
a 
million expansion of the harmony plant was completed in the fourth quarter of the expansion added five miles of gathering pipeline that connects to four producing wells 
as a result of the expansion  the incremental deliveries into the harmony plant have increased natural gas liquid ngl sales and residue gas sales by approximately and  respectively 
mit system 
the company has filed an application with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for the approval of a million expansion of the mit system consisting of the construction of a mile pipeline and related looping facility in colbert county  alabama 
the pipeline construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of midla systems 
the company embarked on a million high pressure pipeline construction project in as a result of new marketing and transportation contracts to service exxon chemical america s cogeneration facility in baton rouge and georgia pacific s port hudson paper plant 
the new pipeline is designed to accommodate other potential customers that have operations along the proposed construction route 
the project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of the company further intends to pursue new construction and acquisition opportunities in this core geographic area through the acquisition of additional transmission systems that interconnect to or otherwise provide synergies with the midla or mit systems as well as the company s other existing pipeline systems in the region 
the company intends to continue to pursue cost saving measures while emphasizing its gas marketing efforts throughout this region 
the company plans to continue to evaluate investments in pipelines which involve not only natural gas  but also liquified petroleum gas  as well as both hydrocarbon and non hydrocarbon gases 
management believes that more acquisition opportunities will become available as major pipeline companies divest of their existing systems due to regulatory considerations or need to spin off smaller non strategic systems acquired in connection with larger acquisitions 
the company believes it can capitalize on these opportunities due to the strategic locations of its pipelines and proximity to other companies pipeline systems and in large part to the company s experience and relationships with others in the pipeline industry 
operations substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from transportation fees from pipeline systems owned by the company  the processing and treating of natural gas and the marketing of natural gas 
the company s various operations involve the following activities mainline transmission 
the company s transmission pipelines primarily receive and deliver natural gas to and from other pipelines  and secondarily involve some end user or gathering functions 
transportation fees are received by the company for transporting gas owned by other parties through the company s pipeline systems 
the company has greatly expanded its transmission pipeline activities with the magnolia  mit and midla acquisitions in august  may and october  respectively 
the company seeks to further expand its activities in this area through the acquisition or construction of natural gas transmission pipelines in its core geographic areas of operation where operational synergies and market opportunities exist or in new geographic regions where there is increasing demand for gas by municipal and industrial users 
the company owns two interstate and three intrastate transmission pipelines 
end user transmission 
the company also contracts with industrial end users  municipalities or electrical generating facilities to provide natural gas and natural gas transportation services to their facilities through interconnect gas pipelines constructed or acquired by the company 
these pipelines provide a supply of natural gas to new industrial facilities or to existing facilities as an alternative energy source 
the company intends to continue to pursue direct sales to these end users who have more flexibility in recent years to negotiate their gas purchase and transportation contracts as a result of industry deregulation 
frequently  the company is able to offer its end user customers rates lower than the customer s current energy supplier 
the company s contracts with end user customers typically provide for the payment of a transportation fee by the customer based on the volume of natural gas transported through the company s pipeline 
the company strives to structure the terms and transportation fees for its end user systems in such a way as to provide an acceptable rate of return regardless of any natural gas marketing revenues 
the company owns interests in end user pipelines 
gathering 
the company s gathering systems typically consist of a network of small diameter pipelines which collect natural gas or crude oil from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission 
gathering systems may include meters  separators  dehydration facilities and other treating equipment owned by the company or others 
the company derives revenues from gathering systems by transporting natural gas or crude oil owned by others through its pipelines for a transportation fee  by purchasing natural gas and utilizing its pipelines to transport the natural gas to a customer in another location where the natural gas is resold or  in certain instances  by purchasing natural gas and arranging for the delivery and resale of an equivalent quantity of natural gas to a customer not directly served by the company s pipelines 
transactions with customers not directly served by the company s pipelines are typically accomplished by entering into agreements whereby the company exchanges natural gas in its pipelines for natural gas in the pipelines of other transmission companies 
the company intends to pursue the construction of additional gas gathering systems in or near its core geographic operating areas and where drilling activity is expected to provide opportunities for the expansion of gathering or processing facilities 
the company currently owns an interest in and operates gathering systems 
natural gas processing 
the company s natural gas processing revenues are realized from the extraction and sale of ngls as well as the sale of the residual natural gas 
once extracted the ngls are further fractionated in the company s facilities into products such as ethane  propane  butanes  natural gasoline and condensate and then sold to various wholesalers along with raw sulphur from the company s sulphur recovery plant 
the company  in most instances  enters into agreements with natural gas producers wherein the company and the producer share in the revenue generated from the sale of the ngls and natural gas extracted at the company s facilities 
the company entered the natural gas processing business in october with its purchase of the harmony system  in central mississippi 
the company intends to pursue expansion of the harmony system through the construction of additional interconnections with wells in the area 
gas marketing 
historically  the company s gas marketing activities have been focused on the company s systems with a strategic focus to provide quality and consistent service to its customers connected to the company s pipeline network 
as a result of the mit and midla acquisitions  the company has greatly expanded its natural gas marketing activities in the alabama mississippi and louisiana areas 
the company s marketing activities include providing natural gas supply and sales services to some of its end user customers by purchasing the natural gas supply from other marketers or pipeline affiliates and reselling the natural gas to the end user 
the company also purchases natural gas directly from well operators on many of the company s gathering systems and resells the natural gas to other marketers or pipeline affiliates 
many of the contracts pertaining to the company s gas marketing activities are month to month spot market transactions with numerous gas suppliers or producers in the industry 
the company also offers other gas services to the customers of its mit and midla systems  such as management of capacity release  storage service and gas balancing 
the company intends to further enhance its increased natural gas marketing presence in its core geographic areas of operation through an aggressive marketing program focused on end users need for additional supplies 
typically  the company purchases natural gas at a price determined by prevailing market conditions 
simultaneous with the purchase of natural gas by the company  the company generally resells natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract which is comparable in its terms to the purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
in most instances  natural gas marketing is characterized by small margins since there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity who compete with the company in the marketing of natural gas 
the profitability of the natural gas marketing operations of the company depends in large part on the ability of the company s management to assess and respond to changing market conditions in negotiating these natural gas purchase and sale agreements 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices there has been a reluctance of end users to enter into long term purchase contracts 
moreover  consumers have shown an increased willingness to switch fuels between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
the inability of management to respond appropriately in changing market conditions could have a negative effect on the company s profitability 
accordingly  historical operating income associated with this revenue stream has varied depending on market conditions 
the company s gas marketing activities which utilize third party transporters also exposes the company to economic risk resulting from imbalances or nominated volume discrepancies which can result either in penalties having a negative impact on earnings or a transaction gain  depending on how and when imbalances are corrected 
the company believes the marketing of natural gas is an important complement to its transportation services 
major customers the company s principal customers are industrial end users  municipalities  resellers and producers of natural gas 
the company typically enters into one to five year transportation agreements which may also include provisions regarding guaranteed minimum volumes and price reductions after the customer meets certain transportation commitments 
the company also enters into marketing agreements with many of its customers related to gas supply and other services 
for its ferc regulated entities  the company enters into transportation contracts regarding firm and interruptible transportation using the tariff rates approved by ferc 
in certain situations  the company has offered discounts from its tariffs in response to specific market conditions 
key customers under these contracts  representing in excess of of the company s gross margin  on a pro forma basis include champion and entergy gulf states  inc gross margin represents transportation revenues earned in transmission contracts and the difference between the contract price of the gas purchased and the contract price of the gas sold 
the agreement with champion  which expires in  provides for mmcf day of firm transportation and a rate reduction of in the event that champion meets a minimum transportation volume  which is expected to occur in based on champion s current usage 
the agreements with entergy gulf states  inc  expire in and  for marketing and transportation services  respectively 
the marketing agreement provides for volumes which range from  mmbtu s to  mmbtu s day 
the marketing agreement will renew on an annual period after the primary expiration 
the transportation agreement provides for volumes which range from  mmbtu s to  mmbtu s day 
the agreement will renew on an annual period after the primary expiration 
competition the natural gas transportation  gathering  processing and marketing industries are highly competitive 
in marketing natural gas  the company has numerous competitors  including marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines  major integrated oil companies  and local and national natural gas gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
many of these competitors  particularly those affiliated with major integrated oil and interstate and intrastate pipeline companies  have financial resources substantially greater than those available to the company 
local utilities and distributors of natural gas are  in some cases  engaged directly  and through affiliates  in marketing activities that compete with the company 
some of the company s contracts are month to month arrangements and as such  these agreements are affected by existing competition in the natural gas markets at the time of sale as well as competition for the cost of natural gas supplies 
the company competes against other companies in the transmission  gathering and marketing businesses for supplies of natural gas and for sales customers 
competition for natural gas supplies is primarily based on efficiency  reliability  availability of transportation and the ability to offer a competitive price for natural gas 
competition for customers is primarily based upon reliability and price of deliverable natural gas 
for customers that have the capability of using alternative fuels  such as oil and coal  the company also competes against companies capable of providing these alternative fuels at a competitive price 
natural gas supply the company s transmission and end user pipelines have connections with major interstate and intrastate pipelines which management believes have ample supplies of natural gas in excess of the volumes required for these systems 
however  these purchase contracts may be affected by factors beyond both the company s and the gas suppliers control such as capacity constraints  temporary regional supply shortages  and  with regard to its gathering systems  other parties having control over the drilling of new wells  inability of wells to deliver gas at required pipeline quality and pressure  and depletion of reserves 
the future performance of the company will depend to a great extent on the throughput levels achieved by the company with respect to its existing pipelines and the pipelines acquired or constructed by it in the future 
in order to maintain the throughput on its gathering systems at current levels  the company must access new natural gas supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves as such supplies are produced 
in connection with the construction and acquisition of its gathering systems  evaluations were made of well and reservoir data furnished by producers to determine the availability of natural gas supply for the systems 
based on those evaluations  it is management s belief that there should be adequate natural gas supply for the company to recoup its investment with an adequate rate of return 
as such  management does not routinely obtain independent evaluation of reserves dedicated to its systems due to the cost of such evaluations 
accordingly  the company does not have estimates of total reserves dedicated to its systems or the anticipated life of such producing reserves 
rate and regulatory matters various aspects of the transportation of natural gas are subject to or affected by extensive federal regulation under the natural gas act nga  the natural gas policy act of ngpa  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of decontrol act and regulations promulgated by the ferc 
historically  interstate pipeline companies acted as wholesale merchants by purchasing natural gas from producers  transporting that natural gas from the fields to their markets  and reselling the natural gas to local distribution companies and large end users 
prior to the enactment of the ngpa in and the decontrol act of  all sales of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce  including sales by producers  were subject to the rates and service jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga and ngpa 
however  as a result of the ngpa and the decontrol act  all so called first sales of natural gas were federally deregulated  thus allowing all types of non pipeline and non local distribution sellers to market their natural gas free from federal controls 
moreover  pursuant to section of the ngpa section  the ferc promulgated regulations by which wholly intrastate natural gas pipeline companies could engage in interstate transactions without becoming subject to the ferc s full rates and service jurisdiction under the nga 
at the same time  however  the ferc has retained its traditional jurisdiction over the activities of interstate pipelines 
thus  under the nga and ngpa  the transportation and resale of natural gas by interstate pipeline companies have been subject to extensive regulation  and the construction of new facilities  the extension of existing facilities  and the commencement and cessation of sales  resales or transportation services by pipeline companies generally have required prior ferc authorization 
commencing in with the promulgation of order no 
 the ferc adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation  sale and marketing of natural gas 
these changes were intended to foster competition in the natural gas industry by  among other things  transforming the role of the interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to primarily natural gas transporters  and mandating that interstate pipeline companies provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation services to all producers  distributors  marketers and other shippers that seek such services so called open access requirements 
as an incentive to cause the interstate pipeline companies to revamp their services  the ferc also sought to expedite the certification process for new services  facilities  and operations of those pipeline companies providing open access services 
throughout the early years of this process  the ferc s actions in these areas were subject to extensive judicial review and generated significant industry comment and proposals for modification to existing regulations 
in  the ferc issued its most comprehensive restructuring ruling  order  a complex regulation that has had a major impact on natural gas pipeline operations  services and rates 
among other things  order generally required each interstate pipeline company to unbundle its traditional wholesale services and make available on an open and nondiscriminatory basis numerous constituent services such as gathering services  storage services  and firm and interruptible transportation services and to adopt a new rate making methodology to determine appropriate rates for those services 
to the extent the pipeline company or its sales affiliate makes natural gas sales as a merchant in the future  it will do so pursuant to a blanket sales certificate that puts those entities in direct competition with all other sellers pursuant to private contracts  however  pipeline companies were not required by order to remain merchants of natural gas  and several of the interstate pipeline companies have elected to become transporters only 
the ferc required that each pipeline company develop the specific terms of service in individual pipeline restructuring proceedings by means of a compliance filing that set forth the pipeline company s new  detailed procedures 
in subsequent orders  the ferc largely affirmed the significant features of order and denied requests for stay of the implementation of the new rules pending judicial review 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the dc circuit largely upheld order  but did remand certain aspects of order to the ferc for further explanation including  inter alia  the right of first refusal mechanism and the eligibility of customers to receive no notice transportation service 
on february   the ferc issued order no 
c  its order on remand from the dc circuit 
order no 
c is currently pending on rehearing before the ferc 
orders approving the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings  however  are the subject of numerous appeals to the united states court of appeals 
the outcome of such proceedings and the ultimate impact that they may have on the company s business is uncertain 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that such regulations will be effective in meeting their goals of creating a level playing field for all natural gas buyers and sellers 
ferc could issue new regulations which may subject some portion of the company s unregulated business activity to ferc regulation  subject the mit and midla system to additional regulation or adversely affect the conduct of the company s business 
in late and early  the ferc issued a series of orders incorporating certain business practice standards of interstate pipelines which was intended to establish a more efficient and integrated pipeline grid which will reduce the variations in pipeline business practices and allow customers to obtain and transport gas from all potential sources of supply more easily and efficiently 
certain aspects of these orders are currently pending on appeal before the dc circuit 
interstate pipeline regulation 
the mit and mlgc operations constitute the operations of a natural gas company  as defined in the nga 
as such  they are subject to the jurisdiction of ferc 
the interstate pipeline operations of mit and mlgc are operated pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity and other authorization issued under the nga and pursuant to the ngpa 
ferc regulates the interstate transportation and certain sales of natural gas  including among other things  rates and charges allowed natural gas companies  extensions and abandonment of facilities and service  rates of depreciation and amortization and certain accounting methods utilized by mit and mlgc 
pipeline rates for mit and mlgc must be filed and approved by ferc  and such rates are typically submitted as cost based in order to be deemed to be just and reasonable 
ferc may suspend for up to five months the effectiveness of rate changes filed by the pipeline  and thereafter permit the changed rate to go into effect subject to refund 
ferc may require the pipeline to refund  with interest  all or any portion of any increased amount that it finds not to be just and reasonable 
ferc also may investigate  either on its own motion or pursuant to protests by third parties  the lawfulness of pipeline rates that are on file 
on april   the mit system increased its jurisdictional rates from rates that had been in effect since april this rate increase was agreed to in an uncontested settlement with the mit system s customers which the ferc approved on december  that agreement was amended in september to eliminate the requirement that the mit system file a new rate case in september or any year thereafter 
as part of that agreement  the mit system reduced its rates by effective september  on june   the mlgc system proposed a decrease in its jurisdictional rates from rates that had been in effect since this rate decrease was agreed to in an uncontested settlement with mlgc s customers and was certified to the ferc by the presiding administrative law judge on november  accordingly  the ferc approved the settlement by letter order dated march  intrastate pipeline regulation 
the company s intrastate pipeline operations  are generally not subject to regulation by the ferc  but are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which the company operates 
the magnolia system is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc with respect to the transportation rates under section under section  an intrastate pipeline can provide transportation service on behalf of any interstate pipeline or local distribution company without prior ferc authorization 
specifically  the ferc adopted a so called transport or title standard requiring that for purposes of interstate transportation under section  the on behalf of entity must either have physical custody of or hold title to the gas at some point during the transaction 
section service must be provided without undue discrimination or preference and is subject to certain ferc filing and reporting requirements 
the champion and monsanto systems are regulated by the alabama public service commission apsc 
the rates for transportation to customers on these two systems are determined by negotiated contracts which are approved by the apsc 
the company s operations in texas are subject to the texas gas utility regulatory act  as implemented by the texas railroad commission the trc 
generally  the trc is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable 
the company must also make filings with the trc for all new and increased rates 
the company s intrastate systems in louisiana are subject to the regulations of the office of conservation  pipeline division of the department of natural resources commission 
as in other states  this agency possesses authority to review and authorize transactions of those entities under its jurisdiction 
this may include  but not be limited to  the construction  acquisition  abandonment  and interconnection of physical facilities and issues regarding transportation rates and contract pricing 
the company currently conducts no transportation for others through its louisiana facilities and  therefore  remains regulated only on issues governing the construction or abandonment of physical facilities and contract pricing only to the extent that no claims of unjust treatment are received by the commission 
as in the case of potential federal regulatory changes  there can be no assurances that state regulatory measures will not adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
in such events  the states regulatory authorities could temporarily suspend or hinder operations in a particular state  depending on the authority s view of its jurisdiction 
gathering operations regulation 
the nga exempts gas gathering facilities from the direct jurisdiction of the ferc 
the company believes that its gathering facilities and operations meet the current tests that the ferc uses to grant nonjurisdictional gathering facility status 
some of the recent cases applying these tests in a manner favorable to the determination of the company s nonjurisdictional status are  however  still subject to rehearing and appeal 
in addition  the ferc s articulation and application of the tests used to distinguish between jurisdictional pipelines and nonjurisdictional gathering facilities have varied over time 
while the company believes the current definitions create nonjurisdictional status for the company s gathering facilities  no assurance is available that such facilities will not  in the future  be classified as regulated transmission facilities and thus  the rates  terms  and conditions of the services rendered by those facilities would become subject to regulation by the ferc 
no state in which the company operates currently regulates gathering fees 
although the company is not aware that any state in which it operates a natural gas gathering system is likely to begin regulation of the company s natural gas gathering activities and fees  new or increased state regulation has been adopted or proposed in other natural gas producing states and there can be no assurance that such regulation will not be proposed or adopted in states where the company conducts gathering activities or that the company will not expand into or acquire operations in a state where such regulations could be imposed 
environmental and safety matters 
the company s activities in connection with the operation and construction of pipelines and other facilities for transporting  processing  treating  or storing natural gas and other products are subject to environmental and safety regulation by numerous federal  state and local authorities 
this can include ongoing oversight regulation as well as requirements for construction or other permits and clearances which must be granted in connection with new projects or expansions 
on the federal level  regulatory agencies can include the environmental protection agency epa  the occupational safety and health administration  the us army corp of engineers  the us fish and wildlife service and others 
state regulatory agencies or boards can include various air and water quality control boards  historical and cultural resources offices  fish and game services and others 
regulatory requirements can increase the cost of planning  designing  initial installation and operation of such facilities 
sanctions for violation of these requirements include a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures including assessment of monetary penalties  assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future compliance 
the following is a discussion of certain environmental and safety concerns related to the company 
it is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various federal  state and local statutes  rules  regulations  or orders to which the company s operations may be subject 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements of  including  without limitation  those state agencies mentioned above and the epa  relate to the release of substances into the environment and include measures to control water and air pollution 
moreover  the company  without regard to fault  could incur liability under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended  or state counterparts  in connection with the disposal or other releases of hazardous substances  including those arising out of historical operations conducted by the company s predecessors 
further  the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulations is toward stricter standards  and this will likely continue in the future 
environmental laws and regulations may also require the acquisition of a permit before certain activities may be conducted by the company 
further  these laws and regulations may limit or prohibit activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas  wetlands  areas providing habitat for certain species or other protected areas 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local laws covering the handling  storage or discharge of materials used by the company  or otherwise relating to protection of the environment  safety and health 
as an employer  the company is required to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury and to comply with specific safety standards 
the company will make expenditures in connection with environmental matters as part of its normal operations and capital expenditures and the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the company s compliance costs and the cost of any remediation which may become necessary 
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in the company s business due to its handling of oil  gas and petroleum products  historical industry waste disposal practices and prior use of gas flow meters containing mercury 
there can be no assurance that material environmental costs and liabilities will not be incurred by the company 
management believes  based on its current knowledge  that the company has obtained and is in current compliance with all necessary and material permits and that the company is in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental and safety regulations 
further  the company maintains insurance coverages that it believes are customary in the industry  although there can be no assurance that the company s environmental impairment insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against the company 
an uninsured or underinsured claim of sufficient magnitude could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the natural gas transmission industry 
these include damage to pipelines  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes  floods  fires and other acts of god  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leakage of natural gas and other hydrocarbons  fires and explosions  and other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life  pollution and suspension of operations 
there is no assurance that any such insurance protection will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which the company may be subject 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could materially adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable 
should catastrophic conditions occur which interrupt delivery of gas for any reason  such occurrence could have a material impact on the profitability of the company s operations 
the company is not aware of any existing environmental or safety claims that would have a material impact upon its financial position or results of operations

this total excludes inactive systems owned by the company 
oil and gas properties the company owns several non operated working interests in producing and non producing oil and gas properties 
for the year ended december   revenues from the company s oil and gas properties were less than of its total revenues  and for the same period the company s oil and gas properties represented less than of its total assets 
the company owns working interests in  gross acres of oil and gas leases and producing wells as well as other overriding royalty interests 
although it is not expected to become a major line of business for the company  management expects that acquisition and ownership of non operated oil and gas interests will remain a facet of the company s business for the foreseeable future 
title to properties the company  as part of its pipeline construction process  must obtain certain right of way agreements from landowners whose property the proposed pipeline will cross 
the terms and cost of these agreements can vary greatly due to a number of factors 
in addition  as part of its acquisition process  the company will typically evaluate the underlying right of way agreements for the particular pipeline to be acquired to determine that the pipeline owner has met all terms and conditions of the underlying right of way agreements and that the agreements are still in full force and effect 
the company typically relies upon outside service organizations to review the right of way agreements and to make suggestions to the seller as to any curative work required before closing 
the company typically does not receive a title opinion or title policy as to these right of way agreements due to the complexity of the records and expense 
occasionally  the company may seek to initiate condemnation proceedings where permitted under state law to obtain a right of way necessary for pipeline construction projects 
the company believes that this process is consistent with standards in the pipeline industry and that it holds good title to its pipeline systems  subject only to defects which the company believes are not material to the ownership of its properties or results of operations 
substantially all of the company s pipeline systems are pledged to secure borrowings under the company s credit facility

item legal proceedings 
on september   an involuntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code was filed against stewart petroleum company stewart in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of alaska the court by certain working interest owners in the west mcarthur river unit wmru production facility  which was operated by stewart 
the company receives a throughput fee for all oil and natural gas transported through the wmru pipeline  however  payment of the company s throughput fee was suspended by the court  and only those claims deemed to be necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm to the stewart estate were paid 
stewart consented to a order for relief in january and subsequently filed a disclosure statement and plan for reorganization  as amended the stewart plan 
in may  the court approved the sale to a third party of substantially all stewart s assets  including the wmru 
the sale  which was completed in june  was effective january  subsequent to the sale  the company negotiated an assumption agreement with the purchaser for the company s throughput interest  wherein the purchaser paid the company for all accrued but unpaid throughput fees subsequent to the effective date and agreed to pay the company for all future throughput fees as they become due 
an order approving the stewart plan was granted by the court on august  and pursuant to the stewart plan  the company was paid in full for all throughput fees which were accrued prior to january  on february   pan grande  of which midcoast owns a interest  filed for an arbitration hearing with the american arbitration association pursuant to the provisions of a certain contract with regard to a contractual dispute with lone star gas company lone star 
the dispute concerns the relative obligation of the parties to purchase and sell natural gas 
subsequent to the arbitration filing by pan grande  lone star withheld  from payments it owes for gas delivered by pan grande to lone star 
these funds were purportedly withheld for damages claimed by lone star as a result of the failure of pan grande to deliver natural gas to lone star on a separate occasion 
it is pan grande s belief that lone star has no legal basis to withhold the funds and therefore no allowance for bad debt has been provided for in the financial statements 
the company is currently involved in certain other litigation 
management believes that all such litigation arose in the ordinary course of business and that costs of settlements or judgements arising from such suits will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of midcoast should be read in conjunction with selected financial data contained in part i  item and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in part ii  item general since its formation  the company has grown significantly as a result of the construction and acquisition of new pipeline facilities 
since the first quarter of  the company acquired or constructed pipelines for an aggregate acquisition cost of over million 
see pipeline systems 
the company believes the historical results of operations do not fully reflect the operating efficiencies and improvements that are expected to be achieved by integrating the acquired and newly constructed pipeline systems 
as the company pursues its growth strategy in the future  its financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company s results of operations are determined primarily by the volumes of gas transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems or processed at its processing facility 
most of the company s operating costs do not vary directly with volume on existing systems  thus  increases or decreases in transportation volumes on existing systems generally have a direct effect on net income 
also  the addition of new pipeline systems typically results in a larger percentage of revenues being added to operating income as fixed overhead components are allocated over more systems 
the company derives its revenues from three primary sources i transportation fees from pipeline systems owned by the company  ii the processing and treating of natural gas and iii the marketing of natural gas 
transportation fees are received by the company for transporting gas owned by other parties through the company s pipeline systems 
typically  the company incurs very little incremental operating or administrative overhead cost to transport gas through its pipeline systems  thereby recognizing a substantial portion of incremental transportation revenues as operating income 
the company s natural gas processing revenues are realized from the extraction and sale of ngls as well as the sale of the residual natural gas 
once extracted  the ngls are further fractionated in the company s facilities into products such as ethane  propane  butanes  natural gasoline and condensate  then sold to various wholesalers along with raw sulfur from the company s sulfur recovery plant 
typically  the company enters into agreements with natural gas producers wherein the company and the producer share in the revenue generated from the sale of ngls extracted at the company s facilities 
the company s processing operations can be adversely affected by declines in ngl prices  declines in gas throughput or increases in shrinkage or fuel costs 
the company entered the processing business in october with its purchase of the harmony system 
the company s gas marketing revenues are realized through the purchase and resale of natural gas to the company s customers 
generally  gas marketing activities will generate higher revenues and correspondingly higher expenses than revenues and expenses associated with transportation activities  given the same volumes of gas 
this relationship exists because  unlike revenues derived from transportation activities  gas marketing revenues and associated expenses include the full commodity price of the natural gas acquired 
the operating income the company recognizes from its gas marketing efforts is the difference between the price at which the gas was purchased and the price at which it was resold to the company s customers 
the company s strategy is to focus its marketing activities on company owned pipelines 
the company s marketing activities have historically varied greatly in response to market fluctuations 
the company has had quarter to quarter fluctuations in its financial results in the past due to the fact that the company s natural gas sales and pipeline throughputs can be affected by changes in demand for natural gas primarily because of the weather 
although  historically  quarter to quarter fluctuations resulting from weather variations have not been significant  the acquisitions of the magnolia system  the mit system and the midla systems have increased the impact that weather conditions have on the company s financial results 
in particular  demand on the magnolia system  mit system and midla systems fluctuate due to weather variations because of the large municipal and other seasonal customers which are served by the respective systems 
as a result  historically the winter months have generated more income than summer months on these systems 
there can be no assurances that the company s efforts to minimize such effects will have any impact on future quarter to quarter fluctuations due to changes in demand resulting from variations in weather conditions 
furthermore  future results could differ materially from historical results due to a number of factors including but not limited to interruption or cancellation of existing contracts  the impact of competitive products and services  pricing of and demand for such products and services and the presence of competitors with greater financial resources 
the company has also from time to time derived significant income by capitalizing on opportunities in the industry to sell its pipeline systems on favorable terms as the company receives offers for such systems which are suited to another company s pipeline network 
although no substantial divestitures are currently under consideration  the company will from time to time solicit bids for selected properties which are no longer suited to its business strategy 
results of operations as indicated in note pipeline construction and acquisition  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  midcoast has acquired or constructed numerous pipelines in the three year period ended december  these assets were acquired from numerous sellers  at different periods throughout the year and all were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and accordingly  the results of operations for such pipelines are included in the company s financial statements only from the applicable date of the acquisition 
as a consequence  the historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable 
the following tables present certain data for major operating units of midcoast for the three years ended december  a discussion follows which explains significant factors that have affected midcoast s operating results during these periods 
gross margin for each of the units is defined as the revenues of the unit less related direct costs and expenses of the unit 
as previously discussed  the company provides natural gas marketing services to its customers 
for analysis purposes  the company accounts for the marketing services by recording the marketing activity on the operating unit where it occurs 
therefore  the gross margin for each of the major operating units include a transportation and marketing component 
transmission pipelines for the year ended december  in thousands  except gross margin per mmbtu operating revenues transportation fees  marketing    total operating revenues    operating expenses cost of natural gas and transportation charges    operating expenses  total operating expenses    gross margin  volume in mmbtu transportation    marketing    total volume    gross margin per mmbtu 


the company s entrance into the regulated interstate pipeline business with the acquisition of the mit system and the mlgc system significantly enhanced the gross margin generated from the transmission pipelines operating unit in the company s capacity on its transmission pipelines increased from  mmbtu day to  mmbtu day in and capacity utilization rates increased from in to in as a result of the increased capacity utilization rates and additional transmission pipeline customers utilizing the marketing services of the company  the gross margin generated by the transmission pipeline unit increased from  in to  in in addition  gross margin per mmbtu increased from 
to 
in due to the higher transportation rates received on the mit system and the mlgc system  as well as  negotiating higher transportation rates from customers on the magnolia system 
the company has succeeded in increasing contracted transportation volumes on both the mit system and the mlgc system since completing the acquisitions 
through the completion of two successful open seasons  contracted demand on the mit system has increased by for the winter of which includes new long term transportation agreements with the cities of huntsville and decatur  alabama 
construction of new pipeline facilities on the mit system is planned to accommodate the incremental volumes generated by the new transportation contracts and is awaiting ferc approval 
contracted demand on the mlgc system has increased due to the execution of a new mmcf day gas transportation contract to service a new cogeneration facility near baton rouge 
transportation services under the new contract will commence upon the completion of related construction of new facilities expected in the fourth quarter of end user pipelines for the year ended december  in thousands  except gross margin per mmbtu operating revenues end user transportation fees   marketing    total operating revenues    operating expenses cost of natural gas and transportation charges 
   operating expenses total operating expenses    gross margin   volume in mmbtu transportation    marketing    total volume    gross margin per mmbtu 


the company s gross margin for the end user pipelines operating unit increased from  in to  in the results of operations of the trigas subsidiary acquired in the mit acquisition accounted for of the increase 
in addition  included a full year of operations for several end user pipeline acquisitions made during capacity on the company s end user pipelines increased through acquisitions to  mmbtu day but only experienced a utilization rate of in the excess capacity would allow midcoast to service any incremental needs of its end user customers with little or no additional costs 
since midcoast s ownership of mlgt  new contracts have been executed to provide mmcf day of new marketing services beginning january  to an industrial facility near port hudson  louisiana  and an additional mmcf day of natural gas marketing services to a new cogeneration facility near baton rouge by the end of the company is currently constructing a new high pressure end user pipeline system to service the new contracts 
the new pipeline will allow the company to compete for potential new customers along the industrial corridor of the mississippi river requiring natural gas at pressures previously not available through the midla systems 
gathering pipelines and natural gas processing for the year ended december  in thousands  except gross margin per mmbtu operating revenues gathering transportation fees processing revenue   marketing   total operating revenues   operating expenses processing costs   cost of natural gas and transportation charges 
  operating expenses total operating expenses   gross margin   volume in mmbtu gathering    processing  marketing  total volume    gross margin per mmbtu 


the gathering pipelines and natural gas processing operating unit reflected mixed results in as compared to the gross margin for the operating unit as a whole increased to  in from  in gathering transportation fees decreased by  due principally to throughput declines on the company s pipeline investment in alaska 
this decrease was more than offset by increased margins created from marketing transactions on gathering pipelines acquired in the fourth quarter of the volumes and gross margin related to the company s processing plant increased in as a result of having a full year of operations 
however  the processing margins on a per unit basis were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices in as compared to the company s share of proceeds from the sale of ngls and the residue natural gas declines as the price of the commodity declines 
however  a  expansion of the harmony plant s gathering pipeline in the fourth quarter of connected four new wells and increased ngl sales and residue gas sales by approximately and  respectively 
the future profitability of the harmony plant will be affected by changes in commodity pricing of ngls and natural gas  production curtailments  shut in wells and also the natural declines in the deliverability of the reservoirs connected and dedicated to midcoast s processing plant 
other income  costs and expenses in  the company received revenues of  from its oil and gas properties as compared to  over the same period in the increase is primarily associated with a successful drilling program in the company s sun field properties 
in addition  certain of midcoast s oil and gas properties have been approved for changes in well spacing and tertiary recovery by depressurization 
the company believes these factors may contribute to increased volumes and revenues for its oil and gas properties 
in  the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization increased when compared to primarily due to increased depreciation on assets acquired in the mit and midla acquisitions 
collectively  these new acquisitions accounted for of the increase of  in  the company s general and administrative expenses increased when compared to primarily due to increased costs associated with the management of the assets acquired in the mit and midla acquisitions 
collectively  these new acquisitions accounted for of the increase of  in addition  the increase can be attributed to the company s expansion of its infrastructure to allow for continued growth 
in  the company s interest expense increased when compared to the year ended  from  to  the increase is associated with additional borrowings of approximately million  which were outstanding for one month and used to bridge finance the mit acquisition and the addition of approximately million in debt  that was outstanding for november and december and used to finance the midla acquisition 
the company recognized annual operating income and net income in of million and million  respectively  as compared to million in operating income and million in net income for the year ended basic earnings per share eps increased from in to in the company achieved the increased eps despite the dilutive effects of issuing additional shares in the august and july common stock offerings 
the significant improvement in eps is primarily attributable to the positive impact of accretive acquisitions consummated during income taxes as of december   the company had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million  subject to revision based on republics final tax returns  expiring in various amounts from through these nols were generated by the company s predecessor and republic 
the ability of the company to utilize the carryforwards is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income and will be affected by annual limitations currently estimated at approximately million on the use of such carryforwards due to a change in shareholder control under the internal revenue code triggered by the company s july common stock offering and the change of ownership created by the acquisition of republic 
the company believes  however  that the limitation will not materially impact the company s ability to utilize the nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
depending on profitability  the limitation could result in the company s income tax expense to increase as compared to previous years where no such limitation existed 
capital resources and liquidity the company had historically funded its capital requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings from affiliates and various commercial lenders 
however  the capital resources of the company were significantly improved with the equity infusion derived from its initial and secondary common stock offerings in august and july  respectively 
the net proceeds of the company s combined stock offerings contributed approximately million and significantly improved the company s financial flexibility 
this increased flexibility has allowed the company to pursue acquisition and expansion opportunities utilizing lower cost conventional bank debt financing 
the proceeds from the secondary offering were used to reduce outstanding bank debt and effectively lowered the company s long term debt to total capitalization ratio to at december  based on a re evaluation of the cash flows generated from the mit acquisition and other midcoast assets  and the completion of the company s midla acquisition  the company has increased its borrowing availability under its bank financing agreements with bank one texas  na bank one 
on october   amendments to the credit agreements were entered into which increased the company s borrowing availability from million to million  eliminated principal reduction requirements  lowered the interest rate on borrowings  and extended the maturity of the facility one year to august  bank one has committed to lending  in the aggregate  up to million of the million in borrowing availability 
if required  the additional million may be accessed with the inclusion of another bank lender in a bank syndication 
the amended credit agreements provide borrowing availability as follows i a million lc line of credit facility  of which million can be used for working capital needs and million is available for issuance of letters of credit  ii a million revolver which expires in august and iii a million mit revolver expiring august collectively the credit agreements 
when borrowings under the amended credit agreements are less than of the million borrowing base  at the company s option  interest will accrue at libor plus or the bank one base rate 
when borrowings are greater than of available credit  an additional 
will be added to the above rates 
these rates reflect a reduction in the libor option and a 
reduction in the bank one base rate option effective september  in addition  the company is subject to a non recurring facility fee as funds are borrowed  as well as a 
commitment fee payable quarterly on the unused portion of borrowing availability 
the credit agreement is secured by all accounts receivable  contracts  the pledge of the stock of mit  mlgc and magnolia pipeline corporation and a first lien security interest in the company s pipeline systems 
the borrowing availability under each line is subject to revision  on a monthly basis for the lc line of credit facility and a semi annual basis for the revolver s  based on the performance of the company s existing assets and any asset dispositions or additions from new construction or acquisitions 
the credit agreements contains a number of customary covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  and limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  transfer or sell assets  create liens  or enter into a merger or consolidation 
midcoast was in compliance with such financial covenants  as amended  at december  the only outstanding long term indebtedness other than the indebtedness under the credit agreements  are the notes payable to banks associated with the acquisition of a gas gathering pipeline by starr county the starr county note and the acquisition of six pipelines by pan grande the pan grande note 
the pan grande note was entered into by pan grande in march to finance the acquisition of the guadalupe  chapa  guerra and loma novia pipeline systems 
the pan grande note is secured by each respective system and all associated transportation revenues with guarantees by each member of pan grande proportionate to their ownership interest 
the pan grande note bears interest at the prime rate plus at december  
upon maturity  accelerated to may due to prepayments on the note  the balance of principal plus accrued interest then outstanding is payable in full 
the starr county note was entered into by starr county in january to finance the acquisition of the flores gathering system 
the starr county note is secured by the flores system and all transportation revenues pertaining to the system  with guarantees by each partner of starr county  proportionate to their ownership interest 
accordingly  the company has guaranteed of the loan value 
the starr county note bears interest at the prime rate plus at december  
upon maturity  accelerated to august due to prepayments on the note  the balance of principal plus accrued interest then remaining outstanding is payable in full 
for the year ended december   the company generated cash flow from operating activities of approximately million before changes in working capital accounts and had approximately million available to the company under its credit agreements 
at december   the company had committed to making approximately million in capital expenditures in see construction 
the company believes that its existing credit agreement and funds provided by operations will be sufficient for it to meet its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future  and its projected capital expenditures of approximately million 
if funds under the credit agreement are not available to fund acquisition and construction projects the company would seek to obtain such financing for the sale of equity securities or other debt financing 
there can be no assurances that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
should sufficient capital not be available  the company will not be able to implement its acquisition strategy 
risk management according to guidelines provided by the board  the company enters into exchange traded commodity futures  options and swap contracts to reduce the exposure to market fluctuations in price and transportation costs of energy commodities and is not to engage in speculative trading 
approvals are required from senior management prior to the execution of any financial derivative 
the financial derivatives have pricing terms indexed to both the new york mercantile exchange and the kansas city board of trade 
the company s market exposures arise from inventory balances and fixed price purchase and sale commitments 
the company uses the exchange traded commodities to manage and hedge price risk related to these market exposures 
gas futures involve the buying and selling of natural gas at a fixed price 
over the counter swap agreements require the company to receive or make payments based on the difference between a specified price and the actual price of natural gas 
the company uses futures and swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed price purchase or sales commitments for physical quantities of natural gas 
options held to hedge risk provide the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price 
the company utilizes options to manage margins and to limit overall price risk exposure
