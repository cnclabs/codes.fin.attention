the growth rate in canada in terms of canadian dollars was steady throughout the year  but the decline in the value of the canadian dollar hampered the growth rate in terms of us dollars  particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
us sales growth was lower in the first half of the year and for the first and second quarters  respectively despite double digit rates of growth in moca tm and var sales 
this was partially related to declines in retail sales  which reflected the company s decision to substantially reduce its retail sales activities in early  in part to address liquidity issues and constraints 
the company recommitted significant resources to rebuilding its retail customer base in early  which contributed to fourth quarter growth in retail sales of on a year over year basis

the decrease in adjusted gross profit is attributed primarily to competitive pricing pressures and the impact of liquidity constraints on the company s ability to purchase on favorable terms 
the company is addressing the margin issue by targeting specific areas for margin improvement including sales execution  product mix  pricing and customer mix 
however  the company continues to face intense competitive pricing pressures  and the company s efforts to improve its margins may not be successful

these factors were offset in part by an increase in interest rates under the operating company debt during prior to its elimination in september of other expense for the company  including former operations  decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to one time financing charges paid in the first quarter of of approximately  related to amendments of financing agreements which have since been terminated

the canadian sales increase is in line with the growth in the industry for the markets in which that subsidiary competes

consolidated loss the company  including former operations  reported an increase in net loss from  in to  in the net loss per share increased from in to in systems and processes  year issues merisel has made significant investments in new  advanced computer and warehouse management systems for its north american operations to support sales growth and improve service levels 
all of merisel s nine north american warehouses now utilize merisel s information and logistical efficiency system miles  a computerized warehouse management system  which uses infrared bar coding and advanced computer hardware and software to maintain high picking  receiving and shipping accuracy rates 
merisel is in the process of converting its us operations to the sap client server operating system 
the company plans to convert its us operations to the sap system no later than the first part of the company converted its canadian operations from a mainframe to the client server operating system in august sap is an enterprise wide system which integrates all functional areas of the business including order entry  inventory management and finance in a real time environment 
the new system is designed to provide greater transaction functionality  automated controls  flexibility  and custom pricing applications 
the company believes that implementation of the sap operating system will address its major year issues  which arise in cases where computer systems or any equipment with computer chips use two digit fields that recognize dates using the assumption that the first two digits are 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism including date sensitive software that uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including among other things a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
the company is currently engaged in a review of its computer systems and applications  including packaged software used by the company  not addressed by the sap operating system 
the company expects to make any modifications required to resolve year issues in a timely manner and to have the majority completed by early leaving adequate time to assess and correct any significant issues that may materialize 
the company is seeking assurances of year compliance from its suppliers of software and other products and services used internally that might raise year issues 
the company is also expecting to initiate formal communications with selected vendors and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company can give no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted on time or that failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is taking steps to reduce the likelihood that such failures could affect the company s systems through any electronic communications 
the company does not expect that the review and modifications described above excluding the cost of implementing the sap operating system in the us will require material expenditures 
if the company is unable to successfully implement the sap operating system sufficiently in advance of the year  however  additional expenditures could be required and such expenditures could be substantial 
see liquidity and capital expenditures below 
the design and implementation of these new systems are complex projects and involve certain risks 
until such implementation  the company will continue to modify its existing us systems and may experience difficulty in processing transactions  which could adversely affect operating income and cash flows 
in addition  if the modifications required to address the company s year issues are not made  or are not timely  the year issues could have a material impact on the operations and financial results and condition of the company 
variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the company has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the computer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates of existing products  and iii the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the dynamic characteristics of the computer product distribution industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
additionally  in the us and canada  the company s net sales in the fourth quarter have been historically higher than in its other three quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher fourth quarter sales is partially explained by customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business and holiday purchases 
as a result of this pattern  the company s working capital requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater than other quarters 
net sales in the canadian operations are also historically strong in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
this is primarily due to buying patterns of canadian government agencies 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
liquidity and capital resources general discussion of liquidity over the periods presented from the time the company was founded in through the end of  it experienced accelerated growth that was fueled by a combination of industry growth  industry consolidation and acquisitions 
by the end of the first quarter of  the company s internal growth and acquisitions had created a complex organization with operations in more than eleven countries 
the rapid growth put a tremendous burden on the company s management to effectively integrate the diverse operations and implement several new initiatives including new warehouse systems  a centralized european distribution center  and an integrated north american operating system 
at the same time  the industry continued to evolve resulting in increasing competitive pressures on gross margins 
to fund the new initiatives  working capital growth and acquisitions  the company incurred significant debt which  combined with the decreasing gross margins and increases in interest rates  resulted in declining profitability and increased debt service requirements 
despite declining earnings and increasing debt burden  the company had sufficient cash reserves and available borrowing capacity to meet its debt obligations and to fund continued growth during and throughout  and considered the investments in new initiatives to be a vital component of long term growth and profitability 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded  in negative adjustments to its operating earnings 
these adjustments included i a charge to trade accounts payable for  to address vendor reconciliation issues  ii impairment losses of  on intangible assets associated with the company s computerland franchise business  iii impairment losses of  related to cost overruns on the implementation of system installations  and iv other adjustments to asset and liability values 
as a result  the company incurred substantial losses during the fourth quarter of  and was required to negotiate with lenders under various financing agreements to amend such agreements and waive certain defaults 
in order to comply with the requirements of its lenders  merisel developed a plan in april that sought to maximize cash flow by controlling costs and curtailing non essential capital expenditure investments during the remainder of however  while these amended agreements were considered by the company to be sufficient to allow it to operate without the need for additional sources of financing in  because a substantial amount of the operating company debt was due in mid  the company anticipated that it would need to dispose of certain assets  and or obtain new financing arrangements  in order to position itself to meet this obligation 
accordingly  the company began actively exploring all of its strategic options with the assistance of merrill lynch co 
in early  which included the sale of certain of its operating subsidiaries 
this effort led to the sale of eml in october from the proceeds of this sale  the company repaid  principal amount of the operating company debt and negotiated an extension of the due date on the remaining principal outstanding to january  however  this extension also stipulated that if the company made its june  interest payment on the notes  then the company would have to make an aggregate principal repayment of  on the operating company debt 
further  if the company were to have made the december  interest payment on the notes  then the company would have been required to make an additional principal repayment of  the company did not believe that it would be able to make the principal repayments on such debt  as described above  and therefore began actively pursuing a restructuring plan with the debtholders under its various financing agreements 
additionally  beginning in the fourth quarter of  merisel aggressively pursued a strategy of proactively working with vendors and other creditors to negotiate more flexible trading terms and thereby improve cash flow 
on september   the company issued the initial shares and the convertible note to phoenix and used the proceeds therefrom to repay substantially all of the outstanding operating company debt 
on december   the entire outstanding convertible note was converted into common stock  which improves the company s liquidity position by substantially decreasing the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness and  consequently  interest expense 
cash flows activity for the year ended december  net cash used by operating activities during the year ended december  was  the primary uses of cash were an increase in accounts receivable of  and an increase in inventory of  the primary sources of cash were an increase in accounts payable of  and  of cash generated from operations 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily the result of increased sales of in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventory relates partially to investments required to meet the demands of increased sales volume and to strategic volume purchases that the company took advantage of late in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventories also contributed to the increase in accounts payable

net cash provided by financing in was  sources of cash from financing activities included  in proceeds received from the sale of receivables under the company s asset securitization facilities and  in net proceeds from the issuance of initial shares and the convertible note which consists of  in gross proceeds less  in investment banking  legal  accounting and other direct costs 
uses of cash for financing activities include scheduled debt payments of  and the extinguishment of operating company debt of  as noted above  a portion of the company s funds are also generated through the sale of receivables by merisel capital funding  inc merisel capital funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of merisel americas
