item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company the company s operating results are affected by company specific factors  primarily its refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds  seasonal factors  such as the demand for petroleum products and working capital requirements in the northeast  both of which vary significantly during the year  and industry factors  such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices  the demand for and prices of refined products and industry supply capacity 
the effect of crude oil price changes on the company s operating results is determined  in part  by the rate at which refined product prices adjust to reflect such changes 
as a result  the company s earnings have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
seasonality in the northeast  demand for petroleum products varies significantly during the year 
distillate demand during the first and fourth quarters can range from to above the average demand during the second and third quarters 
the substantial increase in demand for heating oil during the winter months results in the company s northeast operations having significantly higher accounts receivable and inventory levels during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
additionally  the company is impacted by the increased demand for gasoline during the summer vacation season 
the company s southwest operations are less affected by seasonal fluctuations in demand than its operations in the northeast

a summary net income for the year ended december   totaled million as compared to a net loss in of million 
in the southwest  the company had operating income of million in  as compared to million for the increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased refining margins at the mid continent refineries  increased throughput at the wilmington refinery  increased retail fuel volumes  and decreased operating expenses due primarily to efficiencies gained from the merger 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in the average retail marketing fuel margin and a decrease in the retail marketing merchandise margin 
in the northeast  operating income was million for as compared to million for  as a result of improved retail marketing fuel volumes and a increase in the retail marketing margin 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the quebec refinery throughput and a decline in the refining margin 
southwest operations sales and other revenues in the southwest for the year ended december  totaled billion and were higher than primarily due to an increase in retail marketing fuel volumes and the additional sales of million from total  acquired in september the refining margin for the mid continent refineries of per barrel for increased by as compared to per barrel for  reflecting declining crude oil costs and increased demand during as a result of a partial shutdown of the mckee refinery in the fourth quarter of  throughput  excluding the total refineries  declined by from to  however  this shutdown of mckee allowed the total refineries to operate at much higher levels to supply the needed demand 
during the shutdown at the mckee refinery  the company performed additional maintenance in order to defer a scheduled turnaround until the refining margin for the wilmington refinery remained steady at per barrel in as compared to in throughput at the wilmington refinery during increased by over the same period in to  bpd  principally due to the processing of additional feedstocks through the refinery s gas oil hydrotreater which came on stream in the second quarter of retail marketing fuel volume increased by to  bpd  principally as a result of the addition of new convenience stores during and increased volumes sold through total branded convenience stores acquired in september retail fuel margins decreased by to cents per gallon for  due primarily to a very competitive pricing environment at the station level in the texas market  partially offset by increased fuel margins in california and colorado in merchandise sales at the company s convenience stores increased to million per day during from million per day in this increase is a direct result of the company s plan to expand and upgrade its marketing operations  which included the construction of new stores and the acquisition of total convenience stores 
on a per store basis  merchandise sales increased due to the company closing or selling approximately underperforming convenience stores 
the retail marketing merchandise margin remained steady at in as compared to in  as competitive pressures on the pricing of beer  soda and tobacco products continued 
the petrochemicals and ngl s businesses contributed million to operating income versus million in as a result of increased sales of polymer grade propylene from the second splitter completed in  and continued strong demand for nitromite fertilizer 
in the fourth quarter of  the company started an expansion project for the existing two propane propylene splitters  and will complete construction of a third splitter in to take advantage of the increasing demand for polymer grade propylene  used in the manufacture of plastics

selling  general and administrative expenses for of million were million higher than in  and included million of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by total for the three months ended december  overall  selling  general and administrative expense remained level with reflecting higher selling costs incurred to support the increased sales which were offset by lower general and administrative expenses associated with synergies resulting from the merger 
northeast operations sales and other revenues in the northeast in totaled billion and were million  or  lower than  as a result of lower throughput and lower product prices during the year 
refining margins decreased by to per barrel in as compared to per barrel in  due to lower average atlantic basin crack spreads 
throughput at the quebec refinery averaged  bpd or lower than in as throughput was adversely affected by a scheduled major turnaround in the second quarter of during the recent ice storms in the northeast  the quebec refinery  which is located north of the affected area  continued to operate  while competitors refineries were shut down due to power failures  thus allowing for improved margins in early overall retail margins increased cents per gallon to cents per gallon in as compared to  reflecting more stable market conditions as a result of the company s value plus pricing program initiated in the second half of  and the home heat and cardlock segments ability to maintain prices as crude oil prices declined 
retail marketing volumes increased in as compared to  to  bpd  as a result of acquiring three home heating oil businesses in  and converting agent operated stores to company owned convenience stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses for of million were million lower than in  principally due to the previously mentioned cost reductions and synergies from the merger 
corporate expenses despite significantly lower average working capital borrowings  net interest expense of million in was million higher than in due primarily to the assumption of approximately million of debt at the time of the total acquisition and a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized on property  plant and equipment additions 
the consolidated income tax provisions for totaled million  representing an effective tax rate of as compared to the effective income tax benefit of million or 
the effective tax rate was low due to non deductible merger and other costs recorded in the consolidated effective income tax rates exceed the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and the effects of foreign operations

the refining margin at the mckee and three rivers refineries increased by to per barrel in  reflecting crude oil price volatility during the year 
refining margin at the wilmington refinery increased by to per barrel in due to an improvement in the heavy sour crude oil price differential 
refinery throughput at the mckee and three rivers refineries during increased by to  bpd as several upgrade and expansion projects were completed during the year 
throughput at the wilmington refinery in increased by to  bpd  principally due to the operation of the refinery s new gas oil hydrotreater 
in addition  refinery throughput at the wilmington refinery in was adversely affected as refinery units were down on several occasions to tie in units required to make carb specification gasoline and to replace the crude oil heater destroyed by a explosion and fire 
retail marketing fuel volume increased by to  bpd  principally as a result of the december ncs acquisition  which included stop n go convenience stores  however  not all stop n go stores sold gasoline 
the retail marketing fuel margin decreased by to cents per gallon in  due to intense competitive pressures in the california and texas markets 
merchandise sales at the company s convenience stores more than doubled from million per day in to million per day in as a result of the ncs acquisition

cost of products sold  as a percentage of sales  increased by compared to refining margin increased to per barrel in  from per barrel in  as a result of higher average atlantic basin crack spreads and the ability to process low cost heidrun crude oil for all of as compared to only one month in throughput at the quebec refinery averaged  bpd in  or higher than in  as throughput was adversely affected by refinery downtime while work was performed to configure the refinery to run lower cost acidic crude oils such as heidrun 
retail fuel margin decreased by cents per gallon  or  to cents per gallon from to  reflecting continued competitive pressures on motorist margins and the impact of higher distillate wholesale prices on both heating oil and cardlock sales through the first ten months of retail marketing fuel volume for increased from  to  bpd  as a result of the company expanding home heating oil operations and the implementation of the value plus program in the canadian retail gasoline operations late in the second quarter of refining operating expenses  before depreciation  totaled million  or per barrel in  compared to million  or per barrel in refinery operating expenses in reflect increased throughput as well as the incremental additive and chemical costs associated with running heidrun crude oil 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million during were million higher than in  principally due to the previously mentioned acquisition of home heating oil and distribution operations in the northeast united states during and the one time cost related to the rollout of the value plus program 
corporate expenses net interest expense totaled million for  an increase of million or over the level  as average borrowings increased from billion in to billion in as a result of additional borrowings used to finance the ncs acquisition in december the average interest rate on the company s borrowings was for as compared to for as a result of recognizing million in merger and integration costs  the company incurred a net loss for  however  certain of the merger costs were non deductible for income tax purposes  thus the effective income tax benefit rate for was 
this compares to an effective tax rate of in outlook the company s earnings depend largely on refining and retail marketing margins 
the petroleum refining and marketing industry has been and continues to be volatile and highly competitive 
the cost of crude oil purchased by the company as well as the price of refined products sold by the company have fluctuated significantly in the past 
as a result of the historic volatility of refining and marketing margins and the fact that they are affected by numerous diverse factors  it is impossible to predict future margin levels 
during the latter part of the fourth quarter of and continuing into  crude oil prices have declined significantly from the same period a year ago 
the decline in crude oil prices is the result of saudi arabia indicating in november that it would increase production  the milder winter weather brought about by the phenomenon known as el nino  and the likelihood that economic turmoil in southeast asia will trim demand 
continued unrest in the middle east has added a great deal of uncertainty to what will happen to crude oil prices for the rest of the first quarter and throughout the balance of should any military action occur  the impact on production and deliveries of middle east crude oil will more than likely spike crude oil prices industry wide 
in general  low distillate demand has put downward pressure on product prices  which has not been entirely offset by the lower crude oil prices  thus squeezing refinery margins 
should crude oil prices remain at levels materially lower than december  prices  the company will be required to reduce the carrying value of its crude oil inventories 
west coast refining margins have remained stronger than most of the other regions of the country as the first quarter of begins  and the retail margins continue to be strong  however  retail volumes have been affected in some areas due to heavy california rains 
mid continent refining margins have declined as we enter the first quarter of and retail margins have remained steady with levels of the fourth quarter of merchandise margins for the first quarter of are expected to remain constant with levels obtained in the fourth quarter of in eastern canada  refining margins have declined in the first quarter of  while retail margins continued to be strong 
the quebec refinery  which is located north of the area affected by the recent ice storms  was able to operate while other refineries were forced to shut down 
demand for heating oil has strengthened  helping maintain retail heating oil prices  however  not at normal winter volume levels

exchange rates the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has weakened substantially since the acquisition of the canadian operations in subsequent to december   the canadian dollar set an historical low against the us dollar 
as the company s canadian operations are in a net asset position  the weaker canadian dollar has reduced  in us dollars  the company s net equity as of december   by million 
although the company expects the exchange rate to fluctuate during  it cannot reasonably predict its future movement 
with the exception of its crude oil costs  which are us dollar denominated  fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate will affect the us dollar amount of revenues and related costs and expenses reported by the canadian operation 
the potential impact on refining margin of fluctuating exchange rates together with us dollar denominated crude oil costs is mitigated by the company s pricing policies in the northeast  which generally pass on any change in the cost of crude oil 
marketing margins  on the other hand  have been adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations as competitive pressures have  from time to time  limited the company s ability to promptly pass on the increased costs to the ultimate consumer 
the company has considered various strategies to manage currency risk  and it hedges the canadian currency risk when such hedging is considered economically appropriate 
impact of year issue the year issue is the result of using two digits rather than four digits to define a year within older computer software and hardware configurations 
older programs and equipment  which are date sensitive  may recognize a as the year instead of the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities

beyond the it systems  the company is in the process of reviewing all other critical operating functions and significant suppliers vendors to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to year situations 
based on a preliminary assessment  the company believes that it will be able to make all necessary conversions to be year compliant by december   and the impact of such compliance is not expected to have a material effect on financial position or the results of operations 
impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in the us and canadian economies  increasing the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and increasing the costs of supplies and labor 
as previously noted  to the extent permitted by competition  the company passes along increased costs to its customers 
in addition  the company is affected by volatility in the cost of crude oils and refined petroleum products as market conditions continue to be the primary factor in determining the costs of the company s products 
the company uses the lifo method of accounting for its inventories 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs
