increases in net sales typically result in operating profit improvements that exceed the net sales increases on a percentage basis due to the allocation of fixed and semi fixed costs and expenses over a higher sales base 
corporate development acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to masco s long term growth  even though generally the initial impact on earnings is minimal after deducting acquisition related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization 
the important earnings benefit to masco arises from subsequent growth of acquired companies  since incremental sales are not handicapped by these expenses 
during  the company acquired texwood industries  inc  a us manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinetry  and five other home improvement and building products companies  including two companies in europe 
the results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition

the convertible preferred stock represents transferable rights for up to a percent common ownership  although the company is restricted from maintaining an ownership in excess of percent of furnishings international s common equity 
as such  the company will not acquire additional common equity  except for purposes of resale only

the million balance of the consideration was paid by mascotech to the company on september   as provided for in the sale agreement  mascotech at that date delivered to the company million shares approximately percent of the outstanding common stock of emco limited and million in cash 
mascotech recognized a million after tax gain from the delivery to the company of the emco limited common stock 
the company s recording of equity earnings from mascotech for excludes the effect of such gain due to the related party nature of the transaction 
emco limited is a leading canadian distributor and manufacturer of home improvement and building products 
mascotech holds an option  expiring in  to require the company to purchase up to million aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities of mascotech 
for the acquisitions of texwood industries and five other companies  the combined purchase price was approximately million  including the assumption of debt and issuance of a short term note aggregating million  million shares of company common stock valued at approximately million and million of cash paid

excluding amortization of acquired goodwill million  million  and million in  and  respectively  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were percent in compared with percent and percent for and  respectively 
the downward trend in the selling  general and administrative expenses percentage results from the company s continuation of cost containment initiatives  the substitution of contingent incentive based compensation for the reduction in fixed compensation for certain executives and the leverage of fixed and semi fixed costs over a higher sales base
