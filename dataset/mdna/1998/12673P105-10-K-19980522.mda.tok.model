adjusted to reflect three for two stock split effective june  and november  the company has traditionally reported lower profit margins in the first two quarters of each fiscal year than those experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
as part of the annual budget process  management establishes higher discretionary expense levels in relation to projected revenue for the first half of the year 
historically  the companys combined third and fourth quarter revenue have been greater than the first half of the year  as these two quarters coincide with clients calendar year budget periods and culmination of the companys annual sales plan 
these historically higher second half revenue have resulted in significantly higher profit margins since total expenses have not increased in proportion to revenue 
however  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance 
the companys products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of its clients information processing resources 
accordingly  in a recessionary environment  the companys products are often a reasonable economic alternative to customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general or regional slowdown in the world economy could adversely affect the companys operations 
the companys future operating results may be affected by a number of other factors  including  but not limited to uncertainties relative to global economic conditions  the adequacy of the companys internal administrative systems to efficiently process transactions  store and retrieve data subsequent to the year  the companys increasing reliance on a single family of products for a material portion of its sales  market acceptance of competing technologies  the availability and cost of new solutions  delays in delivery of new products or features  the companys ability to update its business application products to conform with the new  common european currency known as the euro  the companys ability to successfully maintain or increase market share in its core business while expanding its product base into other markets  the strength of its distribution channels  the ability either internally or through third party service providers to support client implementation of the companys products  the companys ability to manage fixed and variable expense growth relative to revenue growth  and the companys ability to effectively integrate acquired products and operations 
the company may experience further uncertainties and unanticipated costs regarding year compliance of its products 
the company has designed the current version of the vast majority of its product offerings to be year compliant 
however  there is currently a small minority of its product offerings that have not been updated to year compliance specifications 
the company is making its best efforts to address this issue and will continue to update and test its products for year compliance 
the company has publicly identified any products that will not be updated to be year compliant and has been encouraging clients using these products to migrate to compliant versions or products 
there can be no assurance that all the companys products will be year compliant prior to january  nor can there be assurances that the companys currently compliant products do not contain undetected problems associated with year compliance 
such problems may negatively affect future operating results 
the company recognizes the significance of the year problem as it relates to its internal systems 
it has an overall plan and a systematic process in place to make its internal financial and administrative systems year ready within the next to months 
the cost of this exercise is not viewed to have a material effect on the companys results of operations or liquidity
