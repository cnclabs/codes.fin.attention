all domestic properties have been sold or otherwise disposed 
the only oil and gas interest of the company at this time is as a result of the company s investment in kkm through cap g 
kkm is a closed joint stock company in kazakhstan 
the company has raised capital to finance a portion of its obligations in connection with the acquisition of its interest in cap g and the development of the karakuduk field and to satisfy working capital needs in the short term 
since january   the company raised  through the sale of common stock   through the exercises of warrants and  through the sale of series a preferred stock 
the company may seek to obtain additional capital through debt or equity offerings  encumbering properties  entering into arrangements whereby certain costs of development will be paid by others to earn an interest in the properties  or sale of a portion of the company s interest in the karakuduk field 
the present environment for financing the acquisition of oil and gas properties or the ongoing obligations of the oil and gas business is uncertain due  in part  to instability in oil and gas pricing in recent years 
the company s small size and the early stage of development of the karakuduk field may also increase the difficulty in raising any financing that may be needed in the future 
there can be no assurance that the debt or equity financing that might be required to fund the company s operations and obligations in the future will be available to the company on economically acceptable terms if at all

since the karakuduk field is in the early stage of development  the karakuduk field does not currently produce revenues sufficient to meet its cash outflow needs 
the development of the karakuduk field  through kkm  will require substantial amounts of additional capital 
the terms of the kkm revised license require a work plan from the commencement of operations through december   of at least  which has been satisfied 
additional requirements of million and million exist for the years ending december  and  respectively
