item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company s revenues are generated by the sale of disk sputtering systems and related disk manufacturing equipment  system components  contract research and development activities  flat panel display manufacturing equipment and electron beam processing equipment 
disk sputtering systems and related disk manufacturing equipment generally represent the majority of the company s revenue and intevac is a leading supplier of this equipment 
sputtering is a complex vacuum deposition process used to deposit multiple thin film layers on a disk 
intevac s system component business consists primarily of sales of spare parts and after sale service to purchasers of the company s disk sputtering systems  as well as sales of components to other manufacturers of vacuum equipment 
contract research and development revenues have been derived primarily from prime contracts awarded by and subcontracts awarded under various dod and nasa development projects for the fpd industry and various photonics products 
flat panel display manufacturing equipment consists of sputtering and rapid thermal processing equipment for the manufacture of fpd s 
electron beam processing equipment is used for curing inks  coatings and adhesives  in the manufacture of shrink wrap films and for in line sterilization 
through the first quarter of  the company also received revenues from sales of mbe systems 
mbe systems are used for the design and manufacture of materials having the characteristics of a semiconductor that are used to produce transistors  opto electronic devices and integrated circuits 
the company acquired the mbe business from varian in and sold the business to a third party in october mbe revenues in the first quarter of were derived from sales of used mbe equipment that had not been sold in the acquisition and from other activities in connection with the winding down of the mbe business 
the company does not expect any mbe revenues in future periods 
income from discontinued operations represents results from the company s sales of night vision products  primarily sales of night vision goggles and devices 
the company sold the night vision business to a third party in may the company s operating results have historically been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations 
the company believes that its operating results will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis due to a variety of factors 
these factors include the cyclicality of the thin film disk manufacturing and disk drive industries  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of significant orders  order cancellations and shipment reschedulings  market acceptance of the company s products  unanticipated delays in design  engineering or production or in customer acceptance of product shipments  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  the timing of product announcements or introductions by the company or its competitors  the mix of systems sold  the relative proportions of sputtering systems  system components and subassemblies  changes in product development costs  expenses associated with acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations 
over the last eight quarters the company s operating income as a percentage of net revenues has fluctuated from approximately to of net revenues 
the company anticipates that its operating margin will continue to fluctuate 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company has derived a significant proportion of its net revenues from sales of its systems to manufacturers constructing new thin film disk fabrication facilities 
the construction of new thin film disk fabrication facilities involves extremely large capital expenditures  resulting in few thin film disk fabrication facilities being constructed worldwide at any particular time 
a substantial investment is also required by disk manufacturers to install and integrate additional thin film disk manufacturing equipment in connection with upgrading or expanding their existing fabrication facilities 
these costs are far in excess of the cost of purchasing the company s system 
the magnitude of such capital expenditures has caused certain thin film disk manufacturers to forego purchasing significant additional thin film disk manufacturing equipment 
consequently  only a limited number of opportunities for the company to sell it systems may exist at any given time 
according to a april report by trendfocus  an independent market research firm  as of december  there were installed disk sputtering lines worldwide and only companies in the world with five or more installed disk sputtering lines 
therefore  winning or losing an order from any particular customer can significantly affect the company s operating results 
the disk drive industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for thin film disks and for the capital equipment used to manufacture such disks  including the systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
in recent years  the disk drive industry has experienced significant growth  which  in turn  has caused significant growth in the capital equipment industry supplying manufacturers of thin film disks 
there can be no assurance that such growth will continue 
during the latter half of a number of manufacturers of hard disk drives and a number of their suppliers reported substantial losses 
many of these manufacturers attributed their problems to an excess supply of hard drives  or in the case of component suppliers  an excess supply of components for hard drives including thin film disks and the rapid change of technology which caused a number of products to become obsolete 
there can be no assurance that these industry wide problems will not result in reduced demand for the company s products in  a rescheduling of the company s existing backlog or in a reduction in future orders from the levels experienced during  in which case the company s business would be materially adversely affected 
in march of  as a result of weak orders for its disk sputtering systems  the company implemented an expense reduction plan that involved the termination of approximately of the company s work force 
as part of the expense reduction plan the company also decided to close its rocklin  california facility and transfer its rapid thermal processing operation from rocklin to the company s headquarters in santa clara 
during the first quarter of  the company will incur a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the closure of the rocklin facility and employee severance costs 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company expects its quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly and may in certain quarters be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event it is likely the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of sales of the company s disk sputtering systems and related equipment used to manufacture thin film disks for computer hard disk drives  and to a lesser extent  system components  contract research and development and rapid thermal processing systems for flat panel display manufacturing 
net revenues from the sales of sputtering systems are recognized upon customer acceptance 
system component and other system sales are recognized upon product shipment  and contract research and development is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
net revenues totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net revenues increased from to primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems and to a lesser extent as a result of an increase in net revenues from disk lubrication systems  contract research and development  contact stop start testers  rapid thermal processing equipment and components 
net revenues increased from to primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems and to a lesser extent as the result of the revenues related to sjt and lotus which where acquired in may and june  respectively 
the company s backlog of orders at december  was million 
the majority of these orders are shippable for revenue during the first half of orders for the company s disk sputtering equipment have been soft since the beginning of given the company s manufacturing lead times and its current unwillingness to build systems in anticipation of orders not yet received  it is likely that third quarter revenues and net income will be less than the levels experienced during the second half of there can be no assurance that these lower revenue levels will not extend beyond the third quarter of matsubo  the company s japanese distributor  hmt technology and trace storage technology accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues during the shipments to matsubo in were delivered to fuji electric  mitsubishi  hitachi and sony 
matsubo  seagate and hmt technology accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues during seagate  hmt technology and matsubo accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues during mbe accounted for million of net revenues in the company sold substantially all of the assets related to its mbe operation in october in exchange for of the outstanding stock of chorus corporation

substantially all of the company s sales were denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
cost of net revenues consists primarily of purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test  installation  international distributor costs  warranty costs and costs attributable to contract research and development 
gross margin for disk  flat panel and other was   and in  and  respectively 
the reduction in gross margins in from was primarily due to reduced margins on disk sputtering systems for which product costs increased more than the company s ability to increase prices  and to a lesser extent due to reduced gross margins in the company s other businesses 
gross margins increased in as the result of higher margins on disk sputtering systems during the first two quarters of mbe gross margin was above historical levels at in due to the resale at high margins of used mbe machines that the company retained after the sale of the mbe business 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of prototype materials  salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities for disk manufacturing equipment  flat panel display manufacturing equipment and research by the company s photonics technology division 
company funded research and development expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase from to was caused primarily by higher expenses related to development of disk sputtering equipment  the development of a new line of contact stop start test equipment and development of flat panel manufacturing equipment 
the million increase from to was caused primarily by an increase in expenses related to the development of disk sputtering equipment and to a lesser extent increases in net expenses related to development of flat panel manufacturing equipment  laser texturing equipment and contact stop start test equipment 
the company terminated its laser texturing development program during research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million  and million that were incurred by the company in  and  respectively  and reimbursed under the terms of a research and development cost sharing agreement with the company s japanese development partner 
at december   all of the million of funds available under this cost sharing agreement had been used 
future joint development under this agreement is contingent upon the company s ability to negotiate further amendments to the development agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain further amendments to the development agreement 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling  marketing  financial  travel  management  legal and professional services costs 
domestic sales are made by the company s direct sales force  whereas international sales are made by distributors that typically provide sales  installation  warranty and ongoing customer support 
selling  general and administrative expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net revenues 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily the result of increased marketing and administration expenses related to increased sales of disk sputtering systems and  to a lesser extent increased marketing and administrative costs at the company s lotus technology division and san jose technology division 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily the result of an increase in marketing and administrative costs related to increased sales of disk sputtering systems and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing and administrative costs at the company s lotus technology division  advanced technology division  and san jose technology division  approximately  of costs related to the cancellation of its proposed secondary stock offering in august  and the increased costs of administering and insuring a public company as a result of the company s november  initial public offering  acquired in process research and development

other income during consisted primarily of interest income and  to a lesser extent  deferred income recognized on the sale of the company s interest in chorus corporation 
discontinued operations 
in march  the company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the night vision business 
the company sold its night vision business to litton systems  inc in may accordingly  the results of operations data for the year ended december  reflects the night vision business as a discontinued operation 
net revenues included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  were million 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was  and in  and  respectively 
the company s tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates primarily due to non deductible expenses for acquired in process research and development and goodwill amortization  state income taxes  benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation and tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities in provided cash of million primarily due to net income of million  an million reduction in accounts receivable  a million increase in accrued payroll and other liabilities  a million increase in customer advances and million of depreciation and amortization  which were partially offset by an million increase in inventory and a million increase in prepaid expense and other assets 
investing activities in used cash of million primarily due to the net purchase of million of cash investments and the purchase of million of property and equipment 
financing activities in generated million of cash primarily as a result of million in net proceeds from the sale by the company of its convertible notes and million in proceeds from the sale of the company s stock to employees under the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  which were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for million under the company s stock repurchase plan 
at december   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  the company has a million revolving line of credit which expires may  borrowings bear interest at prime rate or the libor rate plus basis points 
the line of credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions 
the company intends to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months 
the company believes the existing cash and cash equivalent balances and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company may experience growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
the company may also from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing 
year the company is currently evaluating the software and computer systems it uses in order to ensure compliance with year issues 
this evaluation  and any corrective actions required  is estimated to be completed no later than december  the company does not expect to encounter significant problems or expect that material expenditures will be required to comply with year issues 
these expectations are based primarily on the fact that the company purchases all business software from third party vendors 
specific actions to be taken include reviewing all software used and assessing the vendor s plans to comply with year  testing of all hardware to ensure its ability to recognize dates after  and contacting significant suppliers to determine their ability to comply with year the expectations of the findings of this project and the date on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these expectations will be achieved and actual results could differ materially
