item business introduction national propane partners  lp  a master limited partnership the partnership or the mlp  is a delaware limited partnership formed in march to acquire  own and operate the business and assets of national propane corporation  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of triarc  national propane through national propane  lp the operating partnership  and is engaged primarily in i the retail marketing of propane to residential  commercial and industrial  and agricultural customers and to dealers that resell propane to residential and commercial customers and ii the retail marketing of propane related supplies and equipment  including home and commercial appliances 
the partnership believes it is the sixth largest retail marketer of propane in terms of volume in the united states  supplying approximately  active retail and wholesale customers in states through its full service centers located in states 
the partnership s operations are concentrated in the midwest  northeast  southeast and west regions of the united states 
the retail propane sales volume of the partnership was approximately million gallons in in  approximately of the partnership s retail sales volume was to residential customers  was to commercial and industrial customers  was to agricultural customers  and was to dealers 
sales to residential customers in accounted for approximately of the partnership s gross profit on propane sales  reflecting the higher margin nature of this segment of the market 
initial public offering prior to  national propane s business was conducted through nine regionally branded companies without central management or coordinated pricing or distribution strategies 
in july the mlp completed an initial public offering the ipo of approximately million common units representing limited partner interests together with subsequently issued common units the common units and received therefrom net proceeds aggregating approximately million 
both national propane and national propane sgp inc sgp contributed substantially all of their assets to the operating partnership the partnership conveyance as a capital contribution and the operating partnership assumed substantially all of their liabilities 
national propane and sgp then conveyed their limited partner interests in the operating partnership to the partnership 
as a result of such contributions  each of national propane and sgp have a general partner interest in the partnership and a general partner interest in the operating partnership 
in addition  national propane received in exchange for its contribution to the partnership  subordinated units the subordinated units and the right to receive certain incentive distributions 
the entity representative of both the operations of i national propane prior to the partnership conveyance and ii the partnership subsequent to the partnership conveyance is referred to herein as national 
also immediately prior to the closing of the ipo  national propane issued million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes due the first mortgage notes to certain institutional investors in a private placement the private placement 
approximately million of the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage notes the entire net proceeds of which were approximately million were used by national propane to pay a dividend to triarc companies  inc the remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage notes approximately million were contributed by national propane to the operating partnership to repay a portion of national propane s then existing bank debt and other indebtedness of national propane and certain of its subsidiaries 
after the repayment of the indebtedness described above  the net proceeds of the ipo were contributed to the operating partnership which used such proceeds to repay all remaining indebtedness under national propane s then existing bank debt  to make a million loan to triarc the partnership loan and to pay certain accrued management fees and tax sharing payments due to triarc from national propane 
concurrently with the closing of the ipo  the operating partnership also entered into a bank credit facility  which includes a revolving credit facility to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes and an acquisition facility the bank facility 
on november   the partnership issued and sold an additional  common units in a private placement resulting in net proceeds of million 
business strategy the partnership s operating strategy is to increase its efficiency  profitability and competitiveness  while better serving its customers  by building on the efforts it has already undertaken to improve pricing management  marketing and purchasing 
in addition  the partnership s strategies for growth involve expanding its operations and increasing its market share through internal growth and possibly through acquisitions 
the partnership intends to pursue internal growth at its existing service centers  and to attract new customers and expand its market base by i providing superior service  ii introducing innovative marketing programs and iii focusing on population growth areas 
the partnership operates in several growth areas of the united states  including western colorado  a rapidly growing market in which the partnership believes it is one of the leading retail marketers  in central arizona  an area that has experienced a significant rate of population growth in recent years and in northern california  an area with a substantial base of residential home heating customers 
the partnership also intends to continue to expand its business by opening new service centers  known as scratch starts  in areas where there is relatively little competition 
scratch starts typically involve minimal startup costs because the infrastructure of the new service center is developed as the customer base expands and the partnership can  in many circumstances  transfer existing assets  such as storage tanks and vehicles  to the new service center 
the partnership intends to take two approaches to acquisitions i primarily to build on its broad geographic base by acquiring smaller  independent competitors that operate within the partnership s existing geographic areas and ii to acquire propane businesses in areas in the united states outside of its current geographic base where it believes there is growth potential 
during  the partnership acquired the assets of six retail propane marketers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in january  the partnership acquired the assets of another small retail propane marketer for a purchase price of approximately million 
under its scratch start program  by december  the partnership had opened five new service centers in california  two each in minnesota and arizona and one in idaho 
industry background propane  a by product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining  is a clean burning energy source recognized for its transportability and ease of use relative to alternative stand alone energy sources 
propane is extracted from natural gas or oil wellhead gas at processing plants or separated from crude oil during the refining process 
propane is normally transported and stored in a liquid state under moderate pressure or refrigeration for economy and ease of handling in shipping and distribution 
when the pressure is released or the temperature is increased  it is useable as a flammable gas 
propane is colorless and odorless  an odorant is added to allow its detection 
propane is clean burning  producing negligible amounts of pollutants when consumed 
the partnership s retail customers fall into four broad categories residential customers  commercial and industrial customers  agricultural customers and dealers that resell propane to residential and commercial customers 
residential customers use propane primarily for space heating  water heating  cooking and clothes drying 
commercial and industrial customers use propane for commercial applications such as cooking and clothes drying and industrial uses such as fueling over the road vehicles  forklifts and stationary engines  firing furnaces  as a cutting gas and in other process applications 
agricultural customers use propane for tobacco curing  crop drying  poultry brooding and weed control 
based upon information provided by the national propane gas association the npga  a propane trade association  propane accounts for approximately to of total energy consumption in the united states  an average level that has remained relatively constant for the past ten years 
in addition  propane is now the world s most widely used alternative fuel for automobiles with approximately  and million vehicles running on propane in the united states and worldwide  respectively according to the npga 
the partnership believes  based on industry publications  that the domestic retail market for propane is approximately billion gallons annually 
products  services and marketing the partnership distributes its propane through a nationwide distribution network integrating full service centers in states 
the partnership s operations are located primarily in the midwest  northeast  southeast and west regions of the united states 
typically  service centers are found in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available 
generally  such locations consist of an office and a warehouse and service facility  with one or more  to  gallon storage tanks on the premises 
each service center is managed by a district manager and also typically employs a customer service representative  a service technician and one or two bulk truck drivers 
in the partnership served approximately  active customers 
no single customer accounted for or more of the partnership s revenues in or generally  the number of customers increases during the fall and winter and decreases during the spring and summer 
historically  approximately of the partnership s retail propane volume has been sold during the six month season from october through march  as many customers use propane for heating purposes 
consequently  sales  gross profits and cash flows from operations are concentrated in the partnership s first and fourth fiscal quarters 
year to year demand for propane is affected by the relative severity of the winter and other climatic conditions 
for example  while the frigid temperatures that were experienced by the united states in january and february of significantly increased the overall demand for propane  the unusually warm weather during the latter part of the winter of significantly reduced such demand 
the partnership believes  however  that the geographic diversity of its areas of operations helps to reduce its exposure to regional weather patterns 
in addition  retail sales to the commercial and industrial markets  while affected by economic patterns  are not as sensitive to variations in weather conditions as sales to residential and agricultural markets 
for information on the impact of annual variations in weather on the operations of the partnership  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
retail deliveries of propane are usually made to customers by means of bulk and cylinder trucks 
propane is pumped from the bulk truck  which generally holds  gallons of propane  into a stationary storage tank on the customer s premises 
the capacity of these tanks usually ranges from approximately to approximately  gallons  with a typical tank having a capacity of to gallons 
typically  service centers deliver propane to most of their residential customers at regular intervals  based on estimates of such customers usage  thereby eliminating the customers need to make affirmative purchase decisions 
the partnership also delivers propane to retail customers in portable cylinders  which typically have a capacity of gallons 
when these cylinders are delivered to customers  empty cylinders are picked up for replenishment at the partnership s distribution locations or are refilled in place 
the partnership also delivers propane to certain other retail customers  primarily dealers and large commercial accounts  in larger trucks known as transports  which have an average capacity of approximately  gallons 
propane is generally transported from refineries  pipeline terminals and storage facilities including the partnership s underground storage facilities in hutchinson  kansas and loco hills  new mexico to the partnership s bulk plants by a combination of common carriers  owner operators  railroad tank cars and  in certain circumstances  the partnership s own highway transport fleet 
the partnership also sells  leases and services equipment related to its propane distribution business 
in the residential market  the partnership sells household appliances such as cooking ranges  water heaters  space heaters  central furnaces and clothes dryers  as well as barbecue equipment and gas logs 
in the industrial market  the partnership sells or leases specialized equipment for the use of propane as fork lift truck fuel  in metal cutting and atmospheric furnaces and for portable heating for construction 
in the agricultural market  specialized equipment is leased or sold for the use of propane as engine fuel and for chicken brooding and crop drying 
the sale of specialized equipment  service income and rental income represented less than of the partnership s gross income during fiscal parts and appliance sales  installation and service activities are conducted through national sales service  inc nssi  a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of the operating partnership 
propane supply and storage the profitability of the partnership is dependent upon the price and availability of propane as well as seasonal and climatic factors 
contracts for propane are typically made on a year to year basis  but the price of the propane to be delivered depends upon market conditions at the time of delivery 
worldwide availability of both gas liquids and oil affects the supply of propane in domestic markets  and from time to time the ability to obtain propane at attractive prices may be limited as a result of market conditions  thus affecting price levels to all distributors of propane 
the partnership utilizes a hedging program which is designed to protect margins on fixed price retail sales and to mitigate the potential impact of sudden wholesale propane price increases 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
the partnership purchased propane from over domestic and canadian suppliers during  primarily major oil companies and independent producers of both gas liquids and oil 
the partnership purchases propane under both term and spot contracts 
in  the partnership purchased approximately and of its propane supplies from domestic and canadian suppliers  respectively 
approximately of propane purchases by the partnership in were on a contractual basis generally  under one year agreements subject to annual renewal  but the percentage of contract purchases may vary from year to year as determined by national 
supply contracts generally do not lock in prices but rather provide for pricing in accordance with posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major storage points  such as mont belvieu  texas and conway  kansas 
the partnership is not currently a party to any supply contracts containing take or pay provisions 
warren petroleum company warren supplied approximately of the partnership s propane in and amoco and conoco each supplied approximately 
the partnership believes that if supplies from warren  amoco or conoco were interrupted  it would be able to secure adequate propane supplies from other sources without a material disruption of its operations  however  the partnership believes that the cost of procuring replacement supplies might be significantly higher  at least on a short term basis  which could negatively affect the partnership s margins 
no other single supplier provided or more of the partnership s total propane supply during although the partnership has long standing relations with a number of its important suppliers and has generally been able to secure sufficient propane to meet its customers needs  no assurance can be given that supplies of propane will be readily available in the future 
the partnership expects a sufficient supply to continue to be available during however  increased demand for propane in periods of severe cold weather  or otherwise  could cause future propane supply interruptions or significant volatility in the price of propane 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations general 
the partnership owns underground storage facilities in hutchinson  kansas and loco hills  new mexico the partnership owns the underground storage space and leases the real property on which it is located from the state of new mexico  leases above ground storage facilities in crandon  wisconsin and orlando  florida  and owns or leases smaller storage facilities in other locations throughout the united states 
as of december   the partnership s total storage capacity was approximately million gallons including approximately one million gallons of storage capacity currently leased to third parties 
trademarks and tradenames the partnership utilizes a number of trademarks and tradenames which it owns including national propane tm  some of which have a significant value in the marketing of its products 
competition propane competes primarily with natural gas  electricity and fuel oil as an energy source  principally on the basis of price  availability and portability 
propane serves as an alternative to natural gas in rural and suburban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required 
propane is generally more expensive than natural gas on an equivalent btu basis in locations served by natural gas  although propane is sold in such areas as a standby fuel for use during peak demand periods and during interruptions in natural gas service 
the expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital costs required to expand distribution and pipeline systems 
although the extension of natural gas pipelines tends to displace propane distribution in the areas affected  the partnership believes that new opportunities for propane sales arise as more geographically remote neighborhoods are developed 
propane is generally less expensive to use than electricity for space heating  water heating  clothes drying and cooking 
although propane is similar to fuel oil in certain applications  as well as in market demand and price  propane and fuel oil have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets  reducing competition between such fuels 
because furnaces and appliances that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil and vice versa  a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment 
in addition to competing with alternative energy sources  the partnership competes with other companies engaged in the retail propane distribution business 
competition in the propane industry is highly fragmented and generally occurs on a local basis with other large full service multi state propane marketers  thousands of smaller local independent marketers and farm cooperatives 
based on industry publications  the partnership believes that the domestic retail market for propane is approximately billion gallons annually  that the largest retailers  including the partnership  account for approximately of the total retail sales of propane in the united states  and that no single marketer has a greater than share of the total retail market in the united states 
most of the partnership s service centers compete with several marketers or distributors and certain service centers compete with a large number of marketers or distributors 
each service center operates in its own competitive environment because retail marketers tend to locate in close proximity to customers in order to lower the cost of providing service 
the partnership s typical service center has an effective marketing radius of approximately miles 
the ability to compete effectively further depends on the reliability of service  responsiveness to customers and the ability to maintain competitive prices 
working capital working capital requirements for the operating partnership fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of its business 
typically  in late summer and fall  inventories are built up in anticipation of the heating season and are depleted over the winter months 
during the spring and early summer  inventories are at low levels due to lower demand 
accounts receivable reach their highest levels in the middle of the winter and are gradually reduced as the volume of propane sold declines during the spring and summer 
working capital requirements are generally met through cash flow from operations supplemented by advances under a revolving working capital facility which provides the operating partnership with a million line of credit of which million was available at march  
accounts receivable are generally due within days of delivery 
government regulation the partnership is subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
generally  these laws impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws include the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the clean air act  the occupational safety and health act  the emergency planning and community right to know act  the clean water act and comparable state statutes 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
propane is not a hazardous substance within the meaning of cercla 
however  automotive waste products  such as waste oil  generated by the partnership s truck fleet  as well as hazardous substances disposed of during past operations by third parties on the partnership s properties  could subject the partnership to cercla 
such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties in cases of non compliance or impose liability for remediation costs 
also  third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 
national fire protection association pamphlets no 
and no 
 which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane  or comparable regulations  have been adopted as the industry standard in all of the states in which the partnership operates 
in some states these laws are administered by state agencies  and in others they are administered on a municipal level 
with respect to the transportation of propane by truck  the partnership is subject to regulations promulgated under the federal motor carrier safety act 
these regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the united states department of transportation 
the partnership conducts ongoing training programs to help ensure that its operations are in compliance with applicable regulations 
the partnership maintains various permits that are necessary to operate some of its facilities  some of which may be material to its operations 
the partnership believes that the procedures currently in effect at all of its facilities for the handling  storage and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations 
national propane and the operating partnership are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the transportation  storage and distribution of propane  and the health and safety of workers  the latter of which are primarily governed by the occupational safety and health act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
for a discussion of the partnership s participation with other multi state propane marketers in litigation against the us department of transportation  see item legal proceedings 
in may  national propane was informed of coal tar contamination which was discovered at one of its properties in wisconsin 
national propane purchased the property from a company the successor which had purchased the assets of a utility that had previously owned the property 
national propane believes that the contamination occurred during the use of the property as a coal gasification plant by such utility 
to assess the extent of the problem  national propane engaged environmental consultants in based upon the information compiled to date  which is not yet complete  it appears the likely remedy will involve treatment of groundwater and the soil  including installation of a soil cap and  if necessary  excavation  treatment and disposal of contaminated soil 
the environmental consultants current range of estimated costs for remediation is from million to million 
national propane will have to agree upon the final remediation plan with the state of wisconsin 
accordingly  the precise remediation method to be used is unknown 
based on the preliminary results of the ongoing investigation  there is a potential that the contaminant plume may extend to locations down gradient from the original site 
if it is ultimately confirmed that the contaminant plume extends under such properties and if such plume is attributable to the contaminants emanating from the wisconsin property  there is the potential for future third party claims 
national propane has engaged in discussions of a general nature with the successor who has denied any liability for the costs of remediation of the wisconsin property or of satisfying any related claims 
however  national propane  if found liable for any of such costs  would still attempt to recover such costs from the successor 
national propane has notified its insurance carriers of the contamination and the likely incurrence of costs to undertake remediation and the possibility of related claims 
pursuant to a lease related to the wisconsin facility  the ownership of which was not transferred by national propane to the operating partnership at the time of the closing of the offering  the partnership has agreed to be liable for any costs of remediation in excess of amounts received from the successor and from insurance 
because the remediation method to be used is unknown  no amount within the cost ranges provided by the environmental consultants can be determined to be a better estimate 
thus national has a remaining accrual of approximately million as of december   all of which was provided in prior years  for the minimum costs estimated for the anticipated remediation method 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined and the costs of remediation and third party claims  if any  may have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations or ability to make the distributions to the holders of its common units and subordinated units 
employees as of december   the managing general partner had approximately  full time employees  of whom were general and administrative including fleet maintenance personnel  were sales  were transportation and product supply and the balance were district employees 
in addition  at december   the managing general partner had temporary and part time employees 
approximately of such full time employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on various dates in and the managing general partner believes that its relations with both its union and non union employees are satisfactory 
the partnership has no employees  however  for certain purposes  such as workers compensation claims  employees of the managing general partner who are providing services for the benefit of the partnership may also be considered to be employees of the partnership under applicable state law 
the managing general partner is reimbursed by the partnership entities at cost for all direct and indirect expenses incurred on behalf of the partnership entities  including the costs of compensation and employee benefit plans

such operating agreement may be terminated by either party at the end of any calendar year upon thirty days notice 
the partnership leases the real property from the state of new mexico pursuant to a ground lease with a termination date of november   subject to the partnership s option to extend the lease for an additional year term 
the transportation of propane requires specialized equipment 
the trucks utilized for this purpose carry specialized steel tanks that maintain the propane in a liquefied state 
as of december   the partnership had a fleet of transport truck tractors  all of which are owned by the partnership and approximately bulk delivery trucks and service and light duty trucks  all of which are owned by the partnership 
in addition  as of december   the partnership had approximately cylinder delivery vehicles and automobiles 
as of december   the partnership owned approximately  customer storage tanks with typical capacities of to gallons 
the partnership believes that it has satisfactory title to or valid rights to use all of its material properties 
substantially all of the partnership s assets other than the assets of nssi are pledged to secure the first mortgage notes and indebtedness under the bank credit facility 
in addition  some of the partnership s properties are subject to liabilities and leases and immaterial encumbrances  easements and restrictions  although the partnership does not believe that any such burdens will materially interfere with the continued use by the partnership of its properties  taken as a whole 
item legal proceedings there are a number of lawsuits pending or threatened against national 
in general  these lawsuits have arisen in the ordinary course of national s business and involve claims for actual damages  and in some cases punitive damages  arising from the alleged negligence of national or as a result of product defects or similar matters 
of the pending or threatened matters  a number involve property damage  and several involve serious personal injuries or deaths and the claims made are for relatively large amounts 
although any litigation is inherently uncertain  based on past experience  the information currently available to it and the availability of insurance coverage in certain matters  the partnership does not believe that the pending or threatened litigation of which the partnership is aware will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or its financial condition 
however  any one or all of these matters taken together may adversely affect the partnership s quarterly or annual results of operations and may limit the partnership s ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
the partnership is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the transportation  storage and distribution of propane  and the health and safety of workers  primarily the regulations promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration 
on august   the us department of transportation the dot published its final rule for continued operation of the present propane trucks the final rule 
the final rule is intended to address perceived risks during the transfer of propane 
the final rule required certain immediate changes in the partnership s operating procedures including retrofitting the partnership s cargo tanks 
the partnership  as well as the national propane gas association and the propane industry in general  believe that the final rule cannot practicably be complied with in this current form 
accordingly  on october   the partnership joined four other multi state propane marketers in filing an action against the dot in united states district court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the final rule 
on february   the court preliminarily enjoined the dot from enforcing the final rule pending the final outcome of the litigation 
at this time  the partnership cannot determine the likely outcome of the litigation or what the ultimate long term cost of compliance with the final rule will be 
in addition  certain contingent liabilities related to national propane s operations were assumed by the partnership in connection with the partnership conveyance 
these contingent liabilities include potential environmental remediation costs and related claims primarily costs and claims related to the coal tar contamination at the managing general partner s marshfield  wisconsin facility 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability relating to this matter will not exceed the amount reserved or that such matter will not have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations  financial condition or its ability to make distributions to its unitholders

general national is primarily engaged in i the retail marketing of propane to residential customers  commercial and industrial customers  agricultural customers and to dealers that resell propane to residential and commercial customers  and ii the retail marketing of propane related supplies and equipment  including home and commercial appliances 
national believes it is the sixth largest retail marketer of propane in terms of retail volume in the united states  supplying approximately  active retail and wholesale customers in states through its full service centers 
national s operations are concentrated in the midwest  northeast  southeast and west regions of the united states 
national s residential and commercial customers use propane primarily for space heating  water heating  clothes drying and cooking 
in the industrial market  propane is used as a motor fuel for over the road vehicles  forklifts and stationary engines  to fire furnaces  as a cutting gas and in other process applications 
agricultural customers use propane for tobacco curing  crop drying  poultry brooding and weed control 
dealers re market propane in small quantities  primarily in cylinders  for residential and commercial uses 
the retail propane sales volumes are dependent on weather conditions 
national sells approximately of its retail volume during the first and fourth quarters  which are the winter heating season 
as a result  cash flow is greatest during the first and fourth quarters as customers pay for their purchases 
propane sales are also dependent on climatic conditions which may affect agricultural regions 
national believes that its exposure to regional weather patterns is lessened because of the geographic diversity of its areas of operations and through sales to commercial and industrial markets  which are not as sensitive to variations in weather conditions 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of similar sales volumes 
national reports on a calendar year basis  accordingly its results are affected by two different winter heating seasons the end of the first year s heating season  national s first fiscal quarter  and the beginning of the second heating season  national s fourth fiscal quarter 
profitability is also affected by the price and availability of propane 
worldwide availability of both gas liquids and oil affects the supply of propane in domestic markets 
national does not believe it is overly dependent on any one supplier 
national primarily buys propane on both one year contracts and the spot market and generally does not enter into any fixed price take or pay contracts 
furthermore  national purchases propane from a wide variety of sources 
in  no provider supplied over of national s propane needs 
based on demand and weather conditions the price of propane can change quickly over a short period of time  in most cases the increased cost of propane is passed on to the customer 
however  in cases where increases cannot be passed on or when the price of propane escalates faster than the partnership s ability to raise customer prices  margins will be negatively affected 
the propane industry is very competitive 
national competes against other major propane companies as well as local marketers in most of its markets  with the highest concentration of competitors in the midwest united states 
propane also competes against other energy sources  primarily natural gas  oil and electricity 
the following discussion compares the results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december   and the year ended december  with the year ended december  results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues declined million  or to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease consists of a million  or  decrease in propane revenues and a million  or  decrease in revenues from other product lines 
the million decrease in propane revenues was due to volume decreases million and decreased selling prices million 
national s propane sales volume decreased million gallons  or in to million gallons compared with million gallons in reflecting a decrease of million gallons sold to existing customers  primarily residential 
this decrease in sales to existing customers was partially offset by an increase of million gallons sold due to the acquisition of six propane distributorships in and the full year effect of two acquisitions in the second half of million gallons and the opening of five new service centers in million gallons 
this propane sales volume decrease to residential customers is a result of the winter season in the first half of being warmer than the winter season in the first half of according to degree day data  published by the national climatic data center  as applied to the geographic regions of national s operations 
in addition  record high product cost caused customers to conserve in their use of propane and to shop for lower prices  resulting in some residential customer turnover and losses 
the decrease in selling prices is due to a shift in the customer mix toward lower priced non residential accounts and lower product cost 
revenues from other product lines decreased million due to i decreased terminal sublease income due to the warm winter season  ii decreased equipment rental charges in certain market areas due to competitive conditions and iii decreased appliance sales 
gross profit 
gross profit declined million  or  to million in compared with million in the gross profit decrease is attributable to i lower propane sales volume in compared with million  ii a decrease in average margin per gallon the spread between the sales price and the direct product cost million  iii an increase in operating expenses attributable to revenues million and iv a decrease in other gross profit from other product lines million 
the decrease in the average margin per gallon is due to a shift in the customer mix toward lower margin non residential customers million partially offset by increased average margin per gallon as the cost of propane declined during million 
operating expenses attributable to revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due to a non recurring charge of million for severance benefits in the fourth quarter of and increases in payroll  vehicle and depreciation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared with million in the increase is primarily a result of increased professional fees  amortization of intangibles due to the six propane distributorships acquired during and the full year effect of the stand alone operating costs incurred by the partnership partially offset by decreases in advertising and provision for doubtful accounts 
management fees 
management fees formerly paid to triarc were eliminated upon the commencement of the operations of the partnership and the partnership conveyance on july  interest expense

interest income from triarc 
interest income from triarc increased million  or  to million in compared with million in due to the full year effect of interest on the partnership loan 
other income  net 
other income  net increased million due to an increase in gains on asset sales 
provision for income taxes 
the partnership entities are not tax paying entities except for nssi 
as such  the provision for income taxes relates primarily to national s operations prior to the partnership conveyance 
the provision for income taxes for the second half of and the year ended december  does not reflect a tax provision relating to the earnings of the partnership and the operating partnership 
extraordinary charge 
the extraordinary charge of million in is the result of the early extinguishment of million of existing indebtedness and consists of the write off of deferred financing costs of million and prepayment penalties of million  net of income tax benefit of million

propane revenues increased to million in as compared to million in the million increase in propane revenues was due to increased selling prices of million and volume increases of million 
the increase in selling prices consisted of increases due to increased costs million  partially offset by decreases due to a shift in the customer mix toward lower priced non residential accounts million 
the propane sales volume increase reflects an increase of million gallons  or  in to million gallons compared with million gallons in the increase in gallons sold in was primarily to non residential customers as gallons sold to residential customers remained relatively unchanged  in spite of the fact that degree day data as applied to the geographic regions of national s operations  indicated that the year ended december  was colder than gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared with million in higher propane sales volumes contributed an additional million of gross profit in offsetting the volume increase was a decrease of million due to a decrease in the average margin per gallon sold in to as compared with in this lower margin was due to i a shift in customer mix toward lower priced non residential accounts and ii an increase in product costs which could not be fully passed on to certain customers in the form of higher selling prices 
during the average cost per gallon of propane increased over as compared to contributing to this unusual increase in propane costs were lower than normal inventories at the beginning of the heating season  higher than average use for crop drying in  higher exports to mexico due to the shut down of a major mexican gas plant  and heavy consumption during the summer of by chemical companies which use propane as a raw material 
also  offsetting the increase in gross profit due to sales volume were higher operating expenses million attributable to the cost of fuel propane for delivery vehicles and the costs associated with the start up of six new propane plants which began operations during the last quarter of and the first half of these plants had not yet achieved sufficient sales volumes in to make a positive contribution to gross profit 
gross profit from other product lines also decreased million in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in compared with million in  as increases in the provision for doubtful accounts  business taxes and rent expense as well as stand alone costs associated with the partnership effective july  were partially offset by decreased training costs associated with a new computer system incurred in and a decrease in advertising expenses 
management fees 
management fees decreased million to million in compared to million in due to management fees being eliminated upon the commencement of the operations of the partnership and the partnership conveyance on july  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in compared with million in this increase was due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates and lower amortization of deferred financing costs  primarily due to a longer commitment period

extraordinary charge 
the extraordinary charge of million in is discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities of million in consisted of i net income of million  ii non cash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization and iii a million decrease in net working capital 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to lower propane sales volumes and lower prices which caused decreased levels of accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by decreased accounts payable due to lower propane costs 
cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  reflecting capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
capital expenditures amounted to million of which million was to support the growth of operations  including million to support the development of new scratch plants  and million was for recurring maintenance capital to support current business levels 
national expects to have total capital expenditures in of approximately million consisting of million for maintenance and million for growth 
such capital expenditures will be funded by cash flow from operations and existing credit lines 
at december  national had outstanding commitments of million for such capital expenditures 
during national acquired the assets of six propane distributors for an aggregate of million including million of cash 
in january  national acquired the assets of another propane distributor for million of cash 
cash used in financing activities of million in consisted of distributions paid to unitholders of million partially offset by net proceeds of long term debt of million 
total partners capital at december  was million as compared with million at december  the decrease of million principally reflects distributions paid of million partially offset by net income of the partnership of million 
the partnership maintains a bank facility the bank facility with a group of banks which  as amended  provides for a million working capital facility to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes and a million acquisition facility  the use of which is restricted to business acquisitions and capital expenditures for growth 
at december   million and million were outstanding under the working capital facility and the acquisition facility  respectively 
the acquisition facility does not amortize prior to its conversion to a term loan in july  after which time any loans outstanding will amortize in equal quarterly installments over three years 
the working capital facility matures in full on june  national must reduce the borrowings under the working capital facility to zero for a period of at least consecutive days in each year between march and august the principal paydown 
there are no scheduled principal repayments until with respect to the first mortgage notes 
the operating partnership s obligations under both the first mortgage notes and the bank facility are secured on an equal and ratable basis by substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the managing general partner 
the partnership s principal cash requirements for are maintenance capital expenditures currently budgeted at million for the year ending december   funds for growth capital expenditures currently budgeted at million for the year ending december   business acquisitions and the principal paydown 
the partnership expects to meet such requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations  the availability under the bank facility and the million of interest income on the partnership loan 
the partnership distributes to its partners on a quarterly basis  all of its available cash 
available cash  which is defined in the partnership agreement  generally means  with respect to any quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves that is necessary or appropriate in the discretion of the managing general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business  ii comply with applicable law or any partnership debt instrument or other agreement  or iii provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partners in respect of any one or more of the next four quarters 
on february   may   august  and november  national paid quarterly distributions for the quarters ended december   march   june  and september  to unitholders of record on february   may   august  and november   respectively  each consisting of per common and subordinated unit  with a proportionate amount for the unsubordinated general partners interest  or an aggregate of  each quarter including  to the general partners related to the subordinated units and the unsubordinated general partners interest

distributions of available cash to the holder of the subordinated units are subject to the prior rights of the holders of common units to receive minimum quarterly distributions for each quarter during the subordination period  as defined  and any arrearages in the distribution of minimum quarterly distributions on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 
however  the managing general partner has agreed to forego any additional distributions on the subordinated units in order to facilitate the partnership s compliance with a covenant restriction contained in the bank facility 
such distributions on the subordinated units will be resumed when their payment will not impact compliance with such covenant 
accordingly  the partnership does not expect to pay any additional distributions on the subordinated units for the remainder of for a more detailed discussion regarding restrictions on the partnership s distributions  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
contingencies in may  national propane was informed of coal tar contamination which was discovered at one of its properties in wisconsin 
national propane purchased the property from a company the successor which had purchased the assets of a utility that had previously owned the property 
national propane believes that the contamination occurred during the use of the property as a coal gasification plant by such utility 
to assess the extent of the problem  national propane engaged environmental consultants in based upon the information compiled to date  which is not yet complete  it appears the likely remedy will involve treatment of groundwater and the soil  including installation of a soil cap and  if necessary  excavation  treatment and disposal of contaminated soil 
the environmental consultants current range of estimated costs for remediation is from million to million 
national propane will have to agree upon the final remediation plan with the state of wisconsin 
accordingly  the precise remediation method to be used is unknown 
based on the preliminary results of the ongoing investigation  there is a potential that the contaminant plume may extend to locations down gradient from the original site 
if it is ultimately confirmed that the contaminant plume extends under such properties and if such plume is attributable to the contaminants emanating from the wisconsin property  there is the potential for future third party claims 
national propane has engaged in discussions of a general nature with the successor who has denied any liability for the costs of remediation of the wisconsin property or of satisfying any related claims 
however  national propane  if found liable for any of such costs  would still attempt to recover such costs from the successor 
national propane has notified its insurance carriers of the contamination and the likely incurrence of costs to undertake remediation and the possibility of related claims 
pursuant to a lease related to the wisconsin facility  the ownership of which was not transferred by national propane to the operating partnership at the time of the closing of the offering  the partnership has agreed to be liable for any costs of remediation in excess of amounts received from the successor and from insurance 
because the remediation method to be used is unknown  no amount within the cost ranges provided by the environmental consultants can be determined to be a better estimate 
thus national has a remaining accrual of approximately million as of december   all of which was provided in prior years  for the minimum costs estimated for the anticipated remediation method 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined and the costs of remediation and third party claims  if any  may have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations or ability to make the distributions to the holders of its common units and subordinated units 
the partnership is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the transportation  storage and distribution of propane  and the health and safety of workers  primarily the regulations promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration 
on august   the us department of transportation the dot published its final rule for continued operation of the present propane trucks the final rule 
the final rule is intended to address perceived risks during the transfer of propane 
the final rule required certain immediate changes in the partnership s operating procedures including retrofitting the partnership s cargo tanks 
the partnership  as well as the national propane gas association and the propane industry in general  believe that the final rule cannot practicably be complied with in this current form 
accordingly  on october   the partnership joined four other multi state propane marketers in filing an action against the dot in united states district court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the final rule 
on february   the court preliminarily enjoined the dot from enforcing the final rule pending the final outcome of the litigation 
at this time  the partnership cannot determine the likely outcome of the litigation or what the ultimate long term cost of compliance with the final rule will be 
there are a number of lawsuits pending or threatened against national 
in general  these lawsuits have arisen in the ordinary course of national s business and involve claims for actual damages  and in some cases punitive damages  arising from the alleged negligence of national or as a result of product defects or similar matters 
of the pending or threatened matters  a number involve property damage  and several involve serious personal injuries or deaths and the claims made are for relatively large amounts 
although any litigation is inherently uncertain  based on past experience  the information currently available to it and the availability of insurance coverage in certain matters  the partnership does not believe that the pending or threatened litigation of which the partnership is aware will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or its financial condition 
however  any one or all of these matters taken together may adversely affect the partnership s quarterly or annual results of operations and may limit the partnership s ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
inflation and changing prices in general  inflation has not had any significant impact on national in recent years since inflation rates generally remained at relatively low levels and changes in propane prices  in particular  have been dependent on factors generally more significant than inflation  such as weather and availability of supply 
however  to the extent inflation affects the amounts national pays for propane as well as operating and administrative expenses  national attempts to limit the effects of inflation through passing on propane cost increases to customers in the form of higher selling prices to the extent it can do so as well as cost controls and productivity improvements 
as such  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on national s profitability and national does not believe normal inflationary pressures will have a material adverse effect on future results of operations of national 
year the partnership has undertaken a study of its functional application systems to determine their compliance with year issues and  to the extent of noncompliance  the required remediation 
an assessment of the readiness of third party entities with which the partnership has relationships  such as its suppliers  customers  payroll processors and others  is ongoing 
as a result of such study  the partnership believes the majority of its systems are year compliant 
however  certain systems  which are significant to the partnership  require remediation 
the partnership currently estimates it will complete the required remediation by the end of the first half of the current estimated cost of such remediation is not expected to be material 
such costs  other than software  will be expensed as incurred
