overview opti has grown since its founding in to become an independent volume supplier of notebook chipset products to the personal computer market 
during  the company shipped more than five million core logic and audio chipsets to more than pc and motherboard manufacturers and add on board manufacturers located primarily in asia and the united states 
this past year was one of transition for the company as it experienced a significant reduction in revenue 
the company recently announced that it has retained ubs securities  an investment banking firm  to advise the company on evaluating and executing a plan to maximize shareholder value in the near term

compared to net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  
this decrease in sales was attributable to decreased sales of chipsets supporting the company s desktop core logic business segment and decreased sales from the company s audio line 
in the company shipped approximately million chipsets as compared to approximately million chipsets in revenue from core logic products was approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products audio and graphics 
the mix of revenues within the core logic area shifted to notebook core logic products in and continued in as the company had no major product wins in for desktop products 
it is likely that the company will experience ongoing shifts in its revenue mix 
no assurances can be given that future revenues will reflect this product mix trend 
gross margin for increased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this increase in gross margin for as compared to was primarily attributable to inventory write downs taken on some of the company s pentium class desktop core logic products and reductions in selling prices for the company s pentium class desktop core logic products during fiscal the company is likely to face continued potential inventory risks and adjustments if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected  as in the case of some of its notebook core logic and audio products 
the markets for the company s products are also subject to severe price competition and price declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in reducing its product costs rapidly enough to increase its gross margin level or that further substantial reductions in notebook core logic prices will not result in future losses

this reduction was partially offset by increases in the company s notebook core logic and audio business segments 
in the company shipped approximately million chipsets as compared to approximately million chipsets in revenue from core logic products were approximately of net sales for as compared to approximately in the remaining of revenue in was from peripheral products audio and graphics 
the mix of revenues within the core logic area has shifted to notebook core logic products which represented approximately of total core logic sales in as compared with approximately in the company s declines in its desktop core logic business have been largely due to intel s aggressive push to dominate the desktop core logic market and the company s inability to compete successfully over this period 
this push from intel which began in corresponds to their aggressive marketing of the pentium platform and their successful attempts to control a significant share of the pentium motherboard market  utilizing their own processors and core logic 
gross margin for decreased to approximately of net sales as compared to approximately in this decrease in gross margin for the year was primarily attributable to inventory write downs taken on some of the company s pentium class desktop core logic products  reductions in selling prices for the company s pentium class desktop core logic products  increased overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue  and reductions in selling prices for the company s audio products 
research and development expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million for the increase in research and development expenses from to is primarily related to the company s shift in market focus over the last year as the company has focused more heavily on notebook directed technologies and in the multimedia areas 
the company has invested in technologies which  although not currently productized  may be integrated into future products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased approximately to million  compared with million in this increase in sg a expenses from to was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses related to the class action lawsuit brought against the company  partially offset by a reduction in sales expenses relating to decreased net sales

in  the company generated cash from operations of million primarily due to reductions in inventories and accounts receivable  offset  in part  by a decrease in accounts payable and a net loss for the year 
the company s investing activities generated cash of million and used cash of million in and  respectively 
the cash generated in was primarily due to proceeds of million from the sale of the company s audio line  partially offset by an investment into short term investments of approximately million and a payment of approximately million to united microelectronics corporation umc as partial payment under the terms of the agreement that the company signed with umc 
as of december  the company has no further obligations under this agreement 
during  the company made capital expenditures  including obligations under a capital lease  of approximately million 
these expenditures related primarily to the acquisition of computer equipment and high speed circuit testers for use in the development and testing of chipset products

in  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement and foundry venture agreement with united microelectronics corporation umc 
under the original terms of the agreements  the company received an immediate supply of wafers from umc and the company committed to invest the equivalent of million in cash for a equity interest in the foundry venture 
the company made a payment of approximately million in january per the original agreement  and an additional million in december the company does not have board of director or management representation in the foundry venture 
due to the company s small percentage ownership and minor influence on the operations of the foundry venture  the company will continue to account for this investment on the cost basis 
the company s manufacturing plans and expenditure levels are based primarily upon sales forecasts 
typically  the company orders products from foundries pursuant to non cancelable purchase orders on a rolling twelve week basis while its customers generally place product orders approximately four weeks prior to delivery 
these customer orders may be canceled without significant penalty 
the company anticipates that the rate of new orders will vary significantly from month to month 
as a result  backlog can fluctuate significantly 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments do not occur when expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and working capital of million 
the company believes that the existing sources of liquidity as well as its million line of credit will satisfy the company s projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the end of the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
management is in the process of working with its software vendors to assure that the company is prepared for the year management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer systems improvements to be year compliant 
however  significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance 
any year compliance problem of either the company or its suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects
