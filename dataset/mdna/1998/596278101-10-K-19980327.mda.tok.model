international exposure the company has manufacturing operations located in asia and distribution operations in asia  europe  latin america  and canada 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net sales in the foreseeable future 
some sales by the foreign operations are in local currency and an increase in the relative value of the us dollar against such currencies would lead to the reduction in consolidated sales and earnings 
foreign exchange losses have not historically been material 
however  foreign currency exposures are currently not specifically hedged and there can be no assurances that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
year compliance the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause our systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company is currently implementing new information systems to enhance its current transaction processing and information reporting capabilities 
these systems are year compliant 
costs to modify existing computer systems and applications have not been  and are not expected  to be material 
if the company s systems implementation plan is not successful  there could be a significant disruption of the company s ability to transact business with its major customers and suppliers
