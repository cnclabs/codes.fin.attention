outlook issues and uncertainties the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and to remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
the company competes with companies which have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products than the company  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with satellite service providers  the company has positioned itself to provide end to end solutions to its customers 
competition in the market for the company s mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance  and price 
the company s broadcast digital video products are in production and competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
the company believes it has positioned itself to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of its product and market strategies  which have proven successful in increasing revenues from this sector 
in the cable television market the company believes that the competitive position for many of its products is dominant 
however  the unity product family is potentially competing with significant and established firms 
wci believes that it maintains a competitive advantage in the market for advertising supported networks through its ability to provide regionalized programming and control 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including the company s digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
the company believes that its continued success in all of its markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity 
satellite capacity is scarce due to pressures on both the supply and demand side of the market 
on the supply side  satellites are extremely expensive to launch  build  and maintain 
the useful life of a satellite is limited by the amount of positioning fuel that can be carried 
also  the placement of satellites is regulated by the federal communications commission fcc and therefore the number of satellites within range of any given location is limited 
on the demand side  the cost of receive hardware is being steadily reduced through advancing technology 
the reduction in the cost of network hardware increases the economic feasibility of a greater number of networks 
this is evidenced by the trend in both television and radio towards narrow casting to well defined market segments as opposed to broadcasting to the general population 
digital compression technology allows a four to ten fold  or more  increase in the throughput of a satellite channel 
for the network  this compression represents an opportunity to reduce the cost of satellite use 
for the satellite operator it represents an opportunity to increase the revenues generated by an expensive asset 
due to existing satellite transponder contracts and the cost of replacing existing analog hardware  the digital conversion of major networks is taking longer than anticipated 
these network conversions are expected to occur in the near future  but it is impossible to predict the precise timing of customers internal decision processes 
management believes the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in the company s revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by the company 
the company has invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
the company purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
the company s inventory reserve of  at august   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess  or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand  and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should the company s sales efforts not be successful 
the company s gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
certain raw materials  video sub components  and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from single or limited sources 
although the company believes that all single source components currently are available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has made significant investments in capitalized software costs principally related to the digital audio and video products 
at august  capitalized software costs were  these costs are being amortized over anticipated future gross revenues for the product or the estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes  and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
during fiscal   of capitalized software costs were written off to cost of sales due to a reduction of expected revenues on certain slow moving products 
the industry in which the company operates is subject to rapid technology changes and frequent product introductions 
the company expects to remain committed to such research and development expenditures as are required to effectively compete and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design in its future products 
the company had an accumulated deficit of  at august  the company is very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if the revenues of the company do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for its satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume standardized production environment 
year state of readiness management of the company has reviewed the company s current information systems and has found them  with a few minor exceptions  to be year compliant 
however  the company is currently in the process of replacing their older information systems with new systems that offer easier access to more data and are certified to be able to handle the year transition 
management of the company has reviewed and tested the company s phone  voice mail  e mail  and security systems and all are believed to be year compliant 
utility companies have been contacted and have reported to the company that only minor problems have been noted in regards to their billing software as a result of their year testing completed to date 
the company has requested year compliance statements from all major vendors 
there have been no indications that major vendors will not be year compliant 
however  there can be no absolute assurances in this regard and their failure to be compliant remains a possibility 
if vendors are not year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find suitable alternate suppliers and contract with them on reasonable terms  or at all  and such inability could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
all test equipment used in engineering  service  and manufacturing departments has been reviewed and all are year compliant 
all of the company s products have been reviewed for year compliance 
all are compliant with the exception of certain minor problems in the schedule and repetitive scheduler programs of an older version of uplink software 
all customers affected by this are being offered a migration path to newer software which is year compliant 
costs to address the year issues management of the company believes that although the evaluation of internal systems is still in process  the impact of the year transition on the company s internal systems will not result in material costs to the company or have a material adverse impact on future results 
risks of the year issues the main risk to the company with respect to year is the failure of major vendors and service providers to be year compliant 
failure on their part could result in delays in obtaining parts  increased cost of parts  and overall inability to manufacture product in the event of a shutdown of major utility providers 
major vendors and service providers have reported to the company that they will be year compliant 
the company cannot estimate the financial impact of any failure to be year compliant by such third party vendors and service providers 
contingency plans the company does not have a contingency plan for year compliance because it does not anticipate that it will fail to be year compliant  particularly in relation to those systems  software programs  and hardware that are under its control 
however  there can be no assurances that all measures being taken to avoid year problems will be effective and as such  unforeseen issues could arise that could lead to a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition
