item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following is an analysis of the company s results of operation  liquidity and capital resources 
to the extent that such analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include competing in a saturated industry against modern and larger fleets  the ability of the company to obtain additional financing for the acquisition of additional ships  a high percentage of debt on assets owned by the company  the potential for additional governmental regulations  the need for expensive upgrades and or maintenance to aging vessels  general economic factors in markets where the company operates  and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
with respect to the company s cruise operations  the company earns revenues primarily from i the sale of passenger tickets  which include accommodations  meals  substantially all shipboard activities  and airfare and hotel packages  if applicable  and ii the sale of goods and services on board the cruise ships including  but not limited to  casino gambling enchanted isle and enchanted capri only  liquor sales and concession income 
the company s operating expenses include travel agency commissions  shipboard costs of goods sold and all shipboard operating expenses  including food  fuel  port charges  crew wages and benefits  cabin consumables  entertainment  ship insurance  ship maintenance expenses  vessel management fees and transportation and lodging airfare  hotel  and transfer costs  if applicable

other income expense includes interest expense and interest income 
the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars 
with respect to sea comm s operations  the company earns revenue primarily from reimbursements from sea comm for all operating costs  food costs and all of the principal and interest due on the portion of the effjohn loan attributable to the universe explorer assuming such effjohn loan was still in existence during the approximately days each year the vessel is used in the semester at sea and alaska programs 
as the majority owner of sea comm  the company includes all of sea comm s revenues and expenses in its consolidated financial statements and makes an appropriate entry to account for the minority interest of its partner 
because the semester at sea program is operated by seawise pursuant to a charter  the income and losses of the semester at sea program are substantially realized by seawise  not sea comm 
with respect to the alaska and caribbean wec programs  however  all income and losses are borne by sea comm 
with respect to capri cruises  the company earns income from the profit or loss of the capri cruises venture as a whole 
because the company owns exactly half of capri cruises  it accounts for its interest in capri cruises using the equity method and does not consolidate the revenues and expenses of the venture in its consolidated financial statements 
instead  such financial statements are prepared independently and the company includes an appropriate line item for the net income or loss from this unconsolidated joint venture in its financial statements 
the following table presents statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues the company years ended september  revenues expenses operating selling and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating income other income expense net earnings before provision for preferred stock dividend the company has included the fiscal loss from the fire on the universe explorer as other income expense 
due to its new orleans point of embarkation  the company s revenues are more seasonal than other cruises with similar itineraries that depart from florida ports 
the greatest demand for the company s cruises occurs in june through august  and demand from february through may and november through december is also very good 
the company s slowest months are january  september and october 
results of operations year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues increased by  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher passenger yields and an eight day charter  on the company s new orleans itinerary 
revenues also increased during fiscal due to the increase in load factors for the alaska program which increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues 
the company s operating expenses decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of the increase in revenues  as a majority of the company s operating expenses are fixed costs 
marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher expenses were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses 
additionally  the company operated more wec alaska and caribbean cruises during fiscal than in fiscal  which required additional advertising and promotional expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the additional capital expenditures incurred by the company in conjunction with meeting its solas requirements on its two owned vessels 
interest expense  net  decreased by  or from fiscal to fiscal due to lower outstanding principal amounts on the company s loans 
seawise s interest in the company s sea comm joint venture is reflected in the  and  line item for minority interest share in loss of consolidated joint venture for fiscal and  respectively 
sea comm lost  during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal the decline in such loss was primarily due to the increase in load factors for the alaska program which increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues and a better net result 
seawise  through its minority interest  absorbs approximately of the company s loss on the sea comm joint venture 
the company accounts for the capri cruises joint venture under the equity method 
the company s investment in capri cruises resulted in a net loss of  for the period ended september  these losses were due to costs related to the start up operation  including losses related to the late delivery of the vessel and other expenses for which capri cruises was not contractually responsible 
the company expects capri cruises to become profitable in the future  however  capri cruises is expected to continue to incur losses  on a declining basis  in the near future as it defines its market 
such losses  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s operations 
the provision for preferred stock dividend decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of the conversion of all of the company s series a preference shares into common stock during fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  and no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these statements are effective for fiscal years commencing after december  the company will be required to comply with the provisions of these statements in fiscal the company does not expect these new standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and or disclosures 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues increased by  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the number of ships operated each month by the company during these periods 
during fiscal  the company operated for approximately ship months as compared to approximately ship months for fiscal ship months are the aggregate number of months in which the company s ships operated during a fiscal year 
revenues also increased during fiscal due to the company s operation of the alaska program for a total of days during fiscal  which generated greater revenues than the summer semester at sea voyage days and alaska program days operated in fiscal despite this increase  the load factors for the alaska program declined from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal finally  the company has experienced greater load factors during fiscal on its new orleans itinerary than in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues 
the company s operating expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was due to increased traffic and passenger days in fiscal  and lower load factors and relatively higher operating costs for the alaska and caribbean programs  which offers luxury cruise cuisine and luxury cabin services 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal as a result of the prepaid drydock costs incurred in fiscal  the amortization of these costs resulted in higher operating costs of  in fiscal versus  in fiscal marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher expenses were due to the company operating more wec alaska and caribbean cruises during fiscal than in fiscal which resulted in higher marketing costs for the company than it incurred when the semester at sea program operated its summer semester 
such increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs for the company s new orleans itinerary 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the additional capital expenditures incurred by the company in conjunction with meeting its solas requirements on the two vessels as well as a full year of depreciation on the universe explorer which was in operation for approximately months in fiscal versus months in fiscal interest expense  net  increased by  or from fiscal to fiscal due to the company s capitalization  in fiscal  of approximately months of interest incurred with respect to the universe explorer  which had not yet been placed in service 
seawise s interest in the company s sea comm joint venture is reflected in the  and  line item for minority interest share in loss earnings of consolidated joint venture for fiscal and respectively 
sea comm lost  during fiscal as compared to net earnings of  in fiscal this loss was due primarily to the decreased load factors during the wec programs operated by sea comm in fiscal as a result of losses sustained during the caribbean and alaska programs  seawise  through its minority interest  absorbs approximately of the company s loss on these programs 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital deficiency was  and  at september  and  respectively 
the company s working capital deficiency at september  and was primarily due to the inclusion  in non current assets  of a  deposit securing the company s fmc bond 
the corresponding liability  customer deposits  which was  and  at september  and  respectively  is included in current liabilities 
the primary reason for the increase in the company s working capital deficiency from fiscal is the company s investment in capri cruises and capital expenditures in sea comm 
cash flows from operations provided   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows for fiscal consisted primarily of increases in unearned revenues due to the addition of the enchanted capri to the company s fleet and collection of the insurance claim receivable  and was partially offset by increases in restricted cash  prepaid expenses  and amounts due to from affiliates 
the company s cash flow used in investing activities in fiscal exceeded the fiscal outlay by  the primary reason for the increase was the company s investment of million in capri cruises 
additionally  the company continued its planned capital expenditures in connection with the maintenance of its vessels 
the company s cash flow used by financing activities decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of its convertible subordinated debentures 
at september   the company owed  to the effjohn lender in connection with the commodore acquisition 
the effjohn loan was secured by substantially all of the assets of new commodore  including preferred ships mortgages on both the enchanted isle and universe explorer  and bears interest at libor plus at september  
in january the company and the effjohn lender amended the effjohn loan to provide for monthly payments of interest and principal for the duration of the effjohn loan 
on december   the company borrowed million under the new key loan agreement 
in conjunction with this loan agreement  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an affiliate of key  whereby the interest rate on the key loan is fixed at over the term of the loan 
the monthly principal payments of the key loan are fixed for the first year at  and the remainder of the loan is based on an amortization schedule of years 
the remaining unpaid principal and interest is due on december   the date of maturity 
the proceeds from the key loan  which is secured by a first preferred ship s mortgage on the universe explorer  were used to repay a portion of the effjohn loan and for working capital 
in the event that the company is required to withhold income tax on any amounts due to the effjohn lender or key  the company has agreed to pay the required amount to be withheld and pay the effjohn lender or key the full amount of interest due under its agreements with the company 
the terms of the effjohn and key loans place certain restrictions on the company 
first  the company is not permitted to place any additional liens on any of its assets including the enchanted isle without the prior consent of the effjohn lender 
second  the company is prohibited from paying more than of its net profits as dividends 
the key loan also prohibits the company from placing any additional liens on the universe explorer and requires that the company meet certain financial covenants 
on april   the company borrowed million on an unsecured basis  from an unrelated third party 
the company repaid a portion of this amount in august and renewed the loan for the balance of million 
this amount was paid in full in december the interest on the loan was per annum 
on july   the universe explorer had a fire on board  which resulted in the death of five crew members and loss of revenues during the day period the ship was out of service 
the majority of the losses by the passengers and crew  damage to the hull and machinery of the vessel and loss of hire is covered by the company s insurance policies  subject to applicable deductibles 
as a result  as of september  and the company had an insurance receivable balance of and  respectively 
in december  the company sold  of its convertible subordinated debentures that were due on december  the company sold these debentures at a discount 
in may  the company exercised its right to demand conversion of the debentures into  shares of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately  after deducting brokers commissions and expenses of the offering 
the company capitalized approximately  of the discount and expenses of the offering to deferred interest expense and offset the unamortized balance of approximately  against stockholders equity upon conversion 
in january  the company will take the universe explorer out of service primarily for the installation of a sprinkler system aboard the vessel 
the installation of the sprinkler system  which will bring the ship into compliance with solas work to be completed on or before october   is expected to be completed in february the cost of the installation of the sprinkler system is estimated at million 
the company expects to pay for such costs with the proceeds of the key loan and the proceeds of additional financings to be obtained by the company with the assistance of its joint venture partner  seawise 
the company expects to service such additional debt through payments that will be received by the company  from seawise  that become due pursuant to an agreement between the company and seawise 
during fiscal  the company anticipates that it may also require additional capital for acquisitions of additional vessels or new business opportunities 
although the company has entered into a non binding letter of intent to form one joint venture to operate a vessel between san diego  california and rosarito  baja california  mexico  the company has not entered into a definitive agreement for such business opportunity or any other proposed venture  and thus cannot estimate the amount of capital it may require for this venture  if it proceeds  or for any other business opportunity preliminarily under consideration by the company 
in the event the company proceeds with any additional business opportunities  it anticipates that the capital requirements therefore will be funded from cash from operations or from financings arranged in connection therewith 
with respect to the company s existing operations  the company expects to fund the operating cash needs for such operations  such as the company s new capri cruises venture  from cash flow from its established operations until such ventures become profitable 
capri cruises suffered certain unanticipated expenses during its initial operations as a result of the failure of the other party to the charter to meet certain of its contractual obligations associated with the delivery of the vessel 
the company plans to pursue claims for its losses against such party 
in addition  capri cruises is continuing to experience losses related to its start up as it defines its market 
the company expects that such losses will decline as capri cruises establishes its market niche 
half of such losses will be funded by the company s partner  isle of capri 
there can be no assurances that capri cruises losses will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or a miscalculation  causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
due to the expansion of the company s business  the company has recently purchased a new as for its reservations system  along with the operating systems  that are the latest versions available 
the company also installed new workstations for most of its non reservations staff 
the equipment was installed after the company s fiscal year end and will be included in capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  the company is in the process of installing a new general ledger and accounts payable system that will be fully functional by the second quarter of fiscal the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has already evaluated its on board point of sale computer equipment and reservations computer software and made the changes and upgrades necessary  based on the opinion of the consultants and vendors it has hired for such purpose  to assure that such equipment will function properly in the year the company believes that it has identified all year problems with respect to its own computer equipment and software 
the company has also contacted some of its significant vendors  customers and service providers  including its technical manager  to determine the extent to which such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from or by such entities are year compliant 
a mailing to the balance of the company s significant vendors and follow up mailing to significant vendors and service providers that did not initially respond  or whose responses were deemed unsatisfactory by the company  will be conducted in january the response from the company s initial inquiries have not yielded enough information for the company to determine whether such vendors and service providers will be year compliant on a timely basis 
the company has incurred an immaterial amount in costs associated with the identification and remediation of its year issues as it has reprogrammed its reservations system using in house personnel 
the cost of the new as system  internal network of workstations and the accounts payable general ledger system is approximately    and  respectively 
if there exist other year issues that the company has not identified  or if the company s vendors and service providers fail to identify and remediate their year issues on a timely basis  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or its relationships with its customers  vendors and service providers 
the company has not yet begun a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including the loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure of the company and certain of its significant vendors and service providers to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning during its fiscal year 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  and remediation and the dates upon which the company will complete various actions are based upon management s best estimates 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues and the ability of the company to require its vendors and service providers to thoroughly identify  assess and remediate their year issues 
in addition  variability of definitions of compliance with year may lead to different levels of compliance by the company  its vendors and service providers 
no assurance can be given that the company and its significant vendors and service providers will be year compliant on a timely basis  or that a partial lack of compliance will not lead to claims against the company  the magnitude of which are not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant to date 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate instruments  with respect to both its liquid assets and its debt instruments 
the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents  including its deposit to secure its fmc certificate of financial responsibility  which equals  in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate declines 
an immediate decline of in interest rates would reduce the company s annual interest income by  the key loan is a variable rate loan  however  the company has purchased interest rate protection for such loan in the form of an interest rate swap 
as a result  although the key loan bears interest at the prime rate plus basis points  the interest rate swap provides that the rate shall effectively be fixed at over the term of the loan 
the effjohn loan bears interest at libor plus  and thus is affected by changes in interest rates 
in the event that interest rates increased by  the company s interest obligation would increase by    and  respectively  in each of its fiscal years    and
