item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors affecting the company and or its industries 
overview the company was formed in its first product was a inch floppy disk drive for the ibm ps personal computer 
at the time  ibm was shipping the ps with only a inch floppy disk drive  although the software and data of most computer users were still stored on inch formats 
the company subsequently began producing aftermarket disk drive upgrade products for computer products sold by other manufacturers  and such upgrade products continue to be an important area of focus of the company s business  and in fiscal began to manufacture and market cd rom servers and arrays  which allow network users to simultaneously access information contained on cd rom 
in fiscal  sales of cd servers and arrays represented of net sales  while sales of hard disk drive upgrade products and raid and tape backup subsystem products represented and of net sales  respectively 
during fiscal  the company determined to group sales of intelligent network storage products by combining sales of cd servers and arrays together with sales of raid and tape backup systems 
during fiscal sales of intelligent network storage products increased  while at a slower growth rate  while the company also saw increased sales of disk drive upgrade storage systems for notebook computers 
as a result  in fiscal  sales of intelligent network storage products  represented approximately of net sales  while sales of hard disk drive upgrade products represented of net sales 
during fiscal  the company experienced a reduction in the sales of cd servers and arrays  a reduction in the sales of commodity disk drive upgrade storage subsystems  and an increase in the sales of disk drive upgrade storage systems for notebook computers 
in the addition  in fiscal  the company acquired the operations of megabyte and invincible see above and recorded their sales from the dates of their respective acquisition by the company 
while the sales of megabyte and invincible were of higher capacity storage subsystems  their sales did not fully offset the slowing growth of cd servers and arrays  and as a result  approximately and of the company s fiscal net sales were of intelligent network storage products and disk drive upgrade subsystems  respectively 
see business products and technology 
the company generally records sales upon product shipment 
the company presently maintains agreements with many of its computer resellers  vars and distributors that allow limited returns including stock balancing and price protection privileges 
the company has in the past experienced high return rates 
during fiscal and  customer returns and price protection charges represented approximately and of gross sales  respectively 
the company maintains reserves for anticipated returns including stock balancing and price protection privileges 
these reserves are adjusted at each financial reporting date to state fairly the anticipated returns including stock balancing and price protection claims relating to each reporting period 
generally  the reserves will increase as sales and corresponding returns increase 
in addition  under a product evaluation program established by the company  computer resellers  vars  distributors and end users generally are able to purchase products on a trial basis and return the products within a specified period if they are not satisfied 
evaluation units are not recorded as sales until the customer has paid for such units 
the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars although sales of megabyte are denominated in german marks  and accordingly  the company does not believe that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have had or will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  except to the extent that such fluctuations could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to end users in a particular country  leading to a reduction of sales in that country 
historically  the company s gross margins have experienced significant volatility 
the company s gross margins vary significantly by product line  and  therefore  the company s overall gross margin varies with the mix of products sold by the company 
for example  sales of low capacity disk drive commodity storage subsystems  generally result in lower gross margins than sales of cd servers and arrays  disk drive storage upgrade subsystems for notebook computers and raid products 
as sales of higher margin products have become a larger percentage of the company s total sales  the company has experienced a corresponding increase in its overall gross margins 
however  the company s gross margins were negatively impacted in fiscal by the inclusion commencing february of sales of megabyte  which had experienced gross margins of approximately during such period  well below the company s average gross margins 
the company s markets are also characterized by intense competition and declining average unit selling prices as products mature over the course of the relatively short life cycle of individual products  which have often ranged from six to twelve months 
in addition  the company s gross margins may be adversely affected by availability and price increases associated with key products and components from the company s suppliers  some of which have been in short supply  and inventory obsolescence resulting from older generation products or the unexpected discontinuance of third party components 
finally  the company s margins vary with the mix of its distribution channels and with general economic conditions 
for any of the foregoing reasons  the company s overall margin could decline in the future from the levels experienced in recent quarters

results of operations during fiscal years  each fiscal year ended on the friday of  or nearest to  july during fiscal  the company modified its accounting policies so that each fiscal year would end on july as a result  fiscal included four additional days 
no prior periods have been adjusted or restated 
comparison of years ended july   july  and july  the following table sets forth the company s statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended july  july  july  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses inprocess r d charge operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes 
net income loss net sales net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal net sales increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of the company s cd servers and arrays and increased sales of its disk drive upgrade products and raid products 
net sales slightly increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of increases in sales of hard disk drive subsystem upgrade products for notebook computers  and the inclusion of sales of megabyte and invincible from the dates of their respective acquisition by the company 
the increased sales of products above offset the decline in sales of cd servers and arrays including sales of higher performance cd servers which the company experienced in fiscal for fiscal  the slight increases in sales were somewhat offset by increased allowances for anticipated sales returns and price protection charges as the company increased the percentage of its net sales sold to customers who have contractual return and price protection rights 
international sales  primarily to european customers and secondarily to middle eastern  latin american and pacific rim customers  were million  and million  and accounted for approximately  and of net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales decreased in absolute dollars slightly in fiscal as a result of a strengthened us dollar and reduced sales of cd rom servers and arrays due to increased competition in international markets 
such sales more than doubled from fiscal to fiscal as the company s international sales in fiscal included the sales of megabyte  all of which were made to international customers  primarily those in europe and the middle east 
see risk factors risks of international sales and operations 
gross profit the company s gross profit totaled million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s gross margin increased from in fiscal to approximately in fiscal due primarily to a continuing shift in product mix toward higher margin cd servers and arrays as well as an increase in gross margins for the company s cd servers and arrays  and  to a lesser extent  due to an increase in gross margins on the company s hard disk drive upgrade and raid products 
gross margins decreased to in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of megabyte sales  which were made at significantly lower gross margins  combined with the effect of increasing competition and pricing pressures on the company s disk drive upgrade subsystems for notebook computers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and further increased to million in fiscal and further increased to million in fiscal these expenses represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to increased marketing expenses associated with advertising  direct mail and channel telemarketing  as well as increases in sales commissions and general and administrative staffing necessary to support the company s growth 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to continued increases in marketing  including co op advertising costs  and direct mail and advertising  combined with increases in other expenses to support the company s growth 
the company paid officer bonuses of 
million and 
million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  and  bad debt expense was   and  as the company experienced lower losses on bad debts in fiscal research and development expenses and one time write off of in process research and development costs research and development expenses  consisting primarily of personnel expenses  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and further increased to million in fiscal these expenses represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the slight dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from the company s enhanced efforts to develop its cd server and array product lines and raid subsystems 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the company s expanded efforts to develop new cd servers and raid products and to develop cd force  a cd rom network server incorporating procom s proprietary software data access management system 
for fiscal  research and development expenses increased by more than over fiscal  as the company more than doubled its personnel costs  including the use of contract programmers 
the increased expenses in fiscal reflect intensified efforts to further develop both hardware and software capabilities and applications for its cd force and raid products 
the company expects that its research and development expenses will continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales as it futher develops increasingly complicated network attached storage solutions for high capacity storage applications 
in connection with the acquisition of invincible  the company identified and valued the cost of technology which had not  at the date of the acquisition  reached the stage of technological feasibility  and for which no alternative future use was foreseeable 
the company determined that approximately million of the total purchase price of approximately million would be expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining net purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired was allocated to various components of goodwill 
see acquisitions  below 
interest income and expense the company maintains a working capital line of credit to support its accounts receivable and inventory levels 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as the company s sales  and resulting accounts receivable and inventory levels  increased  although the use of the company s credit line to support that increase was reduced in december  when the company completed its initial public offering  and reduced amounts outstanding under its credit lines 
during fiscal  the company incurred interest costs of  in connection with a small credit line of megabyte 
the company invested the net proceeds of the initial public offering  after repaying amounts owed under its line of credit  in various investment grade commercial papers with maturities of less than days and realized approximately  and  in interest income for fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes the company s effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal and  the company s effective tax rate approximated federal and state statutory rates  with moderate reductions due to the company s use of its fsc 
for fiscal  the company received benefits from a research and development credit  while the fiscal benefit was significantly reduced due to legislation which temporarily denied the credit 
for fiscal  the effective rate continued to approximate the effective statutory rate as the company received increased research and development credit  offset somewhat by a reduced fsc benefit due to reduced sales by procom to international customers see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general comments the company s results of operations have in the past varied significantly and are likely in the future to vary significantly as a result of a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the volume and timing of orders received during the period  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  product line maturation  the impact of price competition on the company s average selling prices  the availability and pricing of components for the company s products  changes in distribution channel mix and product returns or price protection charges from customers 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
although the company has experienced growth in sales in recent periods  there can be no assurance that the company will experience growth in the future or be profitable on an operating basis in any future period 
in addition  due to the short product life cycles that characterize the company s markets  a significant percentage of the company s sales each quarter may result from new products or product enhancements introduced in that quarter 
since the company relies on new products and product enhancements for a significant percentage of sales  failure to continue to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements or failure of these products or product enhancements to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  as the company has planned and implemented new products  it has experienced reductions in sales and gross profit of older generation products as customers have anticipated new products 
these reductions have in the past given  and could continue to give  rise to charges for obsolete or excess inventory  returns of older generation products by computer resellers  vars and distributors or substantial price protection charges 
see risk factors rapid technological change  short product life cycles and customer concentration  distribution strategy risks  inventory protection 
from time to time  the company has experienced and may in the future experience inventory obsolescence resulting from the unexpected discontinuance of third party components  such as disk drives  included in the company s products 
to the extent the company is unsuccessful in managing product transitions  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also has historically capitalized on short term market opportunities for volume purchases of certain components at favorable prices 
for example  in the quarter ended july   the company capitalized on a one time opportunity to sell a significant volume of high capacity disk drive upgrade products purchased at below market prices in the prior quarter  which resulted in a price advantage to the company that enhanced the company s sales and results of operations for that quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to capitalize on such opportunities in the future 
in addition  the company s fiscal second quarter sales have historically remained relatively flat due primarily to heavy reseller participation in trade shows that detract from reseller selling efforts  end user budget constraints that restrict end user purchases  and a higher than average number of holidays during that quarter 
liquidity and capital resources for the past three fiscal years  the company has satisfied its operating cash requirements principally through net income  supplemented by periodic borrowings of funds under its working capital line of credit and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and the cash it raised when it completed its initial public offering in december net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  and net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable due to increased sales during each of the periods and increases in inventories due to both increased sales and the higher value added components of the company s products 
these increased uses of capital were offset in part during fiscal by the company s net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities resulted from the company s net income  offset slightly by the combined net increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities resulted from the company s net income  enhanced slightly by the company s efforts to minimize accounts receivable and inventories 
in fiscal  and  the company s investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  including  in fiscal  acquisitions of the net assets of megabyte and invincible made in connection with the company s acquisitions of each of those companies 
property and equipment expenditures totaled   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and the first half of fiscal  the company borrowed and repaid funds periodically under its line of credit to finance its growth and operations 
during fiscal  the company increased its line of credit  net of repayments  by million  while in fiscal  the company reduced its borrowings by million after completing its initial public offering 
during the first half of fiscal  the company continued its periodic use of funds under its credit line 
in late december  the company completed its initial public offering of million shares of common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
after completing the public offering  the company paid off the amounts owed under its line of credit see below  and during fiscal  invested the remaining net proceeds in various investment grade commercial papers with maturities of less than days and realized approximately  in interest income 
in november  the company instituted a revolving line of credit with finova capital corporation finova 
the facility was amended in july to provide the company with up to million in working capital loans  based upon the company s accounts receivable and inventory levels 
the line of credit accrues certain commitment fees  unused facility fees and interest on outstanding amounts at the lender s prime rate at july  plus 
finova also makes available to the company various flooring commitments pursuant to which the company may finance the purchase of up to million in inventory less any amounts outstanding in working capital loans from certain of the company s vendors who have credit arrangements with finova 
as of july   there was no balance outstanding under the credit facility  and million outstanding under the flooring arrangements included in accounts payable 
the agreement governing the credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants including the maintenance of working capital of at least  minimum levels of tangible net worth and minimum levels of liquidity 
as of july   the company was in compliance with the covenants of the finova line of credit 
the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the initial term of the line of credit expires on november   but automatically renews for successive one year periods unless terminated by either party within a specified period in advance of the automatic renewal date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the finova line of credit  megabyte has two lines of credit  utilized primarily for overdraft and short term cash needs  with two german banks 
the lines allow megabyte to borrow up to  german marks approximately  us dollars  with interest at approximately  and is not guaranteed by procom 
at july   there was  dm approximately  us dollars outstanding under one of the lines  and outstanding on the second 
subsequent to july   the company s board of directors approved a stock open market repurchase program 
pursuant to the program  the company is authorized to effect repurchases of up to million in shares of its common stock 
the company expects that it will make such repurchases from time to time  when it determines that such repurchases are the best available use of the company s available cash  given the price of the company s stock and the interest income the company would otherwise earn on the company s available cash 
the company has recently signed a letter of intent with the irvine company to purchase an acre parcel of land in irvine  california  where it will develop a corporate headquarters facility  which the company expects will be ready for occupancy in the year the cost of the land  together with the currently estimated cost to construct the facility  would approximate million 
the company is considering various development and financing options  and believes that it will have the capital resources available to it to finance and complete the building during the next two years 
at july   the company had cash and marketable securities totalling million and additional availability under its unused line of credit 
the company believes that the cash proceeds from its initial public offering  together with existing cash balances and available credit under its existing line of credit  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
as of july  the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures except for the letter of intent to develop a corporate headquarters 
the company will continue to acquire fixed assets and make expenditures to support its growth 
in addition  in fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions utilizing its own cash and common stock 
the company has made cash advances to continue the operations of the entities acquired during fiscal of approximately million 
the company has had discussions concerning potential acquisitions with various businesses which have or offer products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company 
the company may acquire additional businesses in the future 
there can be no assurance that any such potential acquisitions could or will be completed 
in the event the company s plans  including the development of the corporate headquarters or the funds expended in the stock buyback program  require more capital than is presently anticipated  the company s remaining cash balances may be consumed and additional sources of liquidity such as debt or equity financings may be required to meet working capital needs 
there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by the company will not be required nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time or times as required by the company 
acquisitions during fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions 
in february  the company purchased of the outstanding shares of megabyte  a german distributor of high end networking solutions 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and was effected by the company s issuance of  shares of the company s common stock valued at  the company recorded the assets and liabilities of megabyte at their fair values on the date of acquisition 
the purchase price in excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately  which has been recorded as goodwill  and will be expensed on a straight line basis over years 
in june  the company completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and liabilities of invincible  a massachusetts based developer and reseller of high capacity  fault tolerant network storage solutions 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
the purchase price paid consisted of cash of approximately million  and the company assumed liabilities in excess of net assets acquired of approximately million  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
invincible had experienced significant losses in its fiscal year ended march  the company employed an appraiser to identify the values of the assets acquired  including  among other assets  certain in process research and development costs 
the company has determined that  among other assets  million of the purchase price was related to invincible s research and development efforts which had not attained technological feasibility  and for which no alternative future use was expected 
accordingly  the company has expensed the value of the research and development as of the date of the acquisition of invincible and has capitalized the fair value of the other assets acquired as determined by the appraiser  including the value of invincible s assembled work force and goodwill of approximately  which will be expensed on a straight line basis over years 
the company will include the results of operations and balance sheets of megabyte and invincible for periods subsequent to the date of the respective acquisitions 
prior periods have not been restated 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by the company for its fiscal adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
also in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
and changes the way public companies report segment information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by the company for its fiscal which commenced july  adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
year preparedness information the year issue is the result of computer programs  microprocessors  and embedded date reliant systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if such programs are not corrected  date data concerning the year could cause many systems to fail  lock up or generate erroneous results 
the company considers a product to be year compliant if the product s performance and functionality are unaffected by processing of dates prior to  during and after the year  but only if all products for example hardware  software and firmware used with the product properly exchange accurate date data with it 
the company believes that as data storage devices  its hard drive products are transparent to year requirements  and rely primarily on software found in operating systems and applications to function properly 
after significant testing  the company believes its current hard drive and cd rom products are year compliant  although other products previously sold by the company may not be year compliant 
in september  the company began to offer a limited year warranty on products sold by the company after that date 
previous to september  the company did not offer any such warranty on any of its products 
the company anticipates that litigation may be brought against vendors  including the company  of all component products of systems that are unable to properly manage data related to the year the company s agreements with customers and end users  both for products sold before and after september  typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s liability for such claims 
it is possible  however  that these measures will not provide protection from liability claims  as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
any such claims  with or without merit  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  customer satisfaction issues and potential lawsuits 
the company is identifying year dependencies in its primary accounting software  and other systems  equipment  and processes and is implementing changes to such systems  updating or replacing such equipment  and modifying such processes to make them year compliant 
the company is now assessing its internal year issues and is in the process of remediation of the critical systems 
while the company s current accounting software systems appear to be year compliant  the company intends to upgrade those systems during fiscal  and will insure that year compliance is a major factor in the selection of the appropriate accounting software package 
the company has also initiated formal communications with many of its significant suppliers and  in the near future  financial institutions to evaluate their year compliance plans and state of readiness and to determine whether any year issues will impede the ability of such suppliers to continue to provide goods and services to the company 
as a general matter  the company is vulnerable to any failure by its key suppliers to remedy their own year issues  which could delay shipments of essential components  thereby disrupting or halting the company s manufacturing operations 
further  the company also relies  both domestically and internationally  upon governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that such suppliers  governmental agencies  financial institutions  or other third parties will not suffer business disruption caused by a year issue  and there is little practical opportunity for the company to test or require year compliance from many of those large agencies  companies or providers 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company is in the process of communicating with its large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company anticipates that its internal systems  equipment and processes will be substantially year compliant by the end of june a formal budget has not been established  and the cost to the company of achieving year compliance is evolving  however  such cost is not currently expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
while the company currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant internal operational problems  delays in the company s remediation efforts  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the systems  equipment or processes of the company or its vendors  customers or financial institutions could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the manufacture  delivery or sale of products 
therefore  the company is considering the development of contingency plans along with its remediation efforts for continuing operations in the event such problems arise 
risk factors affecting the company and or its industries the company s business is subject to a number of risks  trends and uncertainties  some of which are related to the cd rom server  hard drive and raid industries in general and others related more specifically to the company 
as a result of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other risks presented elsewhere in this report  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be as successful as it was in the past few years or maintain its current market position 
some of these factors have affected the company s operating results in the past  and all of these factors could affect its future operating results 
the company does not expect that the percentage increases in revenues  operating income and net income during the past few years represent a consistent reliable trend that can be expected to continue in the future because  among other reasons  the industries in which the company competes are very competitive  challenging and cyclical 
potential fluctuations in results of operations the company s results of operations have in the past varied significantly and are likely in the future to vary significantly as a result of a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the volume and timing of orders received during the period  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  product line maturation  the impact of price competition on the company s average selling prices  the availability and pricing of components for the company s products  changes in distribution channel mix and product returns or price protection charges from customers 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
although the company has experienced growth in sales in recent periods  there can be no assurance that the company will experience growth in the future or be profitable on an operating basis in any future period 
in addition  due to the short product life cycles that characterize the company s markets  a significant percentage of the company s sales each quarter may result from new products or product enhancements introduced in that quarter 
since the company relies on new products and product enhancements for a significant percentage of sales  failure to continue to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements or failure of these products or product enhancements to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also has historically capitalized on short term market opportunities for volume purchases of certain components at favorable prices 
for example  in the quarter ended july   the company capitalized on a one time opportunity to sell a significant volume of high capacity disk drive upgrade products purchased at below market prices in the prior quarter  which resulted in a price advantage to the company that enhanced the company s sales and results of operations for that quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to capitalize on such opportunities in the future 
in addition  the company s fiscal second quarter sales have historically remained relatively flat due primarily to heavy reseller participation in trade shows that detract from reseller selling efforts  end user budget constraints that restrict end user purchases  and a higher than average number of holidays during that quarter 
the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter are difficult to forecast 
customers generally order on an as needed basis and  accordingly  the company historically has operated with a relatively small backlog 
notwithstanding the difficulty in forecasting future sales and the relatively small level of backlog at any given time  the company generally must plan production  order components and undertake its development  sales and marketing activities and other commitments months in advance 
accordingly  any shortfall in sales in a given quarter may disproportionately affect the company s results of operations due to relatively fixed short term expenses 
due to the foregoing factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
further  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s net sales or results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
historically  the company s gross margins have experienced significant volatility 
the company s gross margins vary significantly by product line  and  therefore  the company s overall gross margin varies with the mix of products sold by the company 
the company s markets are also characterized by intense competition and declining average unit selling prices over the course of the relatively short life cycles of individual products  which have often ranged from six to twelve months 
in addition  the company s gross margins may be adversely affected by availability and price increases associated with key products and components from the company s suppliers  some of which have been in short supply  and inventory obsolescence resulting from older generation products or the unexpected discontinuance of third party components 
finally  the company s gross margins may vary with the mix of its distribution channels and general economic conditions 
accordingly  the company s margins may decline in the future from the levels experienced in recent quarters 
see risk factors component shortages  reliance on sole or limited source suppliers and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
substantial competition the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive 
in each of its primary product lines  the company competes with a large number of disk drive manufacturers  computer resellers  vars and distributors 
some of the company s vendors also sell competing products to distributors  which then sell these products to the company s customers 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater market presence  name recognition and financial and technical resources than the company  and many have longstanding positions and established brand names in their respective markets 
in addition  certain of the company s current and potential competitors possess competitive cost advantages due to a number of factors  including lower taxes and substantially lower costs of labor associated with international operations 
finally  manufacturers of disk drives such as seagate technology  inc  ibm  quantum corporation and western digital corporation  and manufacturers of cd rom drives  such as toshiba america information systems  inc toshiba  nec corporation and plextor corporation  may in the future become more direct competitors of the company to the extent that such manufacturers elect to expand into the disk drive upgrade market or the cd server and array market 
the company s primary competitors in the cd server and array market consist of i cd array manufacturers such as microtest inc  meridian data  inc 
and micro design  inc  which also furnish cd rom management software with their cd array products  ii a number of hardware aggregators  computer resellers and vars that sell cd server products directly to end users and iii various cd server and array manufacturers 
the company s primary competitors in the disk drive upgrade market are i computer manufacturers that also market and sell storage upgrades  such as ibm  compaq computer corporation  compaq and hewlett packard company hewlett packard  ii companies that specialize in reselling replacement or increased capacity storage disk drives  such as storage dimensions inc or ameriquest technologies inc and iii various national distributors of third party upgrade drives such as ingram micro inc  merisel inc 
and tech data corporation 
the company s primary competitors in the raid product market are i computer manufacturers  such as ibm  compaq and hewlett packard  which generally focus on providing storage upgrades for their products and ii companies that sell storage solutions directly to end users  such as emc corporation and storage technology corporation 
these direct sales competitors historically have focused their efforts on sales of high capacity storage products in the mainframe and minicomputer environments 
in addition  the company competes with many smaller enterprises that provide and sell unique solutions to various computer users 
the company s success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to develop products that incorporate new and rapidly evolving technologies to provide network users cost effective data storage and information access solutions 
however  to the extent that disk drive storage or information access products become more of a commodity  price competition among both computer manufacturers and suppliers of disk drives and cd rom drives may result in the availability of such storage and access at a low cost 
these factors could create increased competition for the company s products  which could cause the company to experience reduced gross profit margins on its products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the company s markets are product reliability  price value relationship  product features and performance  brand name recognition  trade periodical reviews  time to market with new features and products  industry relationships  ease of installation and use  the quality of distribution channels  product quality  technical support and customer service 
see business competition 
rapid technological change  short product life cycles the market for the company s products is characterized by frequent new product introductions and rapid product obsolescence 
these factors typically result in short product life cycles  which have often ranged from six to twelve months 
for example  the data transfer rate of cd rom products has increased rapidly  resulting in the introduction of four  eight  ten and twelve speed cd roms 
similar technological advances have been made with regard to disk drive storage capabilities and other performance standards 
each new product cycle presents new opportunities for current or prospective competitors of the company to gain market share 
the company must continually monitor industry trends in selecting new technologies and features to incorporate into its products 
if the company is unable to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis  the company s sales could be adversely affected 
any such failure also could impair the company s brand name and the company s ability to command the attention and loyalty of computer resellers  vars and distributors in future periods 
moreover  because short product life cycles are accompanied by long lead times for many components of the company s products  the company may be unable to reduce or increase production in response to unexpected demand 
the company s ability to introduce new products in a timely manner is heavily dependent on its ability to develop or purchase firmware and software drivers for its cd rom and disk drive products 
while the company endeavors to work with its component suppliers to plan for the timing of introduction of new components and to develop the associated firmware and software  unforeseen design issues or other factors that delay introduction of these products could adversely affect the company s ability to ship new products 
in addition  third party suppliers may not employ adequate testing and quality assurance procedures  resulting in the receipt by the company of defective components 
this could require the company to find replacement components or wait for the resolution of the problem  either of which could delay the company s ability to bring products to market and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business also will be adversely affected if new disk drives  cd rom drives or other components that it selects from among those offered by its various vendors do not perform favorably on a cost or performance basis compared to competing products 
in addition  products and technologies developed by competitors may render the company s products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
finally  advances in network and on line technology and development of new  higher capacity storage media such as digital video disc dvd may result in a reduction or replacement of cd rom as a data storage and information access medium 
if the company is unable to adapt to these and other technological advances by developing new products  the company s financial performance would be materially adversely affected 
see business research and development 
the company has historically experienced steep declines in sales  prices and gross profit toward the end of the life cycles of most of its products  the precise timing of which is difficult to predict 
historically  as the company has planned and implemented new products  it has experienced unexpected reductions in sales and gross profit of older generation products as customers have anticipated new products 
these reductions have in the past given and could continue to give rise to charges for obsolete or excess inventory  returns of older generation products by computer resellers  vars and distributors or substantial price protection charges 
see customer concentration  distribution strategy risks  inventory protection 
for example  in fiscal  the company incurred losses when it discontinued sales of cd rom multimedia kits to mass merchants and distributors 
from time to time  the company has experienced and may in the future experience inventory obsolescence resulting from the unexpected discontinuance of third party components  such as disk drives  included in the company s products 
to the extent the company is unsuccessful in managing product transitions  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on cd servers and arrays and notebook upgrades sales of cd servers and arrays  including individual cd rom drives  recordable cd roms  modules and other related components accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the widespread use of cd rom as a data storage and information access medium is relatively recent  and there can be no assurance that another technology will not replace cd rom as a widely accepted data storage and information access medium  or that there will be widespread acceptance or continuing growth of cd servers and arrays in general  or of the company s cd servers and arrays in particular 
indeed  the company has seen a reduction in the demand for cd servers and arrays  primarily  the company believes  due to the growth of internet and intranet information distribution solutions 
in addition  if on line services such as westlaw and lexis nexis become more cost effective and develop user friendly methods of accessing information  they may have an adverse impact on the use of cd rom as an information storage medium 
furthermore  the successful development and marketing of dvd would enable end users to store significantly more data than currently stored on a cd used with the company s products 
accordingly  even if the company were able to adapt its products to incorporate dvd technology  the number of servers and arrays required by end users may decline compared to current levels 
finally  even if the cd server and array market continues to grow  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its market share or its gross margins in that market 
the company currently incorporates software with many of its cd servers and arrays  which allows a network to manage effectively direct access to information contained on cd roms by network users 
the company ships cd servers and arrays both with cd rom network data access management software from third party vendors and with recently introduced  internally developed cd rom network data access management software 
the company s internally developed software is not presently available on all major hardware platforms  and of the company s cd servers and arrays shipped to date that contain cd rom network data access management software  substantially all included third party software 
in addition  the company historically has focused its efforts on hardware development and does not have substantial experience in the development  testing and marketing of cd rom network data access management software 
given the high percentage of the company s sales that are derived from cd servers and arrays  the failure to secure from a third party effective cd rom network data access management software  or the failure of the company to continue the development and marketing of its internally developed software  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business products and technology 
in addition to the company s reliance on cd servers arrays  the company also has relied rather heavily on sales of notebook upgrade disk drive subsystems 
the company believes that with the growth of the notebook computer market worldwide  many end users will opt to upgrade their storage systems as they either become too slow  or too limited  given the number of rather storage intensive programs that exist today 
during the fiscal year ended july   sales of notebook computer upgrade subsystems comprised approximately of the company s net sales  and such sales have generally been in excess of the company s average gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the current sales and gross profit rate  as competitors and computer manufacturers decide whether to enter the market  thereby certainly causing pricing pressure on such products 
component shortages  reliance on sole or limited source suppliers the company depends on sole or limited source suppliers for certain key components used in its products  particularly disk and cd rom drives 
in recent years  these components have been in short supply and frequently on allocation by manufacturers  and the company s size may place it at a competitive disadvantage during such periods relative to larger competitors 
although the company maintains ongoing efforts to obtain adequate supplies of components  there can be no assurances that the company will obtain adequate supplies or obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect the company s gross margins 
the company has no guaranteed supply arrangements with any of its sole or limited source suppliers and customarily purchases sole or limited source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
moreover  the company s suppliers may  from time to time  experience production shortfalls or interruptions that impair the supply of components to the company 
component shortages are likely to continue  and there can be no assurance that such shortages will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  in its attempt to counter actual or perceived component shortages  the company may overpurchase certain components  resulting in excess inventory and reducing the company s liquidity or  in the event of inventory obsolescence or a decline in the market value of such inventory  causing inventory write offs that could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see rapid technological change  short product life cycles 
the company relies on a small number of suppliers to continue to develop  introduce and manufacture disk drives  cd rom drives and other components that incorporate new technologies and features that compete favorably in functionality and price with the offerings of other disk drive and cd rom manufacturers  including competitors of the company 
the company s dependence on these sole or limited source suppliers  and the risks associated with any delay or shortfall in supply  are exacerbated by the short life cycles that characterize the company s products 
any delay in the introduction by or availability of disk drives or cd rom drives from the company s suppliers or the failure of such suppliers to provide functionality and performance on a cost effective basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  it is possible that the technology of the components the company uses in manufacturing its products will be rendered undesirable or obsolete by the components of other suppliers 
the company would then be forced to establish relationships with new suppliers  which could delay or preclude the company from bringing competitive products to market and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also relies on a network of independent subcontractors to supply certain custom components manufactured to the company s specifications 
this network consists of a number of small firms with limited financial resources 
while the company utilizes several firms to mitigate the risk of business interruption  it is possible that several vendors could simultaneously experience problems with production or financial stability  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

customer concentration  distribution strategy risks  inventory protection the company sells its products primarily to a domestic and international network of computer resellers  vars and distributors  and the company s success depends on the continued viability and financial stability of its customer base 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has increased its reliance on sales to large hardware aggregators  computer resellers and vars including large corporate consultants while reducing its use of mass merchants 
during fiscal and fiscal  one customer accounted for approximately and of net sales  respectively  while three customers accounted for approximately and of the company s total accounts receivable on july  and july   respectively 
if the company were to experience difficulty in continuing to sell to these customers  or collecting these accounts receivable  due to the failure of any of these customers or otherwise  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a loss of either or both of these customers could materially and adversely affect the company s net sales 
the company must continually develop and maintain relationships with its key computer resellers  vars and distributors 
due to the rapid changes in the computer industry and the methods by which end users purchase computer products  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and maintaining an effective distribution system 
the computer distribution and computer retail industries historically have been characterized by rapid change  including periods of widespread financial difficulties and consolidation and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
the loss of  or reduction in sales to  the company s key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s computer resellers  vars and distributors generally offer products of several different companies  including products competitive with the company s products 
accordingly  there is a risk that these computer resellers  vars and distributors may give higher priority to products of other suppliers and may reduce their efforts to sell the company s products 
although since fiscal the company has relied on computer resellers and vars as its primary domestic sales channels  the company entered into agreements with tech data corporation and ingram micro  inc  computer products distributors  to sell the company s products nationally 
an increased use of distributors to sell the company s products  whether domestically or through increased international sales which are generally made through distributors  could adversely affect the company s gross margins as sales to distributors are typically made at slightly lower average prices  and often require additional post sale marketing and support  than sales to computer resellers and vars 
the company frequently grants limited rights to customers to return products purchased from the company  in some cases in exchange for new purchases  and also provides price protection to its customers 
the short product life cycles of the company s products and the difficulty in predicting future sales increase the risk that new product introductions  price reductions by the company or its competitors or other factors affecting the markets for the company s products could result in significant product returns 
in addition  new product introductions by the company s suppliers or its competitors  or other market factors  may require the company to reduce prices in a manner or at a time that gives rise to significant price protection charges 
the company estimates product returns and potential price protection charges based on historical experience and accrues reserves therefor 
however  these accruals may prove to be insufficient  and unanticipated future returns and price protection charges could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly in light of the rapid product obsolescence that often occurs during product transitions

intellectual property rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trade secret protections and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights 
the company has no patent protection for its current product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company s measures to protect its intellectual property rights will deter or prevent unauthorized use of the company s technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company s inability to protect its proprietary rights in the united states or internationally may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims by third parties that the company s current or future products  procedures or processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not normally perform any formal surveys or studies relating to whether its products or processes infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  and it would be difficult to establish whether a given product or process infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
any future litigation  regardless of outcome  may result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of the efforts of the company s management and technical personnel 
an adverse determination in any such litigation may subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from such parties  if licenses to such rights could be obtained  or require the company to cease using such technology 
there can be no assurance that if such licenses were obtainable  they would be obtainable at costs reasonable to the company 
if forced to cease using such technology  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to develop or obtain alternate technology 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  changes in patent or copyright laws or failure of the company to obtain necessary licenses may prevent the company from manufacturing  using or selling certain of its products or processes  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in may  compaq made certain infringement and other claims against the company and obtained an injunction prohibiting the company s use of a small string of software code contained in certain of the company s disk drive products 
although the company has rewritten the infringing code and settled the lawsuit  the lawsuit required substantial management time  significant expenditures for legal fees and costs and a one time settlement payment and ongoing royalty payments to compaq for these products

management of change in recent years  the company has expanded the overall size of its business and scope of its operations  including research and development  marketing  technical support and sales and distribution 
the company increased its number of employees from at the beginning of fiscal to at the end of fiscal  and has also recently increased the breadth of its cd server and array product line and its network attached storage products development team  enlarged the scope of its international operations and increased its marketing and product development expenditures 
the expansion of the company s business and product lines has required significant investments in infrastructure and systems 
managing this change has presented numerous challenges  including hiring and retaining key employees  integrating or changing management information systems and coordinating suppliers 
in addition  the company has recently opened a sales and support office in new york  and currently intends to open and staff additional field sales and support offices 
in addition  the company has completed two acquisitions during fiscal each of these acquisitions present special opportunities and pose risks of not only managing change  but also the implementation and coordination of companywide strategies to manage the company s human and capital resources 
the company s future success will depend in large measure on its ability to implement sufficient operating  manufacturing and financial procedures and controls successfully  to improve coordination among different operating functions  to strengthen management information and telecommunications systems and to continue to hire qualified personnel in all areas  and to integrate the operations and personnel of the two existing  and any potential  acquisitions successfully 
the company s management has not had previous experience in integrating acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that the company will properly manage the acquisitions  or these other activities and implement these additional systems and controls successfully  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of international sales and operations the company s international sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  the company added independent sales representatives in canada and france  in fiscal  in dubai  and it plans to add additional foreign sales representatives in the future 
for fiscal  the company acquired the operations of megabyte  which sells its products primarily to german  european and middle eastern customers 
as a result  the company saw the percentage of products sold to international customers increase significantly for fiscal compared to fiscal and the company s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including export regulations  government imposed restrictions on the purchase of technological equipment  import and export duties and restrictions  the logistical difficulties of managing multinational operations  potentially adverse tax consequences and lower gross margins associated with the increased proportion of international sales made to distributors 
while the majority of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars megabyte sales are denominated in german marks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to end users in a particular country  leading to a reduction of sales in that country 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations create risks of exchange rate losses  and the assets of the company in germany could be devalued with little or no notice to the company 
the company may also experience competition specific to a given local market 
in addition  the company s business may be adversely affected by seasonal sales declines in europe  which typically occur during the summer months 
because the company has operations in different countries  the company s management must address the difficulty of merging geographically disparate operations as well as differences in regulatory environments  cultures and time zones 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business sales and marketing 
warranty exposure the company s primary warranty efforts consist of accepting defective products from customers and either repairing them or returning the defective component to the original manufacturer for repair or replacement during the applicable warranty period 
in the past  the company has had return rates of its products ranging from  and in fiscal  the company experienced return rates of approximately 
the company generally protects itself by extending to its customers a warranty that corresponds to the warranty provided to the company by its suppliers 
however  if a supplier were to fail to meet its warranty obligations  the company would be forced to assume responsibility for warranties on all components manufactured by that supplier 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business sales and marketing 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
in particular  the company relies on the services of its four founders  messrs 
razmjoo  alaghband  aydin and shahrestany the founders 
the loss of any of these individuals or other management or technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  including the ability to establish and strengthen strategic relationships  its ability to open new offices successfully  its ability to adapt its products to changes in technology and its ability to attract and retain technical personnel and other employees  the competition for which is intense 
the company maintains employment agreements with each of the founders  but does not maintain key person life insurance policies on the lives of these individuals

future capital requirements the company s business plan will require significant amounts of working capital 
while the company has funded its growth historically through working capital loans and internally generated funds  there can be no assurance that the proceeds of the company s december public offering  together with available cash  bank lines of credit and cash from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements 
if additional funds are required  the company s operations may need to be significantly curtailed or the company could be forced to obtain financing on terms that cause the company s business  financial condition and results of operations to be materially adversely affected 
future acquisitions the company may expand its product lines through the acquisition of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the ability to manage geographically remote units  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering markets in which the company has little or no experience or expertise and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired companies 
in addition  acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds 
the company s management has only recent experience in managing acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition would result in long term benefits to the company or that management would be able to effectively manage the acquired business

facilities as noted above in facilities and legal proceedings  the landlord of the company s primary facility in irvine  california alleges that the lease on that facility was not properly extended by the company  and has sued the company in an effort to require the company to vacate the premises prior to november  the company and the landlord are currently engaged in discussions to extend the lease for one or two months and to settle the action  and the company has recently executed a lease proposal for a facility in santa ana  california 
if the company is required to vacate the irvine facility before suitable alternative facilities are available for the company  the operations of the company conducted in irvine  including manufacturing  marketing  sales and corporate administration  would be seriously interrupted and this interruption would have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in any event  the company expects that it will incur significant relocation expenses during the first six months of fiscal and increased rental expenses on its new facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income the company can earn on its investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
foreign currency exchange risk the company transacts business in various foreign countries  but only has significant assets deployed outside the united states in germany 
the company has effected intercompany advances and sold goods to megabyte denominated in us dollars  and those amounts are subject to currency fluctuation  and require constant revaluation on the company s financial statements 
the company does not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the german mark compared to the us dollar 
if such a change did occur  the company s would have to take into account a currency exchange gain or loss in the amount of the change in the us dollar denominated balance of the amounts outstanding at the time of such change 
while the company does not believe such a gain loss is likely  and would not likely be material  there can be no assurance that such a loss would not have an adverse material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition
