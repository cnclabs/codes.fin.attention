item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company commenced operations in during the past years  the company has designed  manufactured and marketed high power  solid state  rf and microwave power amplifiers and related subsystems for military  medical  satellite and  most recently  wireless telecommunications applications 
the company historically has been dependent upon the military market as its principal source of revenue 
in  as the military market was declining  the company increased the scope of its business and entered commercial markets  thereby broadening its product offerings 
the company now develops precision high power amplifiers for a variety of commercial uses

the company derives its revenues principally from the sale of solid state  rf and microwave  power amplifiers and from the sale of radar environmental and electronic warfare simulators 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this sales increase was primarily due to higher shipments of the company s commercial products  partially offset by slightly lower shipments of the company s military products 
sales of commercial products increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the commercial sales increase was predominantly due to higher shipments to one domestic wireless telecommunications oem and one satellite communications oem  partially offset by lower shipments to one foreign wireless telecommunications oem 
sales of military products decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the military sales decrease was predominantly due to an overall lower market demand for republic products 
international sales decreased by to million in from million in  totaling of net sales in compared to in the decrease in international sales was primarily due to lower foreign wireless telecommunications oem business  partially offset by higher foreign military business 
in  sales to two domestic commercial oems customer b and customer d and a foreign commercial oem customer a accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  sales to a foreign commercial oem customer a and a domestic commercial oem customer b accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
gross profit 
the company s cost of sales consists principally of direct labor  labor overhead  direct material  material overhead  other direct costs and work in process inventory changes from the beginning to the end of a period 
gross profit increased by to million in from million in the company s gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to the non recurrence of the million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory caused by then diminished demand for those particular products  the million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory related to the cancellation of the remainder of the airnet contract and the million write off of wireless single channel work in process inventory caused by a domestic commercial oem s decision to internally manufacture amplifiers for the production portion of the pcs tdma program 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the non recurrence of the above mentioned items plus the recognition of a more favorable gross profit associated with the net sales increase in in addition  the following factors adversely affected the company s gross profit margin i low gross profits the company is experiencing on three military oem contracts the result of production delays  technical problems and software integration difficulties  ii the overall low gross profit margin obtainable on the company s multi channel product line the result of competitive pricing pressures  iii engineering and manufacturing difficulties experienced on the pre production phase of two newer wireless products and iv a high level of warranty expense as a percentage of net sales specifically related to those warranty costs associated with the company s more recent introduction of wireless telecommunications products 
certain of the company s inventory costing techniques involve developing a standard cost which estimates the average  or standard  cost per unit over the extended life cycle of a product 
such costs include labor  material  other direct costs and related overheads 
if the extended life cycle of a product does not materialize or if there is no reasonable certainty that product maturation will take place within the near future  write offs of work in process inventory would be required 
such write offs could materially adversely affect the company s gross profit and results of operations 
certain of the purchase orders or contracts comprising backlog at december  set forth product specifications not yet achieved by the company that would require the company to complete additional product development 
failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to the cancellation of the related purchase orders or contracts 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or contracts from one or more significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurances that gross profit will continue to improve 
if the company is not able to reduce its production costs to the extent anticipated  or to introduce new products with greater margins  and if average selling prices decline beyond current expectations  the company s gross profit and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s gross profit may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including the mix of systems and equipment sold  production  reliability or quality problems  and price competition 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and other expenses for management  finance  accounting  contracts and human resources as well as legal and other professional services 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the company wide upgrade of computer hardware  software and data processing equipment that portion of which did not meet the company s capitalization criteria as well as higher accounting and legal expenses 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist principally of salaries and other expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and trade shows 
selling expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in selling expenses resulted primarily from higher bid and proposal expenses incurred in connection with a million foreign military order awarded in the third quarter of and a generally higher level of proposal activity across all product lines 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist principally of direct labor  labor overhead  direct material  material overhead and other direct costs associated with product development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the decrease in research and development expenses resulted primarily from reduced military and  to a lesser extent  wireless telecommunications product development efforts 
military research and development expenses decreased predominantly as a result of the company completing the majority of the product development efforts  in  for a republic mres simulator product 
in the military environment  customer funding of product development costs is typical 
the republic mres program was an exception  however  as the company funded a large majority of this product development effort throughout the company believes that the continued introduction of new products is essential to its competitiveness  especially in the wireless telecommunications market  and is committed to continued investment in research and development 
the company views the decrease in wireless telecommunications research and development expenses the majority of which occurred in the first quarter of as a short term solution used to assist in reducing costs to match corresponding reduced wireless revenue which also occurred in the first quarter of 
fundamental to this effort was a temporary reallocation of some of the company s engineering and technology resources to either revenue producing or customer funded product development during the first quarter of this action enabled the company to leverage its other commercial and military product lines while insuring a continued and focused emphasis on critical wireless telecommunications development projects 
interest expense 
interest expense consists principally of interest expended on the company s credit facility  idrbs and promissory notes  partially offset by interest earned on the company s cash balances 
interest expense increased by to million in from million in  primarily reflecting increased average borrowings under the company s credit facility

 accounting for income taxes 
the company has recorded deferred tax assets of million in and million in for the benefit of federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards nols and timing differences generated in those years 
the company has reserved a portion of the deferred tax asset with respect to its nols 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the nols 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to in from in the rate was favorably impacted by the partial recovery of the previously reserved deferred tax asset resulting from the company s improved profitability position as compared to without the benefit of this change in the reserve  the effective tax rate for would have been 
the company will continue to assess the reserved deferred tax asset each reporting quarter 
the rate was due to the net loss incurred by the company in  the benefit of which the company expects to utilize to offset future taxable income  as prescribed by sfas no 
there can be no assurances that the company will continue to achieve taxable income in the future 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this sales increase was primarily due to higher shipments of the company s commercial products and  to a lesser extent  higher shipments of the company s military products 
sales of commercial products increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the commercial sales increase was predominantly due to higher shipments to two wireless telecommunications oems and one satellite communications oem 
sales of military products increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales in such years 
the military sales increase was predominantly due to greater market demand for one republic product  initial hardware shipments for another republic product and an overall modest resurgence of shipments to us prime contractors for various military products 
international sales increased by to million in from million in  totaling of net sales in compared to in the increase in international sales was primarily due to higher foreign wireless telecommunications oem business and  to a lesser extent  higher foreign military business 
in  sales to a foreign commercial oem customer a and a domestic commercial oem customer b accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  sales to one foreign commercial oem customer a and two domestic commercial oems customer b and customer c accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million in from million in the company s gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to a million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory caused by then diminished demand for those particular products  a million write off of wireless multi channel work in process inventory related to the cancellation of the remainder of the airnet contract and a million write off of wireless single channel work in process inventory caused by a domestic commercial oem s decision to internally manufacture amplifiers for the production portion of the pcs tdma program 
in addition  the company s gross profit margin was adversely affected by the overall low gross profit margin obtainable on cellular cdma multi channel amplifiers due to competitive pricing pressure  low gross profit margins experienced on a number of military oem contracts due to various production delays  low gross profit margins experienced on various other commercial oem contracts due in part to a number of engineering and manufacturing difficulties  and higher commercial warranty expenses as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of greater costs associated with being a public company  for a full year 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to the overall sales volume growth in as compared to selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
the increase in selling expenses resulted primarily from higher sales representative commissions and higher accrued warranty expenses  partially offset by lower bid and proposal expenses and lower sales incentive expenses 
the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to the overall sales volume growth in as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of net sales 
this increase resulted primarily from higher wireless telecommunications product development and  to a lesser extent  higher military product development 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by to million in from million in  primarily reflecting a loan repayment  in the latter part of  to the company s largest stockholder through the utilization of a portion of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering ipo 
in addition  interest expense included a one time charge of million for deferred financing costs as a result of the repayment of the debt outstanding at the time of the ipo and also included a million amendment fee expense  charged by fleet capital corporation  related to a restructuring of the company s credit facility to provide additional financing pending the completion of the ipo 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate remained relatively unchanged at in from in these rates are due to the net losses incurred by the company in both and  the benefit of which the company expects to utilize to offset future taxable income  as prescribed by sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources in the fourth quarter of  the company successfully completed its ipo  raising net proceeds to the company of approximately million from the company s sale of  shares of common stock  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
since the ipo  the company had financed its operations and met its capital requirements through the following two sources i a credit facility and or ii cash provided by operating activities 
the company has entered into a loan agreement with ibj schroder business credit corporation ibj which provides for a million credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit in the amount of million  a term loan in the amount of million and a million capital equipment capex loan facility 
the revolving line of credit and both the term loan and capex loan bear interest at annual rates equal to the prime rate plus and the prime rate plus  respectively 
the credit facility matures in february and automatically renews itself for one year periods thereafter  unless terminated by either the company or ibj 
aggregate borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited by a borrowing base  which is calculated as the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible raw materials and work in process inventories with borrowings based on aggregate eligible inventory limited to million 
the term loan requires a monthly principal payment of million 
the revolver increases each month commensurate with term loan repayments until a maximum revolving line of credit of million is reached 
the capex loan requires monthly principal payments that are recalculated each month based on the prior month s capex borrowings  if any  amortized over months 
capex loans borrowings must occur prior to february  the credit facility is subject to customary covenants  including  among other things  limitations with respect to incurring indebtedness  payment of dividends and affiliate advances  and a provision for maintaining a certain fixed charge coverage ratio 
operating activities provided net cash of million and used net cash of million in and  respectively 
from december  to december   accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable  accrued liabilities and customer advance payments increased by million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the higher revenue level in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of the increase in inventory was predominantly due to an increase in work in process inventory associated with three long term military programs and a build to forecast wireless telecommunication product and  to a lesser extent  an increase in component inventory associated with one of the long term military programs 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and customer advance payments was primarily due to the receipt of an advance payment in the fourth quarter of from a foreign military oem and  to a lesser extent  a greater year end payroll and related benefits accrual  partially offset by more current vendor payments when compared to year end investing activities  which consisted primarily of equipment acquisitions  used net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities  which consisted predominantly of net proceeds from the credit facility  provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures were funded primarily through cash provided by beginning of year cash balances  operating activities and the company s credit facility 
principal expenditures for included upgrades to the company s information systems hardware and software  purchases of engineering and manufacturing test equipment  upgrades to the company s cad systems and expanded surface mount capabilities 
the company expects that capital expenditures  anticipated to minimally include a second automated surface mount pick n place machine and additional engineering and manufacturing test equipment  will be financed by cash provided by operating activities  the company s credit facility and or third party financing sources 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million as of december  working capital as of december  included approximately million and million in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively  compared to december  working capital which included approximately million and million in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively 
the company s current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of december  was  compared with a current ratio of as of december  as of both december  and december   the company s debt to equity ratio was the company believes that cash generated from operations  amounts available under its credit facility  and or other third party financing will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and to provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not require additional financing prior to such date to fund its operations  and  if required  that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  the company may require additional financing after such date to fund its operations 
the majority of any year issues have already been addressed by the company 
in  the company s business and computing system was upgraded and is now year friendly 
the remaining efforts for the company  all of which are scheduled for  include a few personal computer applications and windows upgrades 
these efforts are not expected to cause a financial burden for the company
