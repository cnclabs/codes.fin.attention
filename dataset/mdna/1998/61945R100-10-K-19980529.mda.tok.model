results of operations vs 
revenues total revenues from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended february  fy were more than the  of revenues recorded for the year ended february  fy 
this increase represents the combination of a increase in sales generated by the jm ney company jm ney  and an increase of  of investment and other income over the net losses of  recorded in fy jm ney s increase in sales to  reflects growth in sales of contacts for sensors used in the automotive industry  and increased sales of precious metal materials  particularly materials for use in the manufacture of dental implant components 
such sales growth during fy is reflected net of a decline in sales to the company s former dental segment 
investment and other income totaled  for fy  versus a loss of  in fy  as follows s omitted fy fy net gains from domestic investment portfolio   net gains from russian and eastern european portfolio interest and dividends rental income gain from digital graphix loss from investments in phoenix shannon  other  net gains from the company s domestic investment portfolio increased due to a rebound in the market value of the company s investment in centennial cellular  which had experienced a decline in value in fy  and to continued growth in value from the company s portfolio of financial institutions 
all gains from this portion of the investment portfolio in each of the two most recent years represented increases in net unrealized appreciation of the underlying investments 
also  during fy  the company significantly expanded its investment activities in russia and eastern europe 
this resulted in the recording of net realized and unrealized gains of  net of valuation allowances of  established for the foreign trading portfolio  and  established for a russian security held for longer term investment 
such reserves were established to address volatility and liquidity concerns within these markets 
during fy  digital graphix  incorporated  an investment whose results had been consolidated with those of the company through april  sold its net assets and used the proceeds to repay notes  redeem its preferred stock  and issue liquidating dividends on its common stock 
as a result  the company received  in excess of the net carrying value of its investment 
during fy  the company wrote off  in the value of its investment in the common stock of  and a note receivable from  phoenix shannon  plc which had been received as part of the consideration for the sale of the net assets of the company s former dental segment in fy cost of sales cost of sales totaled  or of net sales in fy  versus cost of sales of  or of net sales in fy the decline in the gross margins from to was caused primarily by significant increases and volatility in the price of palladium which is used in the majority of jm ney s products  and by increases in materials sales as a percentage of overall sales 
however  gross margins of  in fy represented a increase over fy levels 
during most of fy  the price of palladium remained relatively stable between per troy ounce and per troy ounce  with an increase at fiscal year end to above per ounce 
such a market condition enabled jm ney to easily replace the metal it had sold with metal of approximately equal value for lifo accounting purposes 
however  during fy  the price of palladium fluctuated widely 
prices ranged from a low of per troy ounce to a high of per ounce 
during much of this period  the market viewed these price increases as temporary  as reflected in the lower cost for palladium in future months 
accordingly  for certain segments of its business  this price increase could not be immediately passed on to jm ney s customers 
although jm ney had certain hedging programs in place  such strategies did not cover all sales programs involving significant quantities of palladium 
during the first quarter of fy  the price of palladium has increased further 
jm ney has utilized expanded metals hedging  financing and purchasing programs to reduce the adverse exposure that this development may have on its results of operations 
in addition  the company s fy gross margin benefited from lower gold prices  which served to slightly offset the impact of the effects of the palladium price increases and volatility 
also  during fy  sales of precious metal materials  in the form of wire  strip  and rod represented approximately of sales  versus material sales of in fy material products generally have lower average gross margins  due to the commodity nature of the product  versus highly engineered parts and components  which involve an increased amount of value added processing  and higher gross margins 
such sales mix contributed further to the lower average gross margins during fy selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations totaled  or more than the costs incurred during fy costs of approximately  incurred in the process of upgrading jm ney s manufacturing system to be year compliant  an increase of  of recruiting costs  including personnel fees and advertising  and legal costs incurred in connection with the exchange of the company s debentures and change of the terms of its preferred stock all contributed to the growth in these expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from  or of sales in fy to  or of sales in fy while increased material sales served to lower the relative comparison  the absolute increase of reflects the cost of efforts to develop new proprietary alloys that have similar physical attributes to existing alloys with lower palladium content to reduce exposure to market fluctuations  and to work on new manufacturing processes which enable jm ney to offer product alternatives 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in fy to  in fy increased borrowings under jm ney s revolving line of credit to support both its working capital requirements and those of ney ultrasonics served to increase interest 
in addition  significant increases in the leasing rates of palladium and platinum also served to increase financing costs under its line of credit 
jm ney was not exposed to these volatile interest rates to the extent that many other companies using palladium were  thus this impact was contained 
also  during the year  jm ney closed on a million seven year subordinated note that bears interest at the annual rate of 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs for two months added to the interest expense total 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations totaled  for fy  versus a tax benefit from continuing operations of  for fy the current year expense included a net increase of  in deferred income taxes payable 
the effective tax rate for fy was favorably impacted by the settlement of audits of prior state income tax returns 
discontinued operations effective february   the company sold the net assets of ney ultrasonics for approximately million and additional contingent consideration 
net of expenses incurred in the transaction  the company recognized a gain of  net of tax 
for the year then ended  ney ultrasonics generated approximately  of net income on sales of  during fy these operations generated an increase in sales of over fy  which produced the first operating profit in its history 
the company is optimistic that continuation of the market penetration of the ultrasonic cleaning technology will result in increased future profits in the form of contingent consideration from the sale 
preferred dividends preferred dividends  including the amortization of issuance costs  totaled  during fy  which is a increase over the dividends of  accrued for fy the dividends per preferred share  which include a participating dividend based on the operating income of jm ney  including earnings relating to ney ultrasonics and the former dental segment  increased from approximately per share in fy to approximately in fy however  due to purchases of shares of preferred stock during both years  the aggregate preferred dividends increased by a lower amount 
reversals of previously accrued but unpaid dividends added  and  to income applicable to common shareholders in fy and fy  respectively 
as a result of the shareholder approval of the change in the terms of the preferred stock  dividends that had been accrued from may through november were paid in february net income as a result of the income of  generated from continuing operations  income of  from discontinued operations  and the gain of  on the sale of ney ultrasonics  total net income for fy was  versus net income of  in fy after net preferred dividends  income applicable to common shareholders for fy was  or 
per share basic  
diluted  versus income applicable to common shareholders of  or per basic and diluted share in fy vs 
revenues for the year ended february  fy  revenues from continuing operations totaled  which were more than revenues during the fiscal year ended february  fy 
this increase primarily reflects a increase in sales for the jm ney company jm ney  losses sustained from investments in phoenix shannon  plc  and the absence of sales from the company s former video products segment 
sales from jm ney were  during fy  versus fy sales of  sales growth was generated in automotive  medical and other industrial markets  which resulted from expansion of manufacturing capabilities and effective marketing efforts 
additional sales growth was generated from dental alloy fabrication services to the company s former dental segment  which during fy was included for only three months after the sale of that division to phoenix shannon 
sales from digital graphix  incorporated dgi  the company s formerly consolidated video products segment  totaled  during the first two months of fy due to an offering of dgi s common stock  the company s ownership was diluted and dgi s results beyond that date were not consolidated with those of the company 
accordingly  during fy  this segment did not generate any reported sales for the company 
investment and other income produced a net loss of  during fy  versus income of  in the prior fiscal year 
a significant decline in the market value of phoenix shannon common stock resulted in the complete write off of  of the company s investment in phoenix shannon  including a million note receivable

gains from common stocks  which primarily comprised investments in certain financial institutions  produced net investment gains of  during fy  while these investment activities yielded  of net gains during fy in addition  rental income increased from  in fy to  in fy  due primarily to a full year of revenue from the former dental segment  which has leased space in the company s  square foot office and manufacturing facility 
interest income of  in fy was lower than the  recorded in fy  due primarily to reduced interest related to the company s note receivable from dgi  which was partially offset by increased interest on excess cash balances 
the dgi note was partially converted to dgi s preferred stock during fy  and no accruals of dividend income were recorded 
in addition  fee income of  in fy added to the total of investment and other income 
cost of sales cost of sales of  in fy represented of sales  while such costs amounted to  or of sales during fy the increased gross margins  versus  represents the net of a increase in margins for jm ney  and the absence of higher margin sales from the video products segment  for which only modest sales were reported for fy selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  during fy were lower than the  of such expenses reported for fy a write down in fy of million of the company s investment in dgi  and approximately  of legal and settlement costs relating to a suit filed against a former subsidiary of the company accounted for most of the higher costs in fy selling  general and administrative expenses totaled of revenues in fy versus in fy research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from  in fy to  in fy due to the absence in fy of such expenses from dgi 
such expenses  excluding dgi  were  or of sales in fy  versus of sales for fy the relative increase reflects efforts at jm ney to develop new precious metal alloys  and product processes 
interest expense interest expense of  during fy represents a decrease from interest expense of  incurred during fy principal payments in both years on long term obligations  including prepayments made during fy to implement a capital stock purchase program  along with lower average outstanding amounts under revolving credit agreements  resulted in the lower interest expense in fy income tax benefit an income tax benefit of  relating to continuing operations was recorded in fy due to the  pre tax loss and to the favorable settlement of a state income tax audit relating to prior years which was the primary factor that enabled the company to reverse approximately  of accrued income taxes 
a tax benefit of  relating to  of losses from continuing operations was recorded in fy discontinued operations during fy  ney ultrasonics operations produced a net loss of  versus a net loss of  from this former segment in fy market acceptance of newly introduced ultrasonic cleaning technology improved its sales and operating results

a net gain of  or per share  was recorded in fy from the sale of the net assets of this segment to phoenix shannon 
this gain included  of a curtailment gain relating to jm ney s defined benefit pension plan 
part of the proceeds received from the sale of the dental segment included  shares of phoenix shannon s stock  which were valued at  and a million note receivable 
as noted  during fy and fy  the entire value of this portion of the consideration was completely written off 
phoenix shannon was subsequently placed into bankruptcy and its assets  including the former dental segment  were sold 
however  such proceeds were insufficient to enable the company to realize any value from either the note or the stock 
preferred dividends the preferred dividend requirement  including the amortization of the issuance discount  totaled  in fy versus  in fy the decrease reflects the combination of fewer outstanding preferred shares in fy versus fy due to share purchases in the fourth quarters of both fy and fy  and increased per share dividends 
due to increased consolidated operating income of the jm ney company  including the results of ney ultrasonics  and the gain on the sale of the dental segment  per share dividends increased from in fy to in fy net income for fy  the company reported net income of  after preferred dividends  and reversal of preferred dividends due to the repurchase of shares  income applicable to common shareholders was  or per share

during fy  the company made substantial investments in russian and eastern european markets  including an investment with a recorded value of  in avisma vsmpo  a russian titanium producer whose stock does not currently have a reported market value due to the relative sparseness in the stock s trading volume 
this security is recorded at its cost less a valuation reserve of  including this investment  the company s investment of  in the institute for automated systems and the above reported marketable securities  total russian and eastern european investments was  net of aforementioned valuation reserves 
this represents approximately of assets and of total stockholders equity 
during fy  pursuant to shareholder approval  the company exchanged  of its convertible subordinated debentures for an equal amount of new notes which bear the same interest rate and conversion terms  but do not contain restrictive covenants contained in the original issue 
the new notes have a longer average maturity  with the final maturity date being in pursuant to this exchange  the company paid the remaining  of an industrial revenue bond and  principal value of the debentures that were not tendered in the exchange 
the exchange and redemption of the original notes resulted in the elimination of a restriction concerning the payment of dividends 
accordingly  in february  approximately  of previously accrued but unpaid dividends on preferred stock were paid 
the company also received the consent of its shareholders to change the terms of its series a cumulative convertible preferred stock preferred stock  including elimination of the required redemption terms and an amendment of the dividend rate to a fixed annual amount of per share  paid quarterly 
prior to the change  the preferred stock called for dividends based upon the earnings of jm ney including the former dental and ultrasonics cleaning segments

concurrent with this note agreement  jm ney also amended the terms of its million revolving credit agreement which expanded its precious metals financing options  reduced jm ney s interest rates for certain borrowings under the line  and amended covenants to accommodate the new financing 
during fy  the prices of the precious metals that jm ney utilizes in the alloying and manufacturing of its products experienced significant volatility 
primarily as a net result of an increase of approximately per ounce of the palladium content of its inventory  and a per ounce decline in the gold component of its inventory  jm ney s lifo reserve increased by  to maintain the net recorded value of these inventories at their historical values 
as a result of covenants contained in its borrowing agreements  jm ney is restricted from paying dividends or otherwise transferring funds to the company outside the normal course of business  except as defined in certain agreements 
at february   jm ney s working capital and net worth  net of liabilities to the company  totaled approximately million and million  respectively

those uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following the company has expanded its investment and business development activities in russia and eastern europe 
economic and political developments in these countries could significantly impact both the return on and the return of capital employed in these regions 
anticipated contingent consideration from the sale of ney ultrasonics is dependent upon the successful marketing of technology developed while the company owned ney ultrasonics 
changes in technology  or shortfalls in the success of the buyer s marketing of this technology  could affect the ultimate consideration to be received 
the price and volatility of precious metals  particularly palladium and gold  could impact the market for many of jm ney s products as users substitute less expensive materials 
year the year compliance issues concern the inability of certain computerized information systems to properly recognize date sensitive information as the year approaches 
systems that do not recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail
