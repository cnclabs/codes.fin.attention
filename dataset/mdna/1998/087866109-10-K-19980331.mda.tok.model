item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial information and the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto 
accounting matters the company classifies loans as discounted or non discounted on a pool basis 
each pool is designated as discounted or non discounted based on whether that pool consists primarily of discounted or non discounted loans at the time of acquisition 
for example  a pool of non discounted loans may contain non performing loans at the time of acquisition as long as the non performing loans were not the primary component of the pool at that time 
as used herein  the term performing loan means a loan as to which payments have been and are being made substantially in accordance with its contractual terms  the term sub performing loan means a loan as to which payments are delinquent for days or less or has a history of delinquencies  and the term non performing loan means a loan as to which payments are generally or more days delinquent 
discounted loans are presented in the consolidated financial statements net of unamortized discount and an allowance for loan losses established for those loans 
for each pool of loans acquired by the company  purchased discounts are allocated into a valuation allowances for estimated losses against face value on specific loans specific valuation allowances and b portions of the discounts available for accretion to interest as yield adjustments 
in addition  for discounted loans purchased by first bank  the initial discounts are further segregated into a valuation allowance for the inherent risk of losses in the loan portfolio that have yet to be specifically identified general valuation allowance as required by ots regulations 
the allocated specific and general valuation allowances are included in the allowance for loan losses 
where appropriate  discounts are accreted into interest income generally on a cash basis 
the acquisition of a pool of discounted loans tends to reduce net interest margin and net interest spread  because the interest cost of the debt used to fund the acquisition is not offset by a corresponding increase in interest income 
relatively little cash flow from a pool of discounted loans is generally received during the first two quarters following an acquisition of a pool of discounted loans and the company only recognizes interest and discount on discounted loans in income when those loans result in the receipt of cash 
non discounted loans are presented in the consolidated financial statements in substantially the same manner as discounted loans  except that interest income is recognized on an accrual basis 
gains or losses on loans sold through securitization transactions are based on the difference between the cash proceeds received from the sale of the senior classes of mortgage backed securities to outside investors and the company s cost basis allocated to the senior classes of mortgage backed securities 
the company s cost basis in loans sold is allocated between the senior classes of mortgage backed securities and the subordinate classes of mortgage backed securities retained by the company based on the relative fair values of the two types of securities 
the cost basis of the loans securitized is determined by their acquisition cost  adjusted for any discount accretion for purchased loans or net carrying value for originated loans 
the company carries subordinate classes of mortgage backed securities at fair value 
as such  the carrying value of these securities is impacted by changes in market interest rates and prepayment and loss experiences of these and similar securities 
in cases where the company has financed the holding of subordinate classes with a lender under a repurchase agreement  the fair value used by the company is based on the lender s determination of market value for purposes of potential margin calls in determining fair value 
in other cases  the company determines the fair value of the subordinate classes of mortgage backed securities utilizing prepayment and credit loss assumptions it deems appropriate for each particular securitization 
the range of values attributable to the factors used in determining fair value is broad 
accordingly  the company s estimate of fair value is subjective 
for accounting purposes  the company s mortgage backed and other securities are classified as held to maturity  trading account securities and available for sale securities 
securities are classified as held to maturity when management believes the company has the ability and the positive intent to hold the securities to maturity 
securities classified as held to maturity are carried on an historical cost basis  adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using a method that approximates the interest method 
trading account securities include subordinate classes of mortgage backed securities issued in loan securitization transactions initiated by the company 
such securities are carried at estimated fair value as described above  and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in current operations 
securities are classified as available for sale when the company intends to hold the securities for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily to maturity 
securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair values 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported  net of tax  as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities are reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations and are calculated using the specific identification method 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans is originally recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
loan balances in excess of the fair value of real estate acquired are charged against the allowance for loan losses at the date of acquisition 
allowances are recorded to provide for estimated declines in the fair value subsequent to the date of acquisition 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  as well as gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are charged to current operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  the company did not record on its balance sheet the servicing rights retained to loans sold in securitizations  which would have had the effect of increasing other income and total assets 
the company now capitalizes servicing rights it purchases from third parties and on loans it sells on a servicing retained basis 
at december   the company had capitalized approximately million of servicing rights 
interest income a significant portion of the company s earnings come from net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received plus accreted or received purchase discount on its financial assets and the interest expense paid on its outstanding interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the percentage of discounted loans included in the portfolio and the timing of receipt or accretion of purchase discount 
in addition  net interest income reflects the full interest cost of funding the acquisition of discounted loans and foreclosed real estate but does not reflect any accretion of purchase discount on those assets until cash is collected which generally occurs later in the life of a pool of discounted loans and does not reflect any gain on sales of foreclosed real estate 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the total amount of income from interest earning assets and the resultant average yields  the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  expressed in dollars and rates  and the net interest spread and net interest margin 
information is based on monthly balances during the indicated periods

ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities the average balances of the loan portfolio include discounted loans and non performing loans  interest on which is recognized on a cash basis 
net interest spread represents average yield on interest earning assets minus average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the reduction in net interest margin and net interest spread in the year ended december  primarily reflects the significant increase in the company s holdings of discounted loans during the year then ended 
the acquisition of a pool of discounted loans tends to reduce net interest margin and net interest spread  because the interest cost of the debt used to fund the acquisition is not offset by a corresponding increase in interest income 
relatively little cash flow from a pool of discounted loans is generally received during the first two quarters following the acquisition of a pool of discounted loans and the company only recognizes interest and discount on discounted loans when those loans result in the receipt of cash 
in addition  a significant portion of the income associated with discounted loans generally results from gains on sales of foreclosed real estate  which are not reflected in interest income 
the reduction also reflected a full year of interest expense on the million of notes and part of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter of interest expense on approximately million of series a notes  the proceeds of which were held for part of such period in a lower yielding liquid investment prior to their use by the company to fund acquisitions 
the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii total change in rate and volume 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the company s asset base was significantly larger in as a result of the company s initial public offering in december and significantly higher levels of borrowing and investment opportunities 
interest income the company s interest income was approximately million for compared to approximately million for  an increase of 
the increase in the company s interest income was due primarily to an increase in the company s average interest earning assets from approximately million in to approximately billion in interest expense the company s interest expense was approximately million for compared with approximately million for  an increase of 
the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the company s average interest bearing liabilities to approximately billion in from approximately million in and includes the issuance in the fourth quarter of and early of million of the company s notes and the issuance in the third quarter of of million of the company s series a notes 
primarily as a result of the company s million of notes  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in provisions for estimated losses on loans provision for estimated losses on loans for was approximately million resulting from additional provisions of approximately million  which was partially offset by the reversal of approximately million of excess reserves on loans previously sold

gains on sale of loans the gain on the sale of loans for is the result of the sale of loans with a book value of approximately million  of which approximately million were sold through whole loan sales and approximately million were sold through securitizations 
for  gain on the sale of whole loans totaled approximately million and gains from securitizations totaled approximately million 
gains or losses on loan portfolios sold as whole loans or through securitization transactions are based on the difference between the cash proceeds received on the loans sold to outside investors and the company s cost basis allocated to the loans excluding any cost basis attributable to servicing rights retained 
gain on the sale of securities the gain on the sale of securities for is a result of the sale of approximately million of mortgage backed securities which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
this gain reflects the company s strategy of investing in subordinate classes of mortgage backed securities which the company believes are likely to experience a ratings upgrade as a result of payment history  prepayment or default experience or otherwise 
the company believes that its experience in acquiring pools of loans allows it to more effectively evaluate the risks associated with a pool of loans that supports an issue of mortgage backed securities being considered for purchase and price those securities 
real estate owned  net the increase in income from real estate owned  net is primarily due to gains on the disposition of real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof from the company s portfolio of discounted loans or from the properties acquired in the fourth quarter of servicing revenue the increase in servicing revenue of approximately million in was primarily the result of contracting for servicing rights on loan portfolios owned by unaffiliated third parties and arranging for such loan portfolios to be serviced by the us servicer at a rate which is lower than the rate received by the company 
other expense the company s other expense totaled approximately million for compared to approximately million for  an increase of  which reflects the significant growth of the company s asset base and operations 
loan service fees and expenses paid to affiliate the largest component of other expense in was loan service fees and expenses  which includes servicing fees paid to the us servicer and collection related expenses incurred directly by the us servicer and reimbursed by the company 
loan service fees and expenses paid to affiliate were approximately million for compared to approximately million for  an increase of approximately 
the increase in loan servicing fees and expenses paid to affiliate was primarily the result of the increase in the unpaid principal balance of loans being serviced by the us servicer on behalf of the company to approximately billion at december  from approximately million at december  and an increase in sub servicing fees of approximately million 
also  collection related expense increased from to due to the substantial increase in discounted loans 
discounted loans generally require more significant expenditures than performing and sub performing loans 
compensation and employee benefits compensation and employee benefits was approximately million for  compared to approximately million for  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees from for to for  reflecting the expansion of business activities  particularly loan acquisition activities and the growth of activities at the non bank subsidiaries 
other general administrative expenses increased from approximately million for to approximately for due primarily to the expansion of business activities at the non bank subsidiaries  particularly loan acquisition activities such as due diligence costs 
income tax provision income tax provision was approximately million for compared with approximately million for the change was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss deductions in and a normalized tax provision in results of operations compared to net interest income the company s net interest income increased by approximately million or during  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase resulted from an approximately million or increase to interest income due to an approximately million or increase in average interest earning assets from period to period 
the increase in interest income was offset in part by an approximately million or increase in interest expense due to an approximately million or increase in average interest bearing liabilities  primarily certificates of deposit  and  to a lesser extent  a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest income during  as compared to the same period in the prior year  reflects substantial increases in the average balances of the company s loans and mortgage backed securities 
provisions for loan losses provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to maintain an allowance for losses at a level that management considers adequate based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks  historical loss experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the savings banks recorded provisions for losses on loans totaling approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for the prior year  an increase of 
the following table sets forth the savings banks provision for loan losses for the year ended december provision of total dollars in thousands inherited loans  sub prime auto loans  other purchase loans  total provision for loan losses  approximately million of the increase in the provisions from to was made after discussions between the ots and the savings banks concerning the appropriate provision for the sub prime auto loans acquired by the savings banks in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the company also increased the provision by approximately million in related to the inherited loans owned by first bank or girard at the time the savings banks were acquired by the company 
although management attempts to utilize its best judgment in providing for possible loan losses  changing economic and business conditions  fluctuations in local markets for real estate  future changes in non performing asset trends  large movements in market interest rates or other factors could affect the company s future provisions for loan losses 
in addition  the ots as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews the adequacy of the savings banks allowances for losses on non discounted loans and discounted loans and may require adjustments to the savings banks allowances for loan losses 
net interest income after provision for estimated losses on loans the company s net interest income after provision for estimated losses on loans decreased to approximately million for from income of approximately million for this decrease was due to the substantial increase in provisions for estimated losses on loans 
other income the company s other income was approximately million for compared to approximately million for  an increase of 
this increase was primarily attributable to gains on the sale of loans

the largest component of other expense in was loan service fees and expense which increased by approximately million from approximately million for to approximately million for loan servicing fees and charges are paid to the us 
servicer and include a servicing fees  and b collection related expenses incurred directly by the us servicer and reimbursed by the company 
servicing fees for discounted loans have been based on a percentage of cash flows collected 
therefore  when discounted loans are sold  servicing fees increase substantially 
the volume of loans  particularly discounted loans  being serviced by the us servicer  increased substantially during compared to due to substantial growth in the company s loan pool acquisition activity 
in addition  due to a securitization of non performing loans primarily discounted loans in march  higher fees associated with the accelerated cash flows to the savings banks were paid to the us servicer in the first quarter of that year 
compensation and employee benefits 
other expense relating to compensation and employee benefits also increased from approximately million for to approximately million for  an increase of approximately million or

short term borrowings 
short term borrowings increased by approximately million during  resulting from increased use of repurchase agreements and warehouse financing instead of deposits to fund the purchase of loans and securities 
asset and liability management asset and liability management analyzes the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to limit the company s exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset and liability committees for the company and first bank the asset and liability committees which meet regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset and liability committees coordinate with first bank s board of directors and the company s investment committees with respect to overall asset and liability composition 
since most of the company s assets and liabilities reprice relatively frequently  the company s gap tends to be relatively easy to manage and the company s interest rate risk analysis focuses less on managing the overall gap and more on ensuring that individual pools of loans are properly hedged 
in hedging the interest rate exposure of a fixed rate or lagging index asset that is held for sale  the company creates a hedge which matches the principal amortization of such asset against the maturity of the company s liabilities generally by entering into short sales or forward sales of us treasury securities  government securities  interest rate futures contracts  interest rate swap agreements or the purchase of interest only mortgage securities 
this results in market gains or losses on hedging instruments  in response to interest rate increases or decreases  respectively  which approximate the amount of the corresponding market losses or gains  respectively  on loans being hedged 
the company evaluates the interest rate sensitivity of each pool of loans and decides whether to hedge the interest rate exposure of a particular pool of loans 
the company generally does not hedge the interest rate risk associated with holding non lagging index adjustable rate mortgages pending their sale or securitization due to the decreased significance of such risk 
in general  when a pool of loans is acquired  the company will determine whether or not to hedge and  with respect to any sale or financing of any pool of loans through securitization  the company will determine whether or not to discontinue its duration matched hedging activities with respect to the relevant loans 
the company will seek to purchase interest only securities ios to hedge against maturity extension risk in the company s loan and securities portfolio in the event that the company encounters slower than anticipated prepayments while still anticipating an acceptable return on the purchase of such ios 
accordingly  if the underlying mortgage collateral prepays including prepayments as a result of default and repurchases by the seller at a rate faster than anticipated  the weighted average life of the io will be reduced  and the yield to maturity adversely affected 
conversely  if the underlying mortgage collateral prepays at a rate slower than anticipated  the weighted average life of the io will be extended  with a consequent positive effect on the anticipated yield to maturity 
the asset and liability committees are authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist them in the management of interest rate risk 
these techniques include interest rate swap agreements  pursuant to which the parties exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest payments on a specified principal amount referred to as the notional amount for a specified period without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate swap agreements are utilized by the company to protect against the narrowing of the interest spread between fixed rate loans and associated liabilities funding those loans 
the company had approximately million notional principal amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   which had the effect of decreasing the company s net interest income by approximately million during in addition  as required by ots regulations  the asset and liability committees also regularly review interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity mvpe  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and mvpe that is authorized by the board of directors of first bank 
in addition  at december   management estimates based upon the mvpe analysis prepared by the ots that the estimated percentage change in the company s mvpe over the ensuing four quarter period as a result of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be an approximate decrease or decrease  respectively 
the following table highlights the interest rate sensitivity of the ots s models of mvpe of a change in rates from to basis points bp as of december  interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value net portfolio value change in rates amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp   bp   bp  bp  bp  bp   bp   bp   management of first bank believes that the assumptions including pre payment assumptions used by it to evaluate the vulnerability of first bank s operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of first bank s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on first bank s net interest income and mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
additionally  the ots s model does not incorporate all of the terms and features of the hedging instruments 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of the company s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  purchase pools of loans  and newly originated mortgage and manufactured housing loans  and for general business purposes 
the company s sources of cash flow include certificates of deposit  securitizations  net interest income and borrowings under its warehouse and repurchase financing facilities and from institutional investors and other lenders and public and private debt offerings  including the notes and the series a notes 
in certain limited circumstances  the company also has borrowed money from the wilshire private companies in order to fund the acquisition of loans 
the company repaid such borrowings with pik preferred stock on july  the company redeemed the pik preferred stock in february in addition  first bank obtains funding through fhlb advances 
the company s liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the board of directors of the company 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flows for off balance sheet instruments 
sources of liquidity for first bank include wholesale and brokered certificates of deposit 
at december   first bank had approximately million of certificates of deposit 
at december   scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the months ending december  and thereafter amounted to approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
brokered and other wholesale deposits generally are more responsive to changes in interest rates than core deposits and  thus  are more likely to be withdrawn by the investor upon maturity as changes in interest rates and other factors are perceived by investors to make other investments more attractive 
however  management of first bank believes it can adjust the rates paid on certificates of deposit to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments and that brokered and other wholesale deposits can be both a relatively cost effective and stable source of funds 
at december   the company s sources of borrowing included i an uncommitted master repurchase agreement between first bank and bear stearns mortgage capital corporation as to which the parties have orally agreed that approximately million would be available for the purchase of loans  ii a committed million warehouse lending agreement with prudential securities credit corporation  and iii certain repurchase arrangements with major investment banks  including million committed under a repurchase agreement with credit suisse first boston mortgage capital llc subsequent to december   the facility was increased to million and million committed under several repurchase agreements with salomon brothers realty corp 
sources of borrowings also include fhlb advances  which are required to be secured by eligible securities collateral  and reverse repurchase agreements 
at december   first bank had no fhlb advances outstanding  and was eligible to borrow up to an aggregate of million from the fhlb of san francisco and had million of unencumbered mortgage backed and related securities which could be pledged to secure such borrowings 
the company s uses of cash include the funding of purchases of us residential discounted loans and non discounted loans  us commercial non discounted loans  mortgage backed securities and newly originated mortgage and manufactured housing loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of loans  funding of initial over collateralization requirements for securitizations  operating and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
the company s purchases of pools of loans and other assets are expected to utilize secured borrowings and be highly leveraged 
the actual dollar amount of secured borrowings incurred by the company will vary depending on a number of factors  including the amount of leverage lenders are willing to make available which will be affected by market conditions  and management s determination as to the appropriate amount of leverage 
with respect to pools of us discounted loans and us non discounted loans  the company generally seeks to fund and  respectively  of the purchase price of such pools of loans with borrowed money 
the company draws on a number of sources to obtain such funds including certificates of deposit and repurchase arrangements with major investment banks 
capital expenditures by the company have not been material 
the company is party to various off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage its interest rate risk 
the company conducts business with a variety of financial institutions and other companies in the normal course of business  including counterparties to its off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company is subject to potential financial loss if the counterparty is unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
the company seeks to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis and other monitoring procedures 
adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding  including the ability of the company to securitize loans  are essential to the continuation of the company s ability to purchase pools of loans  mortgage backed securities and newly originated mortgage and manufactured housing loans 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  the proceeds of certificates of deposit  the availability under the warehouse financing facility and other borrowings  and the net proceeds from securitizations will be sufficient to fund current operating needs  commitments and capital expenditures in the near term 
after utilizing available working capital  deposits and any securitization proceeds  the company borrows money to fund its loan purchases and originations 
at december   and  the company used borrowings under various repurchase arrangements and fhlb advances in the approximate amounts of million  million and million  respectively  for new loan purchases and originations  purchases of real estate owned  and subordinated securities 
the company s business plan generally calls for using a high degree of leverage in acquiring loan portfolios 
with respect to loan portfolios of discounted loans and performing loans  the company generally seeks to fund and  respectively  of the market value of such loan portfolios with borrowed money 
the company draws on a number of sources to obtain such funds including certificates of deposit and repurchase arrangements with wall street investment banks 
given the company s rapid growth and assuming that the company continues to experience such growth  management believes that additional debt and or equity financing may be required to sustain this level of growth once a substantial portion of the company s equity offering  which was completed in february  are invested 
the notes and series b notes contain certain limitations on indebtedness which may restrict the ability of the company to issue additional indebtedness in the future and the company may be obligated to seek equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any such debt or equity financing will be available to the company on financially attractive terms in the future 
the company is required to maintain funds sufficient to meet two semiannual interest payments on the notes and the series b notes in liquid assets 
in addition  first bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government  federal agency and other investments having maturities of five years or less 
current ots regulations require that a savings association maintain liquid assets of not less than of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less  of which short term liquid assets must consist of not less than 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet applicable liquidity requirements 
the company and first bank have complied with these requirements 
regulatory capital requirements federally insured savings associations such as first bank are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
these standards generally are as stringent as the comparable capital requirements imposed on national banks 
the ots also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual associations on a case by case basis 
in connection with the examination  prior to the merger between first bank and girard  the ots indicated that the capital level of girard was less than satisfactory and the capital level of first bank was not adequate in view of their risk profiles  despite the fact that the savings banks had capital levels that would otherwise have qualified them as well capitalized under ots regulatory capital requirements 
the ots also indicated that the savings banks current capital requirements may not be appropriate given the deficiencies noted in the examination 
as a result  the order required first bank to maintain core capital and risk based capital equal to the dollar amount of capital at first bank and girard at march   as measured at the end of each calendar quarter 
the order provided that in the event capital falls below the levels required by the order as a result of any determination by the ots or otherwise that adversely affects first bank s financial condition  first bank would have to raise additional capital 
if the ots were to impose higher capital requirements on first bank or additional capital were required as a result of an adverse determination by the ots or otherwise  the company might inject additional capital into first bank  whether or not such usage of capital is optimal for the company 
first bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on first bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  first bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of first bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
first bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require first bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tangible capital  core capital and risk based capital  as these terms are defined in ots regulations 
under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  quantitative and qualitative measures are used by the ots to determine whether an institution is categorized as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  or significantly undercapitalized 
certain regulatory actions are mandated by law  depending on an institution s category 
quantitative measures include total capital to risk weighted assets  tier i capital to risk weighted assets  and tier i capital to tangible assets  as these terms are defined in ots regulations 
at december   the total core capital and total risk based capital amounts of first bank compared to the ots requirements contained in the order was as follows actual ots requirement excess total core capital    total risk based capital   the following table sets forth the regulatory capital ratios of first bank at december  regulatory capital ratios to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt for capital corrective actual adequacy purposes action provisions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands total capital to risk weighted assets risk based capital   greater than or to  greater than or to tier capital to risk weighted assets  not applicable  greater than or to core capital to tangible assets    greater than or to tangible capital to tangible assets   greater than or to not applicable these capital adequacy ratios represent the requirements for all savings institutions 
first bank s minimum capital requirements are the ratios specified in the orders and those in the column containing the well capitalized requirements as well as the capital amounts indicated in the preceding table 
as of december   first bank s capital ratios were sufficient for it to be categorized as well capitalized based solely on quantitative measurement and the ots orally indicated that the bank is considered to be well capitalized at this time 
first bank has not been notified by the ots as to its capital category 
if notified or otherwise deemed to be categorized as less than well capitalized  first bank could be subject to restrictions in addition to those specified in the order  including restrictions on holding brokered deposits 
as of december   first bank had brokered deposits of million 
because first bank has minimum regulatory capital requirements and the additional requirements under the order discussed above  substantially all retained earnings of first bank are restricted as to distribution to wac and  ultimately  to wfsg 
regulation following examinations of the savings banks and wac  the holding company for the savings banks  by the ots in   and  the ots issued reports of examination that were critical of the savings banks and wac in a number of respects 
these regulatory concerns initially resulted in the ots requiring first bank to enter into a supervisory agreement on june  the supervisory agreement required first bank to take actions to achieve compliance with certain laws and regulations and safe and sound practices and to a develop plans and procedures concerning i reduction of non performing assets  ii internal asset review  iii asset monitoring  iv appraisals  v loan underwriting  vi loan purchases  b enhance record keeping  c develop requirements to ensure that the servicing of loans by the wilshire private companies is satisfactory  and d maintain its separate corporate existence 
in addition  the supervisory agreement required first bank to maintain certain minimum capital ratios and prohibited first bank from increasing total assets beyond specified levels and acquiring non performing assets without the prior written consent of ots 
in july  the ots advised first bank that it had not fully complied with the terms of the supervisory agreement and that the savings banks had failed in a number of respects to address regulatory concerns raised in the and examination reports 
the ots also expressed continuing concerns regarding the adequacy of management of first bank in light of its business activities 
as a result of these issues  the ots replaced the supervisory agreement with a cease and desist order  effective october  given the similar nature of girard s business activities  the ots has also issued a cease and desist order to girard similar to the order issued to first bank  also effective october  the issuance of a cease and desist order is generally evidence of an increased level of regulatory concern regarding the subject institution 
in october  the savings banks entered into amended orders with the ots which modified certain provisions of the original cease and desist orders  effective october  with the approval of the ots  first bank and girard merged in december management believes that first bank must continue to meet the aggregate requirements of the orders 
the order prohibits first bank from increasing its total assets  as measured at the end of each calendar quarter  in excess of million plus total net interest credited on deposit liabilities 
on march   the ots provided first bank conceptual approval to increase its total assets to million 
there can be no assurance as to when or if the ots will amend the order to reflect such increase 
the order also prohibits first bank from purchasing i any loans or real estate  without the approval of the ots  until certain acquisition and servicing deficiencies identified by the ots have been corrected  and ii any non performing assets or foreclosed real estate until such time as first bank is rated a composite rating according to the uniform financial institutions rating system 
the order requires first bank to i maintain an effective internal asset review system that provides for adequate internal controls to ensure that management timely reviews and classifies assets pursuant to their policies  ii fully comply with all policies and procedures submitted to the ots pursuant to the previous cease and desist orders  iii operate pursuant to and comply with their business plans  iv submit to the ots a written plan to develop or obtain the internal expertise and resources necessary to measure  monitor and model net interest income and net portfolio value the irr plan  v review and analyze the terms of all existing loan servicing or other agreements with affiliates  to confirm that such agreements comply with the order and that there are formal written agreements with respect to all transactions with affiliates  and vi compare the results of profitability models with the performance of purchased assets 
the order also requires first bank to submit to the ots after each calendar quarter  reports i detailing their progress in implementing their allowance for loan losses policies and the results of their reserve analysis for the preceding calendar quarter  ii detailing any violations of the policies and procedures submitted to the ots that occurred during the preceding quarter  together with an explanation as to what caused or contributed to the act or practice constituting such violation  and what  if any  corrective action has been undertaken  iii detailing any variances from the business plans that occurred during the preceding quarter  showing actual and planned results  and explaining any variances greater than percent  and iv detailing the progress in implementing the irr plan during the preceding quarter 
the order also requires first bank to elect at least two additional new outside directors with specific financial institution industry experience 
such outside directors cannot have any association with affiliates of first bank  the company or institution affiliated parties 
one director has been added and another is currently pending ots approval 
to address regulatory concerns  first bank submitted to the ots a bankcard plan the bankcard plan which i established a method by which first bank will estimate the appropriate level of reserves for its bankcard operations  ii established internal controls  iii created an overdraft policy that requires timely recognition of overdraft losses and identifies employees with authority to approve overdrafts  and iv ensures that first bank will comply with all applicable statutes and regulations 
after each calendar quarter  first bank is required to report to the ots  in writing  any variances to the bankcard plan 
the order is enforceable by the ots as written agreements under the federal deposit insurance act 
therefore  failure to comply with the requirements of the order could subject first bank and its directors and officers to further enforcement actions  including termination of federal deposit insurance corporation insurance or civil money penalties 
management believes that first bank is in material compliance with the various provisions of the orders
