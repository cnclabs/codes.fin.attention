see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements presented in item the company has raised  from inception through december   cumulative net proceeds of approximately million through private placements of equity securities and the issuance of long term debt 
if the company is successful in raising additional capital  wsi intends to aggressively pursue and develop an integrated solid waste management company

certain factors affecting future operating results history of losses 
during the fiscal years ending december   and  the company suffered net losses including non recurring charges of approximately   and  respectively  on revenues of   and  respectively 
prospects for future profitability are heavily dependent upon the success of the company s acquisition strategy and in its ability to continue to build integrated solid waste management operations 
there can be no assurance that wsi will generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or  if profitable  to maintain profitability in future years uncertain ability to finance the company s growth 
the company has limited liquidity in relation to its short term capital commitments and operating cash requirements 
additionally  wsi will require substantial funds to complete and bring to commercial viability all of its currently planned projects 
the company also anticipates that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under its bank line of credit  the issuance of the company s common stock or seller financing  or additional equity or debt financings 
therefore  wsi s ability to satisfy its capital commitments and operating requirements are dependent on a number of pending or future financing activities  none of which are assured successful completion 
any failure of the company to obtain sufficient financing in the short run would have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
dependence on management 
the company s future success is highly dependent upon the services of its executive officers  particularly  philip strauss  chairman  chief executive officer and president of the company  and robert rivkin  vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary of the company 
the loss of the services of mr 
strauss or mr 
rivkin could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
wsi does not currently maintain key man insurance on any of its personnel 
the company s future success is also highly dependent upon its continuing ability to identify  hire  train and motivate highly qualified personnel 
wsi faces competition for hiring such personnel from other companies  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurances that wsi will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel as required for its projected operations 
the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to manage growth 
the company s objective is to contiue to grow by expanding its services in markets where it can be one of the largest and most profitable fully integrated solid waste management companies 
accordingly  the company may experience periods of significant rapid growth 
such growth  if it were to occur  could place a significant strain on the company s management and its operational  financial and other resources 
any failure to expand its operational  and financial systems and controls or to recruit appropriate personnel in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with such growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to identify  acquire and integrate acquisition targets 
the future success of the company is highly dependent upon the company s continued ability to successfully identify  acquire and integrate additional solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal businesses 
as competition for acquisition candidates increases within the solid waste management industry  the availability of suitable candidates at terms favorable to the company decreases 
the company competes for acquisition candidates with larger  more established companies that may have significantly greater capital resources  which can further decrease the availability of suitable acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and if available  will be able to obtain necessary financings at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to the company  or to successfully integrate the acquisitions with current operations 
the company believes that a significant factor in its ability to consumate acquisitions will be the attractiveness of the company s common stock as consideration for potential acquisition targets 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of the company s equity securities as compared to its competitors 
if the market price of the company s common stock were to decline  the company s acquistion program could be materially adversely affected 
competition 
the solid waste management industry is highly competitive  very fragmented and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
competition exists for collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services  and acquisition targets 
the markets the company competes or is likely to compete in are usually served by one or more of the large national  regional or local solid waste companies who may have accumulated substantial goodwill and or have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than wsi 
the company also competes with counties  municipalities and operators of alternative disposal facilities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities 
the availability of user fees  charges or tax revenues and the availability of tax exempt financing may provide a competitive advantage to the public sector 
additionally  alternative disposal facilities such as recycling and incineration may reduce the demand for the disposal of solid waste in landfills 
competition for waste collection and disposal business is based on the quality of operation  price and geographical location 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand or maintain market share or to win competitively bid contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully bid such contracts or compete with the larger and better capitalized companies 
limitations on landfill permitting and expansion 
the company s operations depend on its ability to expand the landfills it owns or operates and develop new landfill sites 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of its landfill 
the process of obtaining required permits and approvals to operate and expand landfills and transfer stations has become increasingly difficult and expensive 
the process can take several years and involves hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining and maintaining required permits 
even when granted  final permits to expand are often not approved until the remaining capacity of the landfill is very low 
in the event the company exhausts its permitted capcaity at its landfill  the company s ability to expand internally will be limited and the company will be required to cap and close the landfill 
in addition  the company could be forced to dispose of its waste at landfills operated by its competitors 
the additional costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
geographic concentration of operations 
the company has initially established integrated solid waste management operations in vermont  and is developing integrated solid waste management operations in central pennsylvania and western massachusetts 
since the company s current primary source of revenues will be concentrated in these geographic locations  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations can be materially effected by  but not limited to  the following i downturns in the local economy  ii severely harsh weather conditions  and iii state regulations 
additionally  the growing competition within the local economies for waste streams may make it increasingly difficult to expand within these regions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase the waste stream to its landfills  or be able to expand its geographic markets to lessen the effects of adverse events that may occur in these region 
seasonality 
the company s revenues and results of operations tend to vary seasonally 
the winter months of the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year tend to yield lower revenues than those experienced in the warmer months of the second and third quarters 
the primary reasons for lower revenues in the winter months include  but are not limited to i harsh winter weather conditions which can interfere with collection and transportation  ii construction and demolition activities which generate landfill waste are primarily performed in the warmer seasons  and iii the volume of waste in the region is generally lower in comparison to that which occurs in warmer months 
the company believes that the seasonality of the revenue stream will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations on an annualized basis 
environmental and government regulations 
the company and its customers operate in a highly regulated environment  and in general the company s landfill projects will be required to have federal  state and or local government permits and approvals see business government regulation 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
in addition  if new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently  wsi or its customers may be required to obtain additional operating permits or approvals 
there can be no assurance that wsi will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements 
any delay in obtaining required permits or approvals will tend to cause delays in the company s ability to obtain bond or other project financing  resulting in increases in the company s needs to invest working capital in projects prior to obtaining more permanent financing  and will also tend to reduce project returns by deferring the receipt of project revenues 
in the event that the company is required to cancel any planned project as a result of the inability to obtain required permits or other regulatory impediments  the company may lose any investment it has made in the project up to that point  and the cancellation of any landfill projects  may have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
potential environmental liability and adverse effect of environmental regulation 
wsi s business exposes it to the risk that it will be held liable if harmful substances escape into the environment and cause damages or injuries as a result of its operating activities 
moreover  federal  state and local environmental legislation and regulations require substantial expenditures and impose significant liabilities for noncompliance 
see business government regulation in item potential adverse community relations 
the potential exists for unexpected delays  costs and litigation resulting from community resistance and concerns relating to specific projects in various communities 
performance or surety bonds and letters of credit 
the company may be required to post a performance or surety bond  or letter of credit to ensure proper closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance at its landfills and transfer stations 
failure to obtain performance or surety bonds  or letters of credit in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limits on insurance 
the company has obtained environmental impairment liability insurance covering claims for sudden or gradual onset of environmental damage 
if the company were to incur a liability for environmental damage in excess of its insurance limits  its financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company carries a comprehensive general liability insurance policy which management considers adequate at this time to protect its assets and operations from other risks 
adequacy of accruals for closure and post closure costs 
the company has material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of its existing landfills and any landfill it may purchase or operate in the future 
the company estimates and accrues closure and post closure costs based on engineering estimates of airspace usage and remaining airspace capacity 
there can be no assurances that the company s financial obligations for closure and post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued  and that this may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
capital expenditures 
the company capitalizes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  certain expenditures and advances relating to acquisitions  pending acquisitions and landfill projects 
the company s policy is to expense in the current period  all unamortized capital expenditures and advances relating to any operation that is permanently shut down or any acquisition that will not be consummated and any landfill project that is terminated 
thus  the company may be required to incur a charge against earnings in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions and results of operations 
inflation wsi does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation
