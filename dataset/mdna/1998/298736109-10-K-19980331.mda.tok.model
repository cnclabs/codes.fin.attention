item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company was formed and established its first office in budapest hungary in june in may  the company opened its second office  in warsaw poland 
during  the company also opened offices in berlin germany  zagreb croatia  prague the czech republic  paris france and bucharest romania 
to date  euronet has devoted substantially all of its resources to establishing its atm network through the acquisition and installation of atms and computers and software for its transaction processing center and through the marketing of its services to local banks as well as international card organizations 
euronet installed its first atm in hungary in june  and at the end of  the company had atms installed 
an additional atms were installed during in hungary and poland and as of december   the company s atm network consisted of atms 
during the company installed a further atms  consisting of in hungary and poland and in germany and croatia 
with the expansion of operations  the company increased the number of its employees in hungary from as of december  to as of december  in poland  the company increased the number of its employees from as of december  to as of december  in  the company employed people in croatia  in germany  in the czech republic  and in france 
in  of the company s revenues were generated in hungary and poland 
the company s expansion of its network infrastructure and administrative and marketing capabilities has resulted in increased expenditures 
further planned expansion will continue to result in increases in general operating expenses as well as expenses related to the acquisition and installation of atms 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from atm transaction fees since inception 
the company receives a fee from the card issuing banks or international card organizations for atm transactions processed on its atms 
as the company continues to focus on expanding its network and installing additional atms  the company expects that transaction fees will continue to account for a substantial majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s existing contracts with banks and international card organizations provide for reduced transaction fees with increases in transaction volume 
as the company s transaction levels continue to increase  the average fee it receives per transaction will decrease 
however  the company expects that because the decrease in transaction fees is tied to an increase in transactional volume  the overall revenues of the company should increase despite the fee discounts 
however  the company expects that transaction levels may  however  be negatively impacted if all or a large part of the transaction fees are passed on to cardholders by client banks 
the transaction volumes processed on an atm in any given market are affected by a number of factors  including location of the atm and the amount of time the atm has been installed at the location 
the company s experience has been that the number of transactions on a newly installed atm is initially very low and takes approximately three to six months after installation to achieve average transaction volumes for that market 
accordingly  the average number of transactions  and thus revenues  per atm are expected to increase as the percentage of atms operating in the company s network for over six months increases 
the company recently began to sell advertising on its network by putting clients advertisements on its atms and the receipts 
advertising revenue accounted for approximately of total consolidated revenues during the company believes that advertising revenues will continue to increase as it expands its network and continues to market this service 
the company also began to generate revenues during from atm network management services that it offers to banks that own proprietary atm networks 
although the revenues generated to date have been small  the company believes that revenues from this service will increase in the future 
the company has had substantial increases in the level of operations  including atms operated and total personnel in  and in addition  the company was in the development stage until june when it began operations in hungary 
as a result  a comparison of the company s results of operations between such years is not necessarily meaningful 
the company s expenses consist of atm operating expenses and other operating expenses 
atm operating expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of atm site rentals  depreciation of atms and atm installation costs  maintenance  telecommunications  insurance  and cash delivery and security services to atms 
atm operating expenses will necessarily increase as the company s network expands 
other operating expenses consist of items such as salaries  professional fees  communication and travel related expenditures 
while these expenditures are anticipated to increase with the company s expansion into new markets and the introduction products  other operating expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues 
total revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues both in and were due primarily to the significant increase in transaction fees resulting from the increase in transaction volume attributable to additional network connections to credit and debit card issuers and an increase in the number of atms operated by the company during these periods 
the company had atms  atms  and atms installed at the end of   and  respectively 
transaction fee revenue represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for the year ended december  revenues in the year ended december  consisted entirely of transaction fees 
transaction fees charged by the company vary for the three types of transactions that are currently processed on the company s atms cash withdrawals  balance inquiries and transactions not completed because authorization is not given by the relevant card issuer 
approximately of transaction fees in  as compared to in  were attributable to cash withdrawals 
the remaining in and in were attributable to balance inquiries and transactions not completed because authorization is not given by the relevant card issuer 
transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction while transaction fees for the other two types of transactions are generally substantially less 
in january  otp notified the company that it was terminating its contract with euronet effective as of july  as a result of this termination  the company will not have a direct connection with otp and will not be able to accept otp proprietary bank cards 
the company will  however  still be able to accept all otp issued visa and europay cards through its visa and europay gateways 
for the year ended december   the company s contract with otp represented approximately of its consolidated revenues 
the financial impact of the otp contract termination is difficult to assess 
the company believes that such impact may be mitigated in part because i the company believes that visa and europay cards represent over of the cards issued by otp and ii the company receives a higher fee for transactions processed through its visa and europay gateway s than for otp proprietary bank cards 
however  the company believes that some of otp s cardholders will be dissuaded from patronizing euronet s atms due to the higher fees passed through to customers for transactions processed through the visa and europay connection 
other revenues of  and  for the years ended december  and consisted primarily of advertising revenue 
the increase during results from the increase in the number of atms operated by the company 
there were no other revenues in operating expenses 
total expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  this increase in both years were due primarily to costs associated with the installation of significant numbers of atms during the periods and expansion of the company s operations during the periods 
in addition a share compensation expense of  relating to the grant of certain employee and management options was charged to operating expenses in atm operating costs  which consist primarily of atm site rentals  depreciation of atms and costs associated with maintaining  providing telecommunications and cash delivery services to atms increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  the percentage of atm operating costs to total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the increase in atm operating costs was primarily attributable to costs associated with operating the increased number of atms in the network during the periods 
the number of atms installed increased from to from december  to december   and from to from december  to december  professional fees increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  the fees in  primarily legal  related to its expansion to new markets 
the level of fees in was due primarily to legal fees attributable to the investment by new investors in the company  the interim reorganization of the company into a netherlands antilles company and the expansion of the company s operations into poland 
salaries increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and from  for the year ended december  the increase from to reflected the increase in employees from to and the increase from to reflected the increase in the number of employees from to  as discussed above 
communication  rent and utilities  and travel related costs increased to   and  respectively for the year ended december  from   and  for the year ended december   and   and  for the year ended december  the increases in all cases relate to the expansion of the company s operations in both years  as previously discussed 
fees and charges increased to  for the year ended december  from  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these costs include  and  respectively  of expenses which the company has recorded relating to the late payments of customs duties and hungarian value added taxes in connection with the restructuring of its atm leases in hungary 
prior to any such restructuring  such leases were structured as operating leases for hungarian accounting purposes although treated as capital leases for us gaap purposes  and its atms have therefore been imported under a temporary import scheme 
the atms are subject to a re export requirement and this has the effect of postponing payment of customs duties 
the company has decided to restructure such lease arrangements as capital leases for hungarian accounting purposes  and the company recorded the related charges as other expenses 
customs duties have been capitalized as part of the cost of the atms under capital lease and depreciated over the useful lives of the atms 
share compensation of  with respect to the grant of certain employee and management options  was recorded in the non cash charge  calculated in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 represents the difference between the estimated fair market value of the shares underlying such options at the date of option grant and the exercise price 
estimated fair market value at the grant dates in the last quarter of was assumed to be the cash price for the sale of shares in the next succeeding third party purchase of shares  which accrued in february with respect to these options  an additional  is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of such options 
of this amount   has been expensed during the year ended december  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
the company had a net foreign exchange gain of  for the year ended december   and net foreign exchange losses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
exchange gains and losses that result from remeasurement of assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net loss 
see note c to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
a substantial portion of the assets and liabilities of the company are denominated in us dollars  including  for instance  fixed assets  stockholders equity and capital lease obligations 
additionally  it is the company s policy to attempt to match local currency receivables and payables 
hence  the amount of unmatched assets and liabilities giving rise to foreign exchange gains and losses is relatively limited  consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents 
the company has invested in german mark denominated government securities as a hedge against certain german mark denominated lease obligations 
other operating expenses  which include marketing  depreciation  which represents significant increase in non atm related assets  and insurance  increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  these increases were in line with the expansion of the company s operations during such periods 
the increase of  in over results primarily from the expansion into new and existing markets 
other income expense 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in was the result of the investments made by the company in us state and municipal obligations  corporate debentures  us federal agency and foreign government obligations using the proceeds from the equity offering 
the amount held under such investments at december  was  compared to  at december  during the increase was due to larger amounts held in interest bearing accounts  including restricted cash held as security for certain of the company s vendors  banks supplying cash to euronet s atms and certain other parties 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense relating principally to capital leases of atms and euronet s computer systems increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the increase of capital lease obligations outstanding during the periods 
net loss 
the company s net loss increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has sustained negative cash flows from operations and has financed its operations and capital expenditures primarily through the proceeds from the equity offering  through equipment lease financing and through private placements of equity securities 
the net proceeds of such transactions  together with revenues from operations and interest income have been used to fund aggregate net losses of approximately  and investments in property  plant and equipment 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  the company had  of restricted cash held as security with respect to cash provided by banks participating in euronet s atm network  to cover guarantees to a customer and as deposits with customs officials 
the company expects to continue to generate losses from operating activities  and negative cash flow while it concentrates on the expansion of its atm network business 
as a result of the company s strategy of continuing expansion and increasing its market share  the company s net losses are expected to increase 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that the company will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from operations in any future period 
if the company cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  it may not be able to meet its debt service or working capital requirements 
the company leases the majority of its atms under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and 
as of december  the company owed  under such capital lease arrangements 
the company anticipates using approximately  to  of the proceeds from the offering defined below to repay a significant portion of the amounts outstanding under such lease arrangements 
at december   the company had contractual capital commitments of approximately million 
the company expects that its capital requirements will increase in the future as it pursues its strategy of expanding its network and increase the number of installed atms 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for the months ending december  will total approximately million  primarily in connection with the acquisition of atms  scheduled capital lease payments on existing lease obligations  and related installation costs 
aggregate capital expenditures for and for such purposes are expected to reach approximately million in its existing markets which assumes the installation of approximately  additional atms over the next two years in accordance with the company s current strategy 
these requirements contemplate both planned expansion in hungary  poland  germany  croatia  the czech republic and certain other european markets 
acquisitions of related businesses in europe and other markets in furtherance of the company s strategy may require additional capital expenditures 
the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the offering on march  in connection with the proposed public offering of usd  or deutsche mark equivalent of the company s senior discount notes due the company believes the net proceeds from the offering  together with its cash flows from operations and remaining proceeds from the equity offering  will be sufficient to fund the company s operating losses  debt service requirements and capital expenditures associated with its expansion plans through the year there can be no assurance  however  that the company will achieve or sustain profitability or generate significant revenues in the future 
it is possible that the company may seek additional equity or debt financing in the future 
the company will have substantial indebtedness after the offering 
as of december   after giving pro forma effect to the offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  the company s total indebtedness would be approximately million  its stockholders equity would be approximately million and the company s total assets would be approximately million 
the indenture limits  but does not prohibit  the company and its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
if an opportunity to consummate a strategic acquisition arises or if one or more new contracts is executed requiring a more rapid installation of atm machines or a significant increase in the number of atm machines in any market area  the company may require substantial additional financing for such purpose and to fund its working capital needs 
such additional financing may be in the form of additional indebtedness which would increase the company s overall leverage 
see selected financial data and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the level of the company s indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the notes  including the following i the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service the notes and its other outstanding indebtedness and to fund adequately its planned capital expenditures and operations  ii the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes may be limited or such financing may be unavailable  iii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow  if any  must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in its business  iv the company s level of indebtedness could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and markets  and v the company s high degree of indebtedness will make it more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and a downturn in its business  thereby making it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations under the notes 
the company must substantially increase its net cash flows in order to meet its debt service obligations  including obligations under the notes  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet such obligations  including its obligations under the notes 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if it otherwise fails to comply with the various covenants under its indebtedness  it would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness of the company 
such defaults could result in a default on the notes and could delay or preclude payments of interest or principal thereon 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents 
the increase of cash and cash equivalents to  at december  from  at december  is due to the expansion of operations in the countries where the company operated in and the new countries in which the company has commenced operations in for the same reasons  restricted cash increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in was primarily attributable to a lease deposit 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  due primarily to the subscription for shares by certain shareholders on march restricted cash decreased from  at december  to  at december   and investment securities increased from none at december  to  at december  investment securities 
the increase in investment securities from  at december  to  at december  was due to the investment of proceeds from the equity offering not currently used in funding the company s operations 
property  plant and equipment 
total property  plant and equipment increased from  at december  to  at december  this increase is due primarily to the installation of atms during the increase in total property  plant and equipment from  at december  to  at december  is due primarily to the installation of atms in deposits for atm leases 
deposits for atm leases increased from  at december  to  at december  as a result of the company s expansion 
lease deposits at december  were  obligations under capital leases 
in connection with the increase of property  plant and equipment  obligations under capital leases increased from  at december  to  at december  to  at december  the majority of the atms installed in and the atms installed in and were financed under capital leases 
trade accounts payable 
trade accounts payable increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase is due primarily to the significant increase in operations in  including approximately  related to atm purchases 
the increase of trade accounts payable from  at december  to  at december  is also attributable to a significant increase in operations in these increases are consistent with the company s projected growth in the earlier years of its operations 
foreign exchange exposure in  of the company s revenues were generated in poland and hungary 
while in hungary the majority of revenues received are to be us dollar denominated  this is not the case in poland  where the majority of revenues are denominated in polish zloty 
however the majority of these contracts are linked either to inflation or the retail price index 
while it remains the case that a significant portion of the company s expenditures are made in or are denominated in us dollars the company is also striving to achieve more of its expenses in local currencies to match its revenues 
the company anticipates that in the future  a substantial portion of the company s assets  including fixed assets  will be denominated in the local currencies of each market 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the deutsche mark  as opposed to the us dollar  on the central european currencies  the company expects that the currencies of the markets where the proceeds from the offering will be used will fluctuate less against the deutsche mark than against the dollar 
accordingly  the company believes that the issuance of deutsche mark denominated debt will provide  in the medium to long term  for a closer matching of assets and liabilities than a dollar denominated issuance would 
inflation and functional currencies in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the oecd over this time period 
however  due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  it is expected that none of these countries will be considered to have a hyper inflationary economy in therefore  since poland will no longer be considered hyper inflationary beginning in and a significant portion of the company s polish subsidiary s revenues and expenses are denominated in zloty  the functional currency of the company s polish subsidiary will now be the zloty 
the functional currency of the company s hungarian subsidiary will continue to be the us dollar 
it is expected that the functional currency of the company s czech subsidiary will also be the us dollar 
germany and france have experienced relatively low and stable inflation rates in recent years 
therefore  the local currencies in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia  like germany and france  has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of the croatian company is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to the factors mentioned above  the company does not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company continually reviews inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries that it operates in 
year compliance the company has made an assessment of the impact of the advent of the year on its systems and operations 
the processing center will require certain upgrades which have been ordered and are scheduled for installation by the fourth quarter most of the atms in the euronet network are not year compliant  and hardware and software upgrades will be installed under contract with company s euronet s atm maintenance vendors 
according to the company s current estimates  the cost will be approximately  per atm  and the required installation will be finished by the end of the company estimates that approximately of its atms will require upgrades for year compliance
