year ended december  and revenues 
the company s total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
revenues from systems sales increased to million in of total revenues from million of total revenues in  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in installations of certain of the company s idxtend and lastword systems 
revenues from maintenance and service fees increased to million in of total revenues from million of total revenues in  an increase of million or 
approximately million of the increase was due to additional maintenance revenue resulting from the continued growth in the company s installed client base 
professional and technical services revenues increased to million in of total revenues from million in of total revenues  an increase of million as a result of the company s increased marketing efforts in that area 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales and services increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the gross profit margin on systems sales and services increased to in from in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase of additional license revenues in the installations of certain of the company s products from its idxtend and lastword systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the additional expenses incurred in were primarily due to an increase in the company s sales and marketing staff 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to the hiring of additional staff to support the development of additional products for the company 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses remained constant at in and as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility until general release of the related products are capitalized 
prior to the merger technological feasibility was determined differently by idx and phamis 
subsequent to the merger the company s determination of technological feasibility for all product development is based on the completion of a working model which has been approved for beta site testing 
historically costs incurred during beta site testing have not been material 
although the company presently expects costs to complete beta site testing in the future to be insignificant  as the company develops products to operate using other technologies as well as more comprehensive clinical systems  the time and effort required to complete beta site testing may be significantly more extensive 
consequently  capitalized software development costs may become material in future reporting periods 
merger and related costs 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded charges of million related to the merger with phamis 
the charges were comprised of transaction costs of million  write offs and adjustments of million of long lived assets  principally capitalized software development costs and equipment  attributable to the elimination of overlapping products and operations  employee termination and related costs of million  and other merger related costs of million  principally related to integration costs incurred during the year and the termination of leases and other contractual obligations 
at december   accounts payable and accrued expenses include accrued costs of million related to the termination of employees  leases and other contractual obligations  substantially all of which will be paid within one year 
the write off of long lived assets is not expected to materially affect amortization or depreciation of future reporting periods 
in addition  the provision for termination of employees  leases and other contractual obligations is not expected to materially affect selling  general or administrative expenses or cash flows of future periods 
management does not expect to incur significant charges related to the merger in future reporting periods 
write off of acquired in process research and development 
on february   the company recorded charges of million related to the acquisition of certain data model technology from medaphis healthcare information technology company for cash of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method 
the charges were expensed as in process research and development in connection with the company s development of a healthcare data model 
year ended december  and revenues 
the company s total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
revenues from systems sales increased to million in of total revenues from million of total revenues in  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in installations of the company s idxtendr the group practice product  formerly known as the idxtend ambulatory suite 
revenues from maintenance and service fees increased to million in of total revenues from million of total revenues in  an increase of million or 
approximately million of the increase was due to additional maintenance revenue resulting from the continued growth in the company s installed client base 
professional and technical services revenues increased approximately million in over as a result of the company s increased marketing efforts in that area 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales and services increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the gross profit margin on systems sales and services increased to in from in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in the installations of the company s idxtendr the group practice product  formerly known as the idxtend ambulatory suite 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in this percentage increase was largely attributable to costs incurred by phamis in related to entry into the international market  corporate headquarters relocation and a business acquisition 
additional expenses incurred in in addition to the phamis related costs were primarily due to the increase in the company s sales and marketing staff over the same period in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to the hiring of additional staff to support the development of additional products for the company 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has funded its operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily from operations  except for real estate owned by certain partnerships and trusts financed through industrial development bonds 
the proceeds from its initial public offering were i distributed to stockholders of the company in connection with the company s prior status as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended  and ii used for general corporate purposes  including working capital purposes  payment of current expenses and strategic transactions  including acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
cash flows from operations are principally comprised of net income and depreciation and are primarily affected by the net effect of the change in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
due to the nature of the company s business  accounts receivable  deferred revenue and accounts payable fluctuate considerably due to  among other things  the length of the sales cycle and installation efforts which are dependent upon the size of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of customers management and general economic conditions 
in general accounts receivable from customers have been collected consistently within days 
cash flows related to investing activities have principally been related to the purchase of computer and office equipment  leasehold improvements  and the purchase and sale of investment grade marketable securities 
the company expects these activities to continue 
investing activities may also include purchases of interests in and acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully complete any such purchases or acquisitions in the future 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  an increase of million from december  the majority of the increase was due to the cash provided by operating activities and proceeds related to the exercise of stock options 
the company has a revolving line of credit with a bank allowing the company to borrow up to million bearing interest at the prime rate 
there were no borrowings as of december  or the company expects that its requirements for office facilities and other office equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate 
the company s operating lease commitments consist primarily of office leasing for the company s operating facilities 
the company plans to continue increasing the number of its professional staff during to meet anticipated sales volume and to support research and development efforts 
to the extent necessary to support increases in staffing  the company intends to obtain additional office space 
the company believes that current operating funds will be sufficient to finance its operating requirements at least through december to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s revenues or income 
income taxes from july  to november   the company was treated for federal and certain state income tax purposes as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as a result  the company s stockholders  rather than the company  were required to pay federal and certain state income taxes based upon the company s earnings whether or not the earnings were distributed to such stockholders 
on november   the company terminated its s corporation status and  accordingly  has become subject to federal and state income taxes 
for purposes of financial statement presentations  the company s financial statements reflect comparative pro forma financial information for as if the company had been fully taxed 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was provided for at the taxable income rate of approximately  which is higher than the historical rate of 
this higher rate is due to a portion of the charges incurred in the merger with phamis  principally transaction costs  which are non deductible for income tax purposes 
for  the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately of pre tax income 
new accounting standards in october   the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  revising certain aspects of sop the sop is effective for transactions occurring in years beginning after december  the company does not expect the sop will materially affect its revenue recognition policies with respect to software license fees which are based upon vendor specific objective information and relate principally to its proprietary systems software which generally requires no significant production  modification or customization 
license revenue  accordingly  is deferred and recognized as customer payments become due based upon specified milestones and due dates including delivery  installation and final systems acceptance 
in  the company will be required to adopt statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
 reporting comprehensive income and disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company believes the adoption of these new accounting standards will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
unlike primary earnings per share  basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities 
diluted earnings per share is similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per share 
backlog at december   the company had total backlog of million  including million attributable to systems sales and million attributable to services 
systems sales backlog consists of fees due under signed contracts which have not yet been recognized as revenues 
service backlog represents contracted software maintenance services  installation fees  and remote computing services fees for a period of months 
at december   the company had total backlog of million including million attributable to systems sales and million attributable to services for multiple years of services 
service backlog represents contracted software maintenance services  installation fees  and remote computing services fees for a period of months or greater at december  of the total backlog of million  the company expects that million will not be fulfilled in the current fiscal year 
year the company has assessed its internal use systems and its currently supported products for possible problems in processing  reporting  displaying and otherwise handling date data containing the year and beyond 
the company believes it has formulated and is in the process of implementing or has completed all plans to make year ready all of its critical internal use systems and all of its currently supported products 
at december   all of the core data bases and data processing functions of the company s significant products were year ready 
the company expects that elements of the company s products other than core databases and data processing functions  such as certain screens and reports  will be year ready in the company has expensed amounts incurred as of december  to make such products year ready  and such amounts have not been material 
the additional costs to make all such remaining systems year ready by the end of will be expensed as incurred  are expected to be incurred in and are not expected to be material 
the company under its maintenance agreements expects to commence delivery to its installed customers of year ready versions of all of its significant products in and to complete most installations of such versions by mid the costs to install year ready versions of the company s products at customer sites  as well as the ability of the company to assist customers in the installation of year ready versions of its products  will depend in part on the readiness  ability and cooperation of customers to install such versions 
any of the company s internal use systems and any of the products supplied by the company to its customers could fail to adequately or properly process  display  report  or otherwise handle date data containing the year and beyond 
any failure of a customer to be ready or able to timely install year ready versions of the company s products could cause significant operational problems for the customer 
further  a failure of the company to timely make available year ready versions of its products  or a failure of the company to timely provide adequate resources to assist its customers in installing year ready versions of its products  could result in claims by customers  which may have a material adverse effect on the business  operations  and future financial results of the company 
factors affecting future results the company s revenues and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the volume and timing of systems sales and installations  and length of sales cycles and installation efforts 
the timing of revenues from systems sales is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle can vary depending upon factors such as the size of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of customer s management  and general economic conditions 
in addition  because revenue is recognized at various points during the installation process  the timing of revenue recognition varies considerably based on a number of factors  including availability of personnel  availability of the customer s resources and complexity of the needs of the customer s organization 
the company s initial contact with a potential customer depends in significant part on the customer s decision to replace  expand  or substantially modify its existing information systems  or modify or add business processes or lines of business 
how and when to implement  replace  expand or substantially modify an information system or modify or add business processes or lines of business  are major decisions for healthcare organizations 
accordingly  the sales cycle for the company s systems is typically three to eighteen months or more from contract execution to completion of installation 
during the sales cycle and the installation cycle  the company expends substantial time  effort and funds preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the system 
because a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of systems sales and installation can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company s future operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  such as customer purchasing patterns  and the timing of new product and service introductions and product upgrade releases 
the company believes that quarterly results of operations will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
there can be no assurance that future period to period fluctuations will continue and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
the company intends to continue to grow in part through acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses or alliances with complementary businesses 
the company s ability to expand successfully through acquisitions or alliances depends on many factors  including the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses and management s ability to effectively integrate and operate the acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses 
there is significant competition for acquisition and alliance opportunities in the healthcare information systems industry  which may intensify due to consolidation in the industry  thereby increasing the costs of capitalizing on such opportunities 
the company competes for acquisition and alliance opportunities with other companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring or aligning with any complementary products  technologies or businesses  or  if acquired or aligned with  that the company will be able to successfully integrate any such products  technologies or businesses into its current business and operations 
the failure to successfully integrate any significant products  technologies or businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
integrating the operations and management of the company and phamis has been and will continue to be a time consuming process  and will require the dedication of management resources  which has and may continue to temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
there can be no assurance that this integration will be completed smoothly or successfully  and the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations or management of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the combined company 
as previously discussed in the section merger and related costs the company has incurred significant merger and related costs 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional unanticipated expenses may be incurred in connection with the continued integration of the business of the company and phamis 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the high technology and healthcare information technology sectors  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the company experiences fluctuations in its stock price related to these general market swings as well as announcements of technological innovations  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  market conditions in the computer software or hardware industries and healthcare reform measures 
these fluctuations could have a significant impact on the future market price of the company s common stock 
as a developer of information systems  the company must anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards and new technological developments 
the market for the company s products is characterized by continued and rapid technological advances in both hardware and software development  requiring ongoing expenditures for research and development and the timely introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
the establishment of standards is largely a function of user acceptance 
therefore  such standards are subject to change 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to respond effectively to technology changes  to migrate its clients to new technologies  to sell additional products to its existing client base and to introduce new products and technologies to meet the evolving needs of its clients in the healthcare information systems market 
the company is currently devoting significant resources toward the development of enhancements to its existing products and the migration of existing products to new hardware and software platforms 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of these products or this migration in a timely fashion or that the company s current or future products will satisfy the needs of the healthcare information systems market 
further  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not adversely affect the company s competitive position or render its products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
any of the company s internal use systems and any of the products supplied by the company to its customers could fail to adequately or properly process  display  report  or otherwise handle date data containing the year and beyond 
any failure of a customer to be ready or able to timely install year ready versions of the company s products could cause significant operational problems for the customer 
further  a failure of the company to timely make available year ready versions of its products  or a failure of the company to timely provide adequate resources to assist its customers in installing year ready versions of its products  could result in claims by customers  which may have a material adverse effect on the business  operations  and future financial results of the company 
the company currently derives a significant percentage of its revenues from sales of financial and administrative healthcare information systems and related services 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
although the company has experienced increasing annual sales  revenues associated with existing products may decline as a result of several factors  including price competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing its current products or any new or enhanced products or maintaining the current pricing for its existing products 
certain of the company s products provide applications that relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
any failure by the company s products to provide accurate  secure and timely information could result in product liability claims against the company by its clients or their affiliates or patients 
the company maintains insurance that it believes is adequate to protect against claims associated with the use of its products  but there can be no assurance that its insurance coverage would adequately cover any claim asserted against the company 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation  as well as diversion of management time and resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to product liability claims  that such claims will not result in liability in excess of its insurance coverage or that the company s insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to the company in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
the success of the company is dependent to a significant degree on its key management  sales and marketing  and technical personnel 
the company believes that its continued future success will also depend upon its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled  managerial  sales and marketing  and technical personnel  including software programmers and systems architects skilled in the computer languages in which the company s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
although the company has been successful to date in attracting and retaining skilled personnel  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to successfully develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
the healthcare industry in the united states is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
the company s products are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
from time to time  certain proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s clients 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for the company s products and services 
the company cannot predict with any certainty what impact  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on its results of operations  financial condition or business 
the us food and drug administration the fda has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of certain computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and has recently indicated it may modify such draft policy or create a new policy 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  the manufacturers of such products could be required  depending on the product  to i register and list their products with the fda  ii notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products  or iii obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending upon the intended use of a device  idx could be required by the fda to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness  or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires such data  idx would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete and there can be no assurance that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  such products would be subject to fdc act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  the company expects that  whether or not the draft is finalized or changed  the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software that is intended for use in healthcare settings 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions such as service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
there can be no assurance that actions taken by the fda to regulate computer software products will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or business 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results
