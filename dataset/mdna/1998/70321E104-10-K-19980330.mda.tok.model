the company intends to report the results of these clinical trials in at the preclinical level  pathogenesis is investigating additional aerosolized antibiotics as follow up drug candidates to tobi  as well as additional oral antibiotics for treating tuberculosis 
the company also has begun collaborating with the cystic fibrosis foundation and university of washington genome center on a two year project to analyze the genetic composition of p 
aeruginosa 
these data may assist pathogenesis researchers in developing new anti pseudomonal therapies
