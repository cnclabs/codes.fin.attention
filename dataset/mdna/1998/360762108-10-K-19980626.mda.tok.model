year the company is undergoing a company wide program of adapting its computer systems and applications for the year substantially all in house developed software has been written to be year compliant 
the company s older systems  some of which are not year compliant  are in the process of being modified or upgraded 
these system upgrades  which include financial  inventory and store point of sale systems are year compliant and are being undertaken primarily to support the company s growth and to take advantage of advanced technologies 
the company believes that it is well positioned to meet the year challenge  primarily through undertakings expected to be completed in the current fiscal year 
year costs have not been material to date and costs over the next months  if separated from related system enhancements  are expected to be less than  finally  the company recognizes that it faces year risks from its various business partners  including vendors and service providers

however  there can be no assurance that the company or its business partners will be completely year compliant on a timely basis 
forward looking statements statements in this document with respect to future sales prospects and expansion plans are forward looking statements and are subject to uncertainties from factors including growth of the industry  the competitive environment  success of the company s existing operations  availability of new store sites and the company s ability to finance new store expansion 
future financial performance greatly depends upon the company s ability to effectively manage a base of profitable stores 
the company plans further significant expansion including to new stores in fiscal and believes that the addition of new stores will continue to be a primary component of the company s ongoing growth 
although the company believes that it has effectively managed its growth in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully continue its planned expansion  that new stores will perform as anticipated or that existing stores will continue to operate at profitable levels 
the company s ability to open and operate new stores profitably will depend upon a number of factors including  but not limited to  availability of suitable locations  negotiation of acceptable lease terms  ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel and the ability to control other operational aspects of the company s growth 
in addition to site selection and lease negotiation  lease renewals are another factor which may impact the company s performance 
although the company does not believe that the termination of any particular lease would have a material adverse effect on its business in that similar locations on comparable terms would be available within the same or in a contiguous market area  results of operations and the company s financial condition would be adversely impacted should the company be unsuccessful in either renewing or relocating a material number of store locations 
the ability of the company to expand and operate stores profitably can also be dependent upon the ability of the company to obtain requisite financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the company at terms acceptable to the company  or at any terms 
the ability of the company to obtain any future financing through additional issuance of stock to the public would be highly dependent upon the market price for the company s securities 
the market price for shares of the company s common stock may be highly volatile depending on various factors such as the general economy  stock market conditions  announcements by the company  its vendors or competitors  announcements of technological innovations or products that may affect the company s business  fluctuations in the company s operating results and performance of the company compared to market expectations 
the interactive entertainment retailing business is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences  pricing and technology 
as the company offers both previously played and new product  it competes with other companies in the market for previously played product and with retailers of new interactive entertainment  many of which are large nationally recognized retail chains 
see item business competition 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to compete successfully in the sale of either new or previously played product 
increased competition  in addition to adversely impacting sales  could also negatively impact product margins  materially impacting operating profits 
in addition  new distribution channels for interactive entertainment  such as on line retailing  internet gaming or other alternate delivery systems may adversely impact future sales of product through retail stores such as the company s 
video games also compete for the consumers dollar with many other forms of entertainment such as sporting events  movies  music and books 
any decrease in video game popularity or shift to other such forms of entertainment would adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
although the company attempts to maintain product mix and inventory levels which will meet consumer demand  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in anticipating and responding to changing consumer preferences 
the ability to operate with the proper merchandise assortment is important to the company s future financial performance 
overstocked  understocked or unbalanced inventories can occur due to factors including misjudgments by the company in assessing product demand or establishing prices  vendor allocations  logistical difficulties or potential limitations of the company s management information systems 
the interactive entertainment industry periodically undergoes technological advances and developments 
failure to appropriately respond to changing technological developments could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
introduction of new hardware systems  or the anticipated introduction of such systems  may affect consumer demand for existing games  hardware and accessories 
further  new games must continually be developed for the new hardware 
neither the development of new hardware or games nor the timing of release of new products is within the control of the company 
the continued successful release of new interactive entertainment product that is accepted by consumers is very important to the company s business  both for increasing sales and encouraging consumers to visit the stores to buy and sell product 
changes in hardware systems may impact the company s business both for previously played product and for new product as consumers determine whether to move to new systems or to continue purchasing games for existing systems 
also  delays in the introduction of new product may adversely affect consumer interest in the overall interactive entertainment product category 
see item business industry overview 
the company s business is highly seasonal with the majority of net sales and net income being generated in the third fiscal quarter which includes the holiday selling season 
accordingly  events  factors or trends which impact that quarter could materially impact full year results 
general economic conditions such as high unemployment  high inflation or a falling stock market which could lead consumers to reduce expenditures during the third fiscal quarter  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial conditions 
seasonal patterns would also intensify the impact of factors such as a shortage of qualified employees or adverse weather conditions 
in addition  any failure by the company to adequately obtain new or previously played inventory or failure by manufacturers to deliver key product either to the marketplace or to the company would be magnified should those events occur during the fiscal third quarter
