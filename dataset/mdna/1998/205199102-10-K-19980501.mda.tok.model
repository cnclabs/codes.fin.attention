for the years ended january  revenues costs and expenses costs of instruction and services selling and promotional general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts amortization of intangible assets income from operations interest income expense  net gain on sale of investment securities income from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal compared with fiscal revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in enrollments at the company s existing learning centers  the opening of four new learning centers in fiscal and the growing popularity of the company s longer programs including associated degree programs 
in addition to the opening of the four new learning centers  the company acquired bec on december   which added two learning centers  one in somerville  ma and the other in methuen  ma 
the number of students attending learning center programs as of the end of the year increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  which was the result of student enrollment growth of 
in fiscal  the ten new learning centers  opened or acquired during the last two fiscal years  collectively contributed of the total enrollment growth and of the total student population growth 
bec accounted for approximately of the population growth  however  did not significantly impact the percentage growth in enrollments due to the acquisition occurring in late december when evaluating the sources of growth  the company views all learning centers opened during the last two fiscal years as new in order to account for the start up period inherent in new center openings 
revenues from ai increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in the number of students 
accounts receivable  both long and short term  increased as compared to the revenues increase of 
the larger percentage increase in accounts receivable as compared to revenues can be attributed to the following when students enroll in clc  accounts receivable are established for the balance of course tuition with a corresponding amount recorded as deferred revenue 
while the accounts receivable balance may be paid at any time during the course  deferred revenue is recognized ratably as tuition revenue over the period of instruction  regardless of when accounts receivable are paid 
since accounts receivable balances increases immediately by the full unpaid tuition amount when students enroll  while tuition revenues are earned ratably over the period of instruction  there will not be a direct correlation between the percentage increases in tuition revenues and correspondingly  deferred revenues and in accounts receivable balances 
this lag effect of revenues to receivables  is further pronounced during the initial operations of a new learning center since tuition revenues will be minimal when compared to corresponding accounts receivable balances 
the lag effect is not as evident for established learning centers which provide a more consistent tuition revenue stream 
additionally  learning centers in their second year of operations those opened in fiscal contribute significantly to the lag effect due to the large levels of growth occurring in year two versus year one of operations 
the following summarizes the actual learning center openings and acquisitions for the last three fiscal years which have contributed to this lag effect

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in enrollments at the company s existing learning centers  the opening of six new learning centers since january  the growing popularity of the company s longer programs including associate degree programs  and growth in ai enrollments

selling and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  primarily as a result of increasing the level of infrastructure needed to support the growth of the business  which includes credit and treasury administration  information systems  and other related personnel costs 
these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in corporate charges for management support and treasury management allocated from a former subsidiary that was divested in may general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal provision for doubtful accounts increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal on september   the doe notified the chicago learning center of their loss of eligibility in the pell grant and ffel programs 
as a result of this loss of title iv funding  the company provided self funded financing options to the existing students that were comparable to what these students would have received under the traditional ffel loan program 
as a result of the increased collection risk associated with the increase in self funding at the chicago learning center  the company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by  during the fourth quarter of fiscal provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this is primarily the result of improved financial aid processing and improved credit and collection activities 
the company realized net interest income of  in fiscal  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal primarily as a result of interest generated by larger invested cash balances and the repayment of debt from proceeds of the initial public offerings 
the income tax rate declined to in fiscal from in fiscal this was due to the fact that prior to may   state taxable income included interest income on amounts owed from a subsidiary  which caused a disproportionately higher state income tax rates 
also contributing to a lower tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal is a capital loss carryforward offsetting the tax effect of the sale of investment securities sold during fiscal seasonality new enrollments in learning center programs tend to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters than in the first and second fiscal quarters because the third and fourth quarters include the times of year traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
the company believes it is less affected by this seasonal pattern than many other educational institutions because it permits students to enroll in and begin learning center programs in any month of the year 
in addition  the impact of seasonality in new enrollments on results of operations has been moderated to some extent by growth in the number of students attending learning center programs  the varying lengths of such programs  and new learning centers opened

for students enrolled in programs of one academic year or less in length  disbursements generally are made in two equal increments  one in the first days following the student s enrollment in a program and the second when the student reaches the midpoint of the program 
for students enrolled in programs greater than one academic year in length  disbursements also are made at the beginning and midpoint of the subsequent academic year
