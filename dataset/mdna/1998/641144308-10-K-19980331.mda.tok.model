item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and include  among others  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
industry background three important industry trends had strong influence on the company s business strategy in i the further development of the internet  intranets and extranets as mission critical business applications in large companies  ii an increased desire on the part of corporations to make information stored in mainframes and midrange computers legacy systems broadly accessible and iii the continued mobilization of users of personal computers on a global basis 
the company uses the term inter networking to describe the technology of global connectivity 
inter networking had its origins in the internet  a world wide network of networks which allows communication between different organizations and locations  each with its own individual network of computers 
with the rapid development of the internet  the breadth of the connectivity industry has quickly expanded beyond proprietary based solutions to web based technologies and other open protocol solutions 
the application of this same inter networking technology within a company on its own computer networks is known as an intranet to distinguish it from the larger public internet 
when companies use inter networking technology for connecting to outside customers and suppliers  it s known as an extranet 
importantly  inter networking is comprised of many different applications which must communicate with one another  each according to its function  and which must follow certain standards or conventions which ensure interoperability 
the personal computer has continued to grow in importance as a tool for facilitating communications  information sharing and group productivity in large companies 
as professional workers have become more and more mobile  there is an accelerated effort to connect personal computers easily and reliably to corporate networks to improve communications and organizational productivity 
as a result  the personal computer has become an important tool to connect workers to shared repositories of information and to other people  regardless of location  network or type of computer 
inter networking also facilitates activities such as mobile computing by allowing users to use and to access more effectively all of a company s computer systems from a remote location 
the specific tasks facilitated by inter networking are numerous and include basic functions such as file transfer and file sharing capabilities  remote data access  login to remote computers and information publishing 
within organizations  pcs must connect not only to other pcs via lans  but also to workstations  servers  minicomputers and mainframes  many of which may run different operating system software and connect to different physical networks 
in addition  more companies are seeking ways to link their computer systems directly with those of vendors  customers and other business partners to enhance the flow of information and reduce expenses 
for a network to function properly  all connected devices must follow rules or protocols that govern access to the network and communication with other devices 
tcp ip is the name of the protocol family used by all inter networking devices and applications because it is an open non proprietary protocol capable of linking disparate environments 
the company was one of the first software vendors to deliver the tcp ip protocol and related applications for the microsoft windows platform 
selling primarily to the business user  netmanage has promoted standards based on its implementation of tcp ip that have been adopted by the industry at large 
the most notable example is the windows sockets  or winsock interface  which is used today by a wide range of windows inter networking software vendors including microsoft 
the company believes that because of the open and interoperable characteristics of inter networking technology  the use of intranets and the software that enables them will continue to grow significantly within organizations  and may emerge as the dominant corporate networking technology replacing other proprietary lan local area network technology from vendors such as novell  inc novell  international business machines ibm and digital equipment corporation digital 
the required software to implement an inter networking solution includes applications for the desktop  the software which transports information over the wires  the servers at the other end and management and development tools to create and administer a network of this type 
additionally  an easy to use  intuitive interface extends the use of these software components to a large  non technical audience and facilitates adoption by such an audience 
the company s vision is to provide inter networking connectivity products that greatly improve the communication between personal computers and legacy systems regardless of where the pcs are located and to deliver products and services that provide an easy to use  standards based infrastructure that ensures businesses run more efficiently  thereby bringing personal computers together with corporate host systems and connecting both to the internet 
as the company continues to deliver on its vision  personal computer users will be able to access corporate data and information more efficiently and more easily than ever before 
products and technology the company s comprehensive suite of products provides organizations with cost effective solutions for connecting people  their computers and their businesses 
the company s products extend the functionality of these organizations technology investments by providing essential services that are not included in desktop and network operating systems 
the result is streamlined communication  reductions in the total cost of ownership and increased productivity throughout an organization 
the company has been a long time proponent of industry standards  and it pursues partnerships and alliances with key industry players 
in addition to promoting technological progress  these alliances help strengthen the company s market insight and lead to improved customer solutions with greater value 
some of the company s strategic partners include microsoft  intel corporation  ibm and at t 
all netmanage products are developed around the following ease of use the company s goal is to create applications for non technical users 
the company s products are designed to be set up on any personal computer in a few minutes and to determine with minimum user intervention all the appropriate settings and installation parameters for each pc s configuration and network 
for corporate users  the cost of training  installation and support can exceed software acquisition costs 
ease of use can reduce such costs 
moreover  ease of use increases product utilization  thereby enhancing product value to the customer 
thus  by reducing costs and enhancing value  the benefit of ease of use is significant to the company s target market 
manageability netmanage offers a fully integrated suite of applications  improving network manageability for system administrators 
for example  customers do not have to buy terminal emulation from one vendor and file transfer from another  each with its own setup  user interface and feature set 
client applications are compatible with custom intranet applications built using netmanage developer toolkits 
the common characteristics of the product suite tend to increase user satisfaction and product utilization 
a well integrated product lowers the cost of ownership and increases product value to the customer 
functionality the depth and completeness of the applications in netmanage products are designed to compete with best of class functionality from specialist vendors in each category 
the value proposition of netmanage s product offerings is enhanced by eliminating multi source product purchases with no compromise on advanced software functionality 
the economic proposition for the customer is enhanced by purchasing software and service from a single vendor 
supportability netmanage recognizes its customers need to reduce continually the cost of ownership associated with personal computer connectivity software 
unlike competitors  who have focused solely on improved manageability to reduce costs  netmanage has also invested in the development of unique support tools 
products are designed with well integrated support tools that reduce the time required to resolve software problems and reduce downtime  significantly enhancing the value of netmanage s product offerings to customers 
adherence to standards the very foundation of the internet is predicated upon the notion that any client can talk to any server  and that all apis application program interfaces and protocols are published as free open standards 
in the corporate computing environment it is impossible to guarantee a common set of software on every client and every server 
netmanage s commitment to open standards insures that the plug and play interoperability that has made internet successful extends to the corporate intranet as well

opsession sdk comprehensive software developer tool that enables programmers to add real time application and workgroup sharing capability  using standard internet technology  to any microsoft windows nt application 
substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide inter networking applications for the microsoft window environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially adversely affected by market developments adverse to windows 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future window developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide on a timely basis products compatible with future windows releases 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling similar or new technology that could render the company s products obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
these developments may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by making potential customers delay their purchases of the company s products 
sales and marketing the company s products are designed to meet the needs of corporate end users  network administrators  system administrators and mis managers 
the company  through its core business unit  targets three key connectivity market segments connecting personal computers to unix r  ibm as r midrange and ibm mainframe systems 
through its emerging technology business unit  the company recently introduced an innovative software application that reduces the length of support calls for organizations of all sizes 
to serve the corporate marketplace  the company is developing more robust applications to provide greater value 
the company believes that the markets for these pc connectivity solutions are large segments where the company has established products  reputation and expertise 
the company is organized to solve the critical network and application needs of corporations in a wide range of industries 
from education and government to finance and manufacturing  the company s products are being used to streamline communications throughout organizations 
the company s products are used by more than  organizations  encompassing more than million users worldwide 
the company s marketing strategy is to establish itself as the preferred supplier of complete personal computer connectivity solutions for corporations 
it has a competitive advantage as a single source supplier for corporations 
the company s products are marketed and sold in the united states and internationally by the company s direct sales force and authorized channel partners 
in the united states  the company combines advertising and promotion with direct sales through a telephone based sales force  assisted by designated personnel specifically assigned to the needs of major accounts 
as part of its continuing strategy to develop multiple distribution channels  the company expects to utilize increasingly indirect channels  such as resellers  particularly value added resellers and systems integrators  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
the company expects that indirect sales will grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues and that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues will adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
the company ships products to resellers and distributors on a purchase order basis  and many of the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any reseller or distributor will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
internationally  the company has sales offices in belgium  france  germany  israel  italy  japan  netherlands  sweden and the united kingdom 
the company also utilizes local distributors internationally 
the company supports the sales activity of these sales offices and distributors in target countries through localization of products and sales material  local training and participation in local trade shows 
in  the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales  including export sales 
the company believes that the potential international markets for its products are substantial  based on the extent to which windows and inter networking products are used internationally 
accordingly  the company localizes its products for use in the native language of target countries 
further  the company has adopted its software to support computing standards that are unique to these countries  such as the nec pc in japan 
the company will continue to target major european and asian countries for additional sales and marketing activity and to expand the use of its local sales offices and israel subsidiary in the support of its international sales 
while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to meet effectively that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s results of operations 
customer support the company s domestic support organization consists of an experienced staff of engineers providing support by telephone from the company s facilities in california and new hampshire 
both telephone support and regular update releases of the software are provided to customers who purchase an annual maintenance agreement 
the sales and the customer support organizations at netmanage work together closely to provide customer satisfaction 
international customers are supported by local distributors who are trained by the company and also are supported by company personnel located in various sales offices 
competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must continue to enhance its current products and develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
several key factors will contribute to the continued growth of the company s marketplace  including the migration from to bit microsoft windows platforms  the proliferation of microsoft windows nt client and server technology  the proliferation of multi user microsoft windows nt systems and the implementation of web based access to corporate mainframe and midrange computer systems and information 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis these or other enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products or cause customers to purchase products from the company s competitors  either situation would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the company competes directly with providers of windows inter networking applications  such as ftp software  hummingbird communications  ltd  attachmate corporation  wall data  inc  ibm  wrq  inc  microsoft and novell  as well as several other companies 
it is imperative that the company s development efforts remain competitive in this marketplace  particularly given that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to do so 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition  and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from current competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with the products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has continued to experience price declines for its products  contributing to lower revenues in as compared to prior periods 
any further material reduction in the price of the company s products would negatively affect gross margins as a percentage of net revenues and would require the company to increase software unit sales in order to maintain net revenues at existing levels 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  seeking indemnification against such infringement or indicating that the company may be interested in obtaining a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of innovation within its industry  factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position within the industry than are the various legal means of protecting its technology 
the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  although there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
employees as of december   the company had a total of full time employees  of whom were engaged in sales  marketing and technical support  in general management  administration and finance  in software development and engineering and in production 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has not experienced any work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good 
the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of the silicon valley and irvine in california and in haifa  israel 
during the latter half of and through  the company experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals 
the company has and will continue to address the issue of attrition 
managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products and expanding both the geographic area of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources 
the company s future operating results will be dependent in part on its ability to attract and retain its employee workforce  train and manage its management and employee base and continue to implement and improve its operating and financial controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such challenges successfully

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annaul report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding expected revenues from newly introduced products  the amount of restructuring charges and the funding of these charges from operations  statements regarding expected fluctuations in operating expenses and capital spending  statements regarding the companys s expectation that indirect sales will increase as a percentage of domestic and total revenues  the company s expectation that it will increase its marketing and sales efforts in major european and asian markets and statements regarding the company s expectations as to the composition of revenues as between core technology products and emerging technology products 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among others  that the markets for the company s products  including chameleon unix r link and chameleon hostlink  could fail to grow at the rate expected by the company and market analysts  or the company will not be able to take advantage of growth in those markets 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company s acquisitions of netsoft and or relay or the company s other organizational changes and plans implemented in will prove successful  that the company s existing products or those of the combined companies will continue to meet with customer acceptance  that the company will not suffer increased competitive pressures  that the buying decisions of the company s corporate customers will not be influenced by the actions of the company s competitors or other market factors or that the company will return to profitability and growth 
additional factors are identified under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview netmanage develops  markets and supports pc connectivity software for the microsoft windows  windows and windows nt platforms and ibm system os and novell  offering applications for unix r  as r and ibm mainframe host systems 
the company also provides remote access  application sharing and help desk technology 
its products are sold and serviced worldwide by the company s direct sales force  international subsidiaries and authorized channel partners 
since the company s inception  revenues from the chameleon family of products have represented substantially all of the company s revenues  and the company expects that revenues from these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of relay  a privately held company  for million in cash 
relay was primarily engaged in the development  marketing and support of network connectivity  file transfer and terminal emulation software 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase 
in connection with the purchase  net intangibles of approximately million were acquired  of which million is reflected as a charge to operations for the write off of in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of network software associates  inc  a california corporation nsa for million in cash 
nsa is a holding company for netsoft  a privately held company specializing in the development  marketing and support of pc to host connectivity software solutions 
as of the date of acquisition  nsa and netsoft have continued as wholly owned subsidiaries of netmanage 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of netsoft from the acquisition date forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisition  net intangibles of approximately million were acquired  of which million was reflected as a charge to operations for the write off of in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
as described in detail under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition acquisitions involve a number of risks  including the integration of the acquired company s operations  personnel and products 
there can be no assurance that the relay and or netsoft integrations  or the integration of any future acquisition  will be accomplished successfully  and the failure to accomplish effectively any of these integrations could have a material adverse effect on netmanage s results of operations and financial condition 
in the third quarter of  the company initiated a plan to restructure its operations worldwide due to business conditions 
the plan is intended to realign the company to focus solely on its core competencies unix r  as r midrange and ibm mainframe connectivity 
in connection with the plan  the company recorded a million charge to operating expenses 
the restructuring charge includes approximately million of estimated employee related expenses for employee terminations  approximately million for the write off of excess equipment and facilities related expenses associated with the consolidation of operations and approximately million for the write off of intangible assets related to certain unprofitable products 
the restructuring plan includes the termination of employees worldwide and the reduction in worldwide office space  which primarily consists of the consolidation of certain domestic technical support and engineering locations 
as of december   the company had incurred costs totaling approximately million related to the restructuring 
the remaining actions are expected to be completed within one year from the date the restructuring plan was initiated 
the company anticipates that these remaining restructuring actions will require the expenditures of approximately million of cash during  which the company expects will be funded by internally generated cash 
in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of maximum information  inc  a california corporation maxinfo  in exchange for approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests during the third quarter of the operations of maxinfo  however  were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and  therefore  the historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition retroactively 
accordingly  the operations of maxinfo from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of age logic  inc  a california corporation age  in exchange for approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and have been restated to combine the results of age and the company 
the company also acquired all of the outstanding stock of syzygy communications  inc  a california corporation syzygy  in exchange for approximately  shares of the company s common stock  in october this transaction was also accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the operations of syzygy  however  were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and  therefore  the historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition retroactively 
accordingly  the operations of syzygy from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during the past year  the company has discontinued several low revenue generating products and focused efforts on controlling costs in order to reduce operating expenses and attempt to return the company to profitability 
as previously discussed  in the third quarter of the company initiated a plan to restructure its operations worldwide and focus on its core competencies 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of the company consolidated its operations into two distinct business groups  each with dedicated development  sales  marketing and support resources 
the core technology business unit products provide the technology to make the connection between personal computers and large corporate computers possible 
these products leverage the strengths and popularity of the internet and offer features to improve network manageability 
core technology products include the company s strongest brands the chameleon family chameleon hostlink  chameleon unix r link  chameleon lt  and the ns portfolio family ns portfolio enterprise  ns portfolio for mainframe  ns portfolio for as r and ns router 
the emerging technology business unit develops products that add value to the core technology product offerings and also target new market segments 
current products include supportnow and opsession  real time software tools that help reduce the length of support phone calls from end users 
for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  the company experienced a significant decline in net revenues and an increase in net loss 
the decline in net revenues primarily reflects the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products  particularly in europe and japan  as well as increased competition and pricing pressures 
while additional revenues resulted from both the netsoft and relay acquisitions  consolidated net revenues also declined as a direct result of these acquisitions as the company was incorporating acquired products into existing product lines  integrating the operations of netmanage and the acquired companies and restructuring the combined companies focus on becoming the premier single source provider of pc to host connectivity 
as a result of these integration efforts  as well as the timing of the acquisitions of netsoft and relay in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  the acquisitions did not contribute significantly to revenue for the year ended december  finally  chameleon hostlink began shipping towards the end of the third quarter of and  therefore  did not contribute significantly to revenues until the fourth quarter of operating expense levels are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
operating expenses  excluding the write off of in process research and development and restructuring charges  have decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  compared to operating expenses are expected to remain relatively constant throughout and will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues as the company integrates both netsoft and relay into its operations and as the company s newly introduced products contribute more significantly to revenue 
while the company will continue to adjust its operations to address these issues  there can be no assurance that net revenues or net income will stabilize or improve in the future

service revenues have been primarily attributable to maintenance agreements associated with licenses 
license fees decreased substantially both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as previously discussed  the decline in license fees was primarily attributable to increased competition and heightened pricing pressures and the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products  particularly in the international marketplace 
further  as discussed above  the timing of the netsoft and relay acquisitions and the release of the company s chameleon hostlink product prevented these events from contributing significantly to revenues during the year ended december  while the company did realize increased revenues on a sequential quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of as a result of the company s recently introduced products  including both chameleon hostlink and unix r link as well as the company s acquisitions  there can be no assurance that revenues will continue to increase or stabilize in the future 
the increase in service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to primarily reflects the decline in the total net revenues base as a result of the aforementioned decline in license fee revenues 
the company has operations worldwide with sales offices located in the united states  europe and japan 
international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was due largely to the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products  particularly in europe and japan  the latter of which accounted for the majority of the company s international revenues during netsoft has historically been successful in marketing and selling its products internationally  and the company is in the process of integrating and streamlining overlapping functions  particularly in europe  to benefit from netsoft s success historically in the international marketplace 
the company is addressing and taking steps with respect to staffing and management  distributor relationships  and product marketing in europe as well as in japan 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished expeditiously or successfully  or that the company will succeed in its attempts to improve its international marketing and sales efforts 
software license fees are generally recognized as revenue upon shipment if there are no  or insignificant  post delivery obligations  and allowances for returns and doubtful accounts are provided based on historical rates of returns and write offs  which have not been material to date 
certain of the company s sales to distributors are under agreements providing rights of returns and price protection on unsold merchandise 
accordingly  the company defers recognition of such sales until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
the company provides ongoing maintenance and support to its customers  generally under annual service agreements 
maintenance and support is comprised of software updates for existing products and telephone support 
service revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of such agreements 
periodically the company has provided training and consulting services to selected customers 
such revenue is recognized as the related services are performed and has not been material to date 
the company does not expect that revenues generated from such training and consulting services will become materially significant in the future 
no customer accounted for more than of net revenues during the years ended december  and gross margin cost of revenues primarily includes royalties paid to third parties for licensed software incorporated into the company s products  costs associated with product packaging  documentation and software duplication and the amortization and writedown of purchased software 
a charge of approximately million is included in cost of revenues for the year ended december   for the amortization and write off of software purchased in early the write off of purchased software primarily resulted from the company s decision during the fourth quarter of to discontinue its chameleonnfs for mac os and xoftware for mac os product lines 
amounts incurred for the amortization and writedown of purchased software in were immaterial 
gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  increased between the years ended december  and primarily as a result of decreased packaging and documentation costs as well as the charge of million for the amortization and writedown of purchased software discussed above 
cost of service revenues through december  has not been material and is not reported separately 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate in the future due to increased price competition  the mix of distribution channels used by the company  the mix of license fee revenues versus service revenues  the mix of products sold and the mix of international versus domestic revenues 
the company typically recognizes higher gross margins on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels and higher gross margins on license fee revenues than on service revenues 
the company expects that indirect sales will grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues and that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues will adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
research and development research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy and travel expenses  as well as fees paid to outside consultants 
the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily the result of cost savings  particularly salaries and benefits  associated with employee attrition and the previously discussed restructuring 
the decline in the total net revenues base resulted in the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared the company expects that r d spending in absolute dollars will remain relatively constant for and  as a percentage of revenues  will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels  acquisitions and licensing of technology 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility is established  which the company defines as a working model and further defines as a beta version of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross product revenue  estimated economic life and changes in technology 
costs that do not qualify for capitalization are charged to r d expense when incurred 
to date  internal software development costs that were eligible for capitalization have not been significant and the company has charged all internal software developments costs to r d expense as incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing s m expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions of sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional expenses and customer service and support costs 
the decrease in s m expenses in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily reflects cost savings related to employee attrition and the restructuring discussed above  and the resulting declines in salaries and benefits  as well as a decline in advertising as the company re evaluated its marketing and selling strategies 
as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  the increase in s m expenses was attributable to the decreased total net revenues base 
the company believes that s m expenses will increase in absolute dollars during as the company implements its marketing and selling strategies  particularly related to advertising and promotion 
the company expects s m expenses as a percentage of total net revenues will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to cost savings related to employee attrition and the previously discussed restructuring 
as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  the increase in g a expenses was attributable to the decreased total net revenue base 
the company believes that g a expenses will remain relatively constant throughout and  as a percentage of revenues  will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels 
write off of in process research and development as previously discussed  in connection with the acquisitions of all of the outstanding shares of nsa and relay during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  the company acquired a total of million of intangible assets 
of this amount  million was reflected as a charge to operations for the write off of in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
this charge is reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased technology from applicom software industries ltd 
and us computer software  inc in management s opinion  neither of these purchased technologies had reached technological feasibility nor had probable alternative future use 
accordingly  these technology purchases  totaling approximately million  were deemed to be in process research and development and were charged to operations for the year ended december  restructuring charge as discussed above  in the third quarter of  the company initiated a plan to restructure its operations worldwide 
in connection with this plan  a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the company s statement of operations for the year ended december  no such charges were incurred for the year ended december  interest income the decline in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the prior year is primarily the result of a decrease in the aggregate cash and investments from million at december  to million at december  the increase in interest income as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to is attributable to the decreased total net revenues base 
equity in income losses of unconsolidated affiliate and unrealized gain on investment in unconsolidated affiliate in december  netvision  ltd  a provider of internet services in israel and an unconsolidated affiliate of the company issued an additional  preferred shares which were sold to tevel israel international communications  ltd tevel  an unrelated party  for million cash in exchange for a one third interest in netvision 
as a result of the issuance and sale of these shares by netvision  the company s ownership interest in netvision decreased from to approximately 
in connection with this transaction  the company recorded an unrealized gain on the sale of stock by netvision of  million  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  benefit for income taxes the company recorded a benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  on a pretax loss of million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the company generating sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax asset  however  could be reduced in the near term if actual future taxable income differs from estimated amounts

license fees decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the decline in license fees was primarily attributable to increased competition  heightened pricing pressures and the general confusion within the marketplace resulting from rapidly changing technology and product introductions  the delayed release of windows nt and the slow adoption of windows in corporate accounts  all of which contributed to delayed buying decisions  particularly by corporate users 
in addition  the decline reflects the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products in the united states and japan in particular and also reflects the inability of the company to realize any significant revenues from its and acquisitions of products and technology 
these factors lead to lower unit volumes as well as lower average prices 
service revenues increased in absolute dollars year over year by approximately and as a percentage of net revenues increased to nearly of total net revenues 
these increases primarily reflect the company s focus on marketing its customer support services domestically in during mid  the company expanded its worldwide operations with new sales offices internationally in europe and japan

no such charges for the amortization and writedown of purchased software were incurred for the year ended december  gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  declined slightly between the years ended december  and  primarily as a result of the decline in the revenue base and the write off discussed above 
cost of service revenues through december  was not material and was not reported separately 
research and development research and development r d expenses consisted primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy and travel expenses  as well as fees paid to outside consultants 
the increase in r d for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily reflects the hiring of product development engineers in the united states and israel during  in part reflecting the high employee attrition experienced in both locations 
sales and marketing sales and marketing s m expenses consisted primarily of salaries and commissions of sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional expenses  and customer service and support costs 
the increase in s m expenses for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  reflects increased costs related to the company s investment in expanding its direct corporate sales and support functions in the united states and increased marketing activities  including advertising  trade show participation and promotions 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to support and improve the company s infrastructure 
the increase as a percentage of net revenues was also attributable to the decreased revenue base 
write off of in process research and development during the year ended december   the company purchased technology from several parties 
the majority of the million fourth quarter charge is attributable to the company s purchases of technology from applicom software industries ltd 
and us computer software  inc in management s opinion  both purchases of technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no probable alternative future use 
accordingly  such amounts were deemed to be in process research and development and were charged to operations for the year ended december  no such expenses were incurred for the year ended december  acquisition costs the company incurred acquisition costs during the year ended december  related to the aforementioned acquisition of maxinfo  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  primarily related to the aforementioned acquisitions of syzygy and age  which were also accounted for as poolings of interests 
acquisition costs consisted primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting and other related expenses 
interest income interest income increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balances during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
provision benefit for income taxes the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately million on a pretax loss of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for income taxes of approximately million on pretax income of approximately million for the year ended december  disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk  liquidity risk and territory risk 
the company mitigates default and liquidity risks by investing in only safe and high credit quality securities and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the company mitigates territory risk by only allowing up to of the portfolio to be placed outside of the united states

the company has established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures in certain european countries 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of short term earnings volatility 
the company does not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding forward contracts at the end of a period are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in interest income and  thus  are recognized in income in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows 
as these forward contracts mature  the realized gains and losses are recorded and are included in net income loss as a component of interest income 
the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend upon the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
the table below provides information as of december  about the company s forward contracts

these forward contracts mature in less than thirty days 
in thousands  except for notional contract average contract rates amount rate forward contracts british pound sterling german deutschemarks french francs belgian francs the unrealized gain loss on the outstanding forward contracts at december  was immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
due to the short term nature of the forward contracts  the fair value at december  was negligible 
the realized gain loss on these contracts as they matured was not material to the consolidated operations of the company 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities since the company s inception  growth has been financed primarily through cash provided by operations and sales of capital stock 
the company s primary financing activities to date consist of its initial and secondary stock offerings and preferred stock issuances  and have aggregated net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the company does not have a bank line of credit or an equipment lease facility  other than those acquired in connection with the netsoft acquisition which are not material to the company 
during the year ended december   the company s aggregate cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments decreased from million to million 
this decrease was due primarily to the acquisition of netsoft and relay in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  reflects the company s operating loss for the year primarily offset by non cash operating charges  such as the write off of in process research and development and depreciation and amortization 
the company s principal investing activities to date have been the purchase of short term and long term investments  purchases of technology  and business acquisitions 
cash expenditures for the acquisitions of businesses amounted to million in the company does not have any specific commitments with regard to future capital expenditures and it is anticipated that such spending will decline 
net cash provided by financing activities in reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company believes that its current cash balances and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company has experienced and expects to experience in future periods significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors including  among others  demand for the company s products  introduction or enhancements of products by the company or its competitors  technological changes in computer networking  market acceptance of new products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  the size and timing of individual orders  mix of international and domestic revenues  mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  seasonality of revenues  quality control of products  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter and particularly in the last month of that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenues shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s operating results and on the company s ability to achieve profitability 
fluctuations in operating results are likely to result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
during  the company initiated a plan to restructure its operations and to focus on its core competencies in unix r  as r midrange and ibm mainframe connectivity 
the company undertook the restructuring in response to business conditions in order to improve the company s future financial performance 
no assurance  however  can be given that the restructuring will be successful  that future operating results will improve  or that the actions undertaken in the restructuring will not disrupt the company s remaining operations 
further  there can be no assurance that additional reorganization of the company s operations will not be required in the future 
acquisitions the company s merger and acquisition transactions  including the acquisitions of netsoft and relay  have been motivated by various factors  including the desire to obtain new technologies  expand and enhance the company s product offerings  attract key personnel and strengthen the company s presence in the international marketplace 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the diversion of management s attention away from day to day operations  difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and personnel such as sales  engineering and customer support  the incorporation of acquired products into existing product lines  the failure to realize anticipated benefits in terms of cost savings and synergies  undisclosed liabilities  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the potential loss of key employees from acquired companies and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
the company and its acquired companies each have different systems and policies and procedures in many operational areas that also must be integrated 
to achieve profitability  the company will need to integrate successfully and streamline overlapping or duplicative functions 
to date  the company s previous acquisitions have not contributed significantly to revenues 
uncertainty in the marketplace or customer hesitation related to acquisitions could negatively affect the company s future revenues and results of operations 
failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired companies with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company regularly evaluates product and technology acquisition opportunities and anticipates that it may make additional acquisitions in the future if it determines that an acquisition would further its corporate strategy 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by the company will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect the company or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the company s business 
if the operations of an acquired company or business do not meet the company s expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
product development and competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
particularly over the past year  many customers have delayed purchase decisions due to the confusion in the marketplace relating to rapidly changing technology and product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must continue to enhance its current products and to develop  introduce successfully and market new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis these or other enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products or cause customers to purchase products from the company s competitors  either situation would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from its current and new competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with the products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has recently experienced price declines for its products  contributing to lower revenues 
any further material reduction in the price of the company s products would require the company to increase unit sales in order to maintain revenues at existing levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using tcp ip or other technology that could render obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
these developments may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by causing potential customers to delay their purchases of the company s products 
substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide inter networking applications for the microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially adversely affected by market developments adverse to windows 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future windows developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide products compatible with future windows releases on a timely basis 
marketing and distribution as part of its strategy to develop multiple distribution channels  the company expects to increase its use of indirect distribution channels such as resellers  particularly value added resellers and system integrators  in addition to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
the company expects that indirect sales will grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues and that any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues will adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively and will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
the company ships products to resellers and distributors on a purchase order basis  and many of the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any reseller or distributor will continue to represent the company s products  and the inability to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  seeking indemnification against such infringement or indicating that the company may be interested in obtaining a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
the company believes that  due to the rapid pace of innovation within its industry  factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position within the industry than are the various legal means of protecting its technology 
the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others  although there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
global market risks the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales during the year ended december  while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to effectively meet that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s results of operations 
employee retention the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of the silicon valley and irvine in california and in haifa  israel 
during the latter half of and through  the company experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals 
the company has and will continue to address the issue of attrition 
managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products and expanding both the geographic area of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources 
the company s future operating results will be dependent in part on its ability to attract and retain its employee workforce  train and manage its management and employee base  and continue to implement and improve its operating and financial controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such challenges successfully 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches
