in fiscal  all markets reported local currency sales increases with strong performances in thailand  korea  taiwan  singapore  new zealand  and malaysia 
continued strengthening of the dollar against the yen and continued economic uncertainty will most likely have an adverse effect on the future financial performance of the company in this region

ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is an additional measure of operating performance used by management 
ebitda  like operating income  does not include the effects of interest and taxes and additionally excludes the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization on current earnings 
while the components of ebitda may vary from company to company  the company excludes its minority interest adjustment  all depreciation charges related to property  plant and equipment and all amortization charges including amortization of goodwill  purchased royalty rights  leasehold improvements and other intangible assets 
these components of operating income do not necessarily result in a capital requirement in the current period  and  in the opinion of management  many of the underlying assets  both tangible and intangible  create value for the company by supporting the global recognition of brand names and product innovation and by consistently producing quality products for the company s customers and consumers 
the company considers this measure useful in analyzing its results  however  it is not intended to replace  or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these rates principally reflect the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was attributable to tax planning initiatives  a relative change in the mix of earnings from higher tax countries such as japan to lower tax countries  the effect of a reduction in the statutory rate in the united kingdom and the effect of united states federal tax regulations 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal and fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in profits in lower taxed countries  the lessened impact of a relatively higher japanese rate and the reduced relative negative impact of a stockholder s rights to receive certain us royalty payments by reason of the company s purchase of those rights in november liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds have historically been cash flow from operations and borrowings under uncommitted and committed credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad

in july  the company entered into a five year million committed revolving credit facility

net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal increase relates to increased earnings  particularly before depreciation and amortization  partially offset by operating assets increasing more than operating liabilities 
operating asset increases are attributable primarily to increased inventories and accounts receivable  due in part to the acquisitions of aveda and sassaby

for fiscal  the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to the company s increased profitability  reduced inventory levels  and an increase in other accrued liabilities

financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal primarily from long term borrowings  partially offset by dividend payments

the current ratio of the company was for fiscal and the company expects to commence payments of a contingent earn out relating to the acquisition of bobbi brown in march  the amount of which will be dependent upon certain results of operations of bobbi brown during the and calendar years 
the company is completing construction of a state of the art warehouse and distribution center in lachen  switzerland  which has been designed to accommodate the company s projected growth 
although the distribution center is operational  additional costs to complete are anticipated 
these costs are not expected to be material 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflects the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  store and counter construction and information technology advancements  as well as incremental capital spending by acquired companies 
fiscal spending included costs related to the construction of the lachen distribution center and the purchase of a facility in blaine  minnesota 
dividends declared were million in fiscal  including million paid july   compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects the inclusion in fiscal of a special cash dividend in the aggregate amount of million payable to the then holders of certain shares in a subsidiary  a dividend payable to the then holders of the company s common stock  consisting of interests in corporations and partnerships holding certain assets of the company  which were unrelated to the company s core business  and million in cash 
the aggregate fair value of the assets in such corporations and partnerships was million 
these fiscal dividends were declared and paid immediately prior to the recapitalization described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  dividends also include amounts paid on the company s participating class i preferred stock  which stock ceased to be outstanding after the company completed the recapitalization 
commencing with the quarter ended march   the company has declared quarterly dividends at the rate of 
per share on its class a common stock and class b common stock 
in fiscal  and  dividends declared on such common stock totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with its identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the company s costs and on the cash flows which it receives from its foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of these exposures are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
the company also enters into purchased foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
any gains realized on such options that qualify as hedges are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
premiums on foreign currency options are amortized over the period being hedged 
foreign currency transactions which do not qualify as hedges are marked to market on a current basis with gains and losses recognized through income and reflected in operating expenses 
in addition  any previously deferred gains and losses on hedges which are terminated prior to the transaction date are recognized in current income when the hedge is terminated 
as a matter of policy  the company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and the company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of loss is remote and in any event would be immaterial 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding months and costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to the company s financial results 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   the company had foreign currency contracts in the form of purchased currency options and forward exchange contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in these contracts are principally the belgian franc  japanese yen  german mark  swiss franc  uk pound  spanish peseta and italian lira 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
these swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
amounts currently due to or from interest swap counterparties are recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in other accrued liabilities 
at june  the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional principal amount of million 
the effects of inflation have not been significant to the overall operating results of the company in recent years 
generally  the company has been able to increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 
the company believes that cash on hand  internally generated cash flow  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures both on a near term and long term basis 
derivative financial instruments the company conducts business in many foreign currencies 
as a result  it is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the effects that foreign exchange rate movements of these currencies have on the company s costs and on the cash flows which it receives from its foreign subsidiaries 
the company believes that currently it has no other material market risk exposures 
the company addresses its risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  and accordingly categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
see note financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses a value at risk model to assess the market risk of its derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
the company estimates value at risk across all of its derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the company s measured value at risk from holding such derivative instruments  using a variance co variance model with a percent confidence level  assuming normal market conditions at june  was immaterial 
the company s calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
the company believes however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of currency movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
in addition  the maximum exposure associated with the purchase of options is limited to the premiums paid  which are recognized against income over the period being hedged 
year the company has developed a comprehensive plan to address year issues 
the plan addresses three main areas a information systems  b embedded chips  and c supply chain readiness including customers as well as inventory and non inventory suppliers 
to oversee the process  the company has established a steering committee comprised of senior executives from its various business units around the world and chaired by the company s president and chief operating officer 
the committee reports regularly to the board of directors and the audit committee 
the company has identified potential deficiencies related to year in its information systems  both hardware and software  and is in the process of addressing them through upgrades and other remediation 
the company expects to complete remediation and testing of its internal systems in the summer of in respect of other equipment with date sensitive operating controls such as manufacturing equipment  elevators  hvac  security and other similar systems  the company is in the process of identifying those items which may require remediation or replacement 
the company expects to complete remediation or replacement and testing of these in the summer of as for third parties  the company is in the process of identifying and contacting suppliers  both inventory and non inventory  as well as customers 
this process includes the solicitation of written responses to questionnaires and or meetings with certain of such third parties 
the company expects to have a better understanding of the year readiness of these third parties over the next several months 
based upon the company s current estimates  incremental out of pocket costs of its year program are expected to be immaterial 
these costs are expected to be incurred primarily in fiscal and include third party consultants  remediation of existing computer software and replacement and remediation of embedded chips 
such costs do not include internal management time and the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
at this stage of the process  the company believes that it is difficult to specifically identify the cause of the most reasonable worst case year scenario 
as with all manufacturers and distributors of products such as those sold by the company  a reasonable worst case scenario would be the result of failures of third parties including  without limitation  governmental entities and entities with which the company has no direct involvement that continue for more than several days in various geographic areas where the company s products are produced or sold at retail or in areas from which the company s raw materials and components are sourced 
in connection with the production of products and supplies of raw materials and components  the company is considering various contingency plans 
continuing failures in key geographic areas in the united states and in certain european and asian countries that limit consumers ability to shop  would most likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the extent of such lost revenue cannot be estimated at this time  however  the company is considering contingency plans to limit  to the extent possible  the effect of such lost revenue on the company s result of operations 
any such plans would necessarily be limited to matters over which the company can reasonably control 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while the company anticipates continuity of its business activities  that continuity will be dependent upon its ability  and the ability of third parties with whom the company relies on directly  or indirectly  to be year compliant 
euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which the company conducts business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies will be fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies being removed from circulation between january  and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities as well as individuals may pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euro or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there is a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to use the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  the company expects to be euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euro as requested by vendors and suppliers  respectively by january  in the affected countries 
full conversion of all affected country operations to euro is expected to be completed by the time national currencies are removed from circulation 
phased conversion to the euro is currently underway and the effects on revenues  costs and various business strategies are being assessed 
the cost of software and business process conversion is not expected to be material 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this statement requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if certain conditions are met where the derivative instrument has been designated as a fair value hedge  the hedged item may also be marked to market through earnings thus creating an offset 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument may be recorded in comprehensive income
