overview the company designs  manufactures  markets and supports video post production tools for high quality real time video processing 
the company s products are used to capture  compress and store and edit video and to perform a variety of video manipulation functions  including the addition of special effects  graphics and titles to multiple streams of live or previously recorded video material 
pinnacle s strategy is to leverage its existing market and technological position to continue to provide innovative  real time  computer based solutions for three video post production markets which the company characterizes as the broadcast  desktop and the consumer video markets 
broadcast market the broadcast market generally requires very high technical performance such as real time bit processing  control of multiple channels of live video and specialized filtering and interpolation 
from the company s inception in until  substantially all of the company s revenues were derived from the sale of products into the broadcast market 
the primary broadcast products sold during fiscal were the prizm and flashfile family of products 
in june  the company commenced shipment of dvextreme and lightning  two windows nt based products designed to address the markets previously addressed by prizm and flashfile  respectively 
in april  the company completed the acquisition of the deko titling and character generation product line from digital graphix deko acquisition and has since enhanced and expanded that product line 
substantially all of the broadcast revenue in fiscal came from the sale of dvetreme  lightning and deko products 
in june  the company commenced shipment of alladinpro  a new high performance windows nt based digital video effects system designed for live and on line applications 
these four product families  dvextreme  lightning  deko and alladinpro comprise the company s suite of high performance real time windows nt based products designed for on air  broadcast and high end  post production applications 
the broadcast market accounted for approximately   and of net sales in the years ended june   and  respectively 
desktop market the company s desktop products are designed to provide high quality video capture  compression decompression  editing  and real time video manipulation capabilities for computer based video post production systems 
they are generally offered at significantly lower price points than traditional editing suites and are integrated into the computer by a value added reseller  an oem  or the end user 
the company s first desktop product was the alladin  which commenced shipment in june the company expanded its desktop product line with the introduction of genie in june in august the company acquired the mirovideo desktop product lines and during fiscal the company introduced additional new desktop products 
in fiscal the company had two general classes of desktop products digital video effects products  which include the alladin and genie families  and video capture and editing products  which include the reeltime  mirovideo dc  mirovideo dc and mirovideo dv families 
the desktop market accounted for approximately  and of net sales in the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
consumer market the company s consumer products provide complete video editing solutions which allow consumers to edit their home videos using their home pc  camcorder and vcr 
the company s consumer products are sold at lower price points than the company s other products and are sold as both software packages and as computer peripheral products 
the company entered the consumer video editing market by acquiring the videodirector product line from gold disk  inc in june  and commenced shipment of its first internally developed consumer editing product  the videodirector studio  in march in june the company commenced shipment of studio  which expands the capabilities of and replaces videodirector studio in august the company acquired the mirovideo consumer product lines

in september  the company issued  shares of common stock in consideration of such earnout payment  which will be recorded as goodwill and amortized over nine years beginning september  pinnacle distributes and sells its products to end users through the combination of independent domestic and international dealers  retail distributors  oems and  to a lesser extent  a direct sales force 
sales to dealers  distributors and oems are generally at a discount to the published list prices 
generally  products sold to oems are integrated into systems sold by the oems to their customers 
the amount of discount  and consequently the company s gross profit  varies depending on the product and the channel of distribution through which it is sold  the volume of product purchased and other factors 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses engineering and product development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss comparison of years ended june  and net sales 
the company s net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in sales of all three product groups broadcast  desktop and consumer 
the increase in consumer sales resulted from sales of products acquired in the miro acquisition and sales of the videodirector studio and studio  which commenced shipment in march and june  respectively

during the year ended june   the company recorded an in process research and development charge of approximately million relating to the miro acquisition 
during the year ended june   the company recorded an in process research and development charge of approximately million relating to the deko acquistion 
to determine the value of the software in the development stage for the acquisition  the company considered  among other factors  the stage of development of each project  the time and resources needed to complete each project  expected income and associated risk 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and thereby achieving technological feasibility and risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
the analysis was based on past experience of miro  including a product lifespan of approximately three years  continued revenue growth and profit margins ranging from to 
in addition  the analysis included a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of sales resulting from increased sales and administrative efficiencies due to and increased volume and reduced combined overhead 
a discount rate of was applied to all software projects in process 
the analysis did not include any increase in sales of non acquired product that may result from a larger sales force and greater market presence  particularly in europe

inflationary impact since the inception of operations  inflation has not significantly affected the operations results of the company 
however  inflation and changing interest rates have had a significant effect on the economy in general and therefore could affect the operating results of the company in the future

the cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was the result of the net loss of million as adjusted by the acquired research and development charge of million  depreciation and amortization of million and tax benefit from exercise of common stock option of million  partially offset by net increases in the components of working capital  primarily account receivable 
in fiscal cash used by operating activities was the result of the net loss as adjusted by the acquired research and development  an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  depreciation and amortization  and a loss on disposal of property and equipment  partially offset by net decreases in the components of working capital  primarily inventory 
during fiscal  million was invested in property and equipment  compared to million in fiscal the high level of expenditure for the fiscal was primarily related to leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment for the facility in mountain view  california 
the company expects to continue to purchase property and equipment at an increased rate from prior year levels 
such capital expenditures will be financed from working capital 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company could purchase up to  shares of its common stock on the open market 
the company had repurchased and retired approximately  shares of its common stock in the open market at an average purchase price of for a total cost of  until the stock repurchase program was terminated in october in april  the company purchased the deko product line and technology  including the typedeko product from digital graphix 
the company paid million in cash and assumed liabilities of  to consummate the transaction 
see overview 
in august  the company completed the miro acquisition 
in the purchase  the company paid approximately million in cash  issued  shares of common stock valued at million  and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
in september  the company also paid to miro additional consideration in the form of  additional shares of common stock based on the achievement of certain revenue and profitability objectives during the twelve months following the miro acquisition 
see overview 
as of june   the company had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
the company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support the company s working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors affecting operating results significant fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have in the past varied significantly and are expected to vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of significant orders from and shipments to major oem customers  in particular avid  the timing and market acceptance of new products or technological advances by the company and its competitors  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products  such as alladinpro  reeltime  dv  dc and studio  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  the accuracy of the company s and resellers forecasts of end user demand  the timing and amount of any inventory write downs  the ability of the company to obtain sufficient supplies of the major subassemblies used in its products from its subcontractors  the ability of the company and its subcontractors to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for the company s products  the timing and level of product returns  particularly from the consumer distribution channels  foreign currency fluctuations  costs associated with the acquisition of other companies  businesses or products  the ability of the company to integrate acquired companies  businesses or products  such as the product lines acquired in the miro acquisition  and general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
the company s operating expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income would be disproportionately affected by a shortfall in net sales 
the company also experiences significant fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations  the timing of major trade shows and the sale of consumer products in anticipation of the holiday season 
sales usually slow down during the summer months of july and august  especially in europe 
the company attends a number of annual trade shows which can influence the order pattern of products  including the nab convention held in april  the ibc convention held in september and the comdex exhibition held in november 
due to these factors and the potential quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
risks associated with potential future acquisitions 
in august  the company completed the miro acquisition 
in addition  the company purchased the deko product line and technology from digital graphix  inc in april and the videodirector product line from gold disk  inc in june future acquisitions by the company may result in the diversion of management s attention from the day to day operations of the company s business and may include numerous other risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  products and personnel of the acquired companies 
future acquisitions by the company have the potential to result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company management frequently evaluates the strategic opportunities available to it and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
risks associated with the consumer market 
the company entered the consumer market with the purchase of the videodirector product line in june the company began shipping its first internally developed consumer product  the videodirector studio  in march and began shipping a successor product  the studio in june in addition  in connection with the miro acquisition in august  the company acquired certain of miro s consumer products  as well as miro s european sales organization 
the company anticipates expending considerable resources to develop  market and sell products into the consumer market 
the company has limited experience marketing and selling products through the consumer distribution channels 
to be successful in this market  the company must establish and maintain effective consumer distribution channels including distributors  electronic retail stores and telephone and internet orders 
because many of the company s consumer products must be used with a personal computer  a camcorder and a vcr  none of which is supplied by the company  consumer acceptance will be adversely affected to the extent end users experience difficulties installing the company s products with these other electronic components 
in addition  the company faces additional or increased risks associated with inventory obsolescence and inventory returns as products sold into the consumer channel typically provide stock rotation and price protection rights to the reseller 
there can be no assurance that the consumer video market will continue to develop  or that the company can successfully compete against current and future competitors in this market 
the failure of the company to successfully develop  introduce and sell products in this market could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see dependence on resellers  absence of direct sales force  expansion of distribution channels 
concentration of sales to oems 
the company has been highly dependent on sales of its alladin and genie products to oems  in particular avid 
sales to avid accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  of sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal though this concentration has lessened during the last two fiscal years  it still subjects the company to a number of risks  in particular the risk that its operating results will vary on a quarter to quarter basis as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of oem customers  in particular avid 
the company s results of operations have in the past and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize  by deferrals or cancellations of orders  or if overall oem demand were to decline 
for example  since sales to avid began in fiscal  quarterly sales to avid have fluctuated substantially from a high of million to a low of million  and the company anticipates that such fluctuations may continue 
if sales to oem customers  in particular avid  were to decrease  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
technological change and obsolescence  risks associated with development and introduction of new products 
the video post production equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the development of new  technologically advanced products incorporating proprietary hardware and software is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the company is critically dependent on the successful introduction  market acceptance  manufacture and sale of new products that offer its customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
these products include those that the company has recently introduced  such as dv and reeltime  which began shipping in the third fiscal quarter of  as well as products that began shipping in the fourth fiscal quarter of  such as alladinpro  studio and mirovideo dc once a new product is developed  the company must rapidly commence volume production  a process that requires accurate forecasting of customer requirements and the attainment of acceptable manufacturing costs 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires the company to manage the transition from older  displaced products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
for example  the introduction of dvextreme and lightning has resulted in a significant decline in sales of prizm and flashfile and a write down of inventory 
the company has experienced delays in the shipment of new products in the past  and these delays adversely affected sales of existing products and results of operations 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of the company to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain significant market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
in addition  as is typical with any new product introduction  quality and reliability problems may arise and any such problems could result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service warranty costs and a limitation on market acceptance of the product 
competition 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company anticipates increased competition in each of the broadcast  desktop and consumer video production markets  particularly since the industry is undergoing a period of consolidation 
competition for the company s broadcast products is generally based on product performance  breadth of product line  service and support  market presence and price 
the company s competitors in the broadcast market include companies with substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than the company 
in addition  these competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of the company and some offer a wide variety of video equipment which can be bundled in certain large system sales 
in the desktop market  the company faces competition from traditional video suppliers  providers of desktop editing solutions  video software applications  and others 
in addition  suppliers of video manipulation software may develop products which compete directly with those of the company 
the consumer market in which videodirector studio  studio and certain mirovideo products compete is an emerging market and the sources of competition are not yet well defined 
there are several established video companies that are currently offering products or solutions that compete directly or indirectly with the company s consumer products by providing some or all of the same features and video editing capabilities 
in addition  the company expects that existing manufacturers and new market entrants will develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products that may compete directly with the company s consumer products 
the company expects that potential competition in this market is likely to come from existing video editing companies  software application companies  or new entrants into the market  many of which have the financial resources  marketing and technical ability to develop products for the consumer video market 
increased competition in any of these markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on contract manufacturers and single or limited source suppliers 
the company relies on subcontractors to manufacture its consumer products and the major subassemblies of its broadcast and desktop products 
the company and its manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of components and parts used in the company s products  including certain key integrated circuits 
the company s strategy to rely on subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including the loss of control over the manufacturing process  the potential absence of adequate capacity  potential delays in lead times  the unavailability of certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs 
the company and its subcontractors have in the past experienced delays in receiving adequate supplies of sole source components 
in the event that any significant subcontractor or single or limited source suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these subassemblies or provide critical components in required volumes  the company would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign its products with different components 
no assurance can be given that any additional sources would be available to the company or that product redesign would be feasible on a timely basis 
also  because of the reliance on these single or limited source components  the company may be subject to increases in component costs  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business financial condition and results of operations 
any extended interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products  subassemblies or components manufactured by third party subcontractors or suppliers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on resellers  absence of direct sales force  expansion of distribution channels 
the company distributes its products primarily through a network of dealers  oems  retailers and other resellers 
accordingly  the company is dependent upon these resellers to assist in promoting market acceptance of its products 
there can be no assurance that these dealers  oems and retailers will devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to the company 
the company s dealers and retailers are generally not contractually committed to make future purchases of the company s products and therefore could discontinue carrying the company s products in favor of a competitor s product or for any other reason 
because the company sells a significant portion of its products through dealers and retailers  it is difficult to ascertain current demand for existing products and anticipated demand for newly introduced products such as dv  reeltime  alladinpro  dc and studio  regardless of the level of dealer inventory for the company s products 
moreover  initial orders for a new product may be caused by the interest of dealers in having the latest product on hand for potential future sale to end users 
as a result  initial stocking orders for a new product  such as dv  reeltime  alladinpro  dc and studio may not be indicative of long term end user demand 
in addition  the company is dependent upon the continued viability and financial stability of these dealers and retailers  some of which are small organizations with limited capital 
the company believes that its future growth and success will continue to depend in large part upon its dealer and retail channels 
accordingly  if a significant number of its dealers and or retailers were to experience financial difficulties  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote  sell or pay for the company s products  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
recently  as the company has increased its consumer products offerings  the company has expanded its distribution network to include several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
the company also sells its consumer products directly to some retailers 
the company s agreements with retailers and distributors generally obligate the company to provide price protection to such retailers and distributors and  while the agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will not be faced with significant product returns or price protection obligations 
in the event the company experiences significant product returns or price protection obligations  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the distributors or retailers will continue to stock and sell the company s consumer products 
moreover  distribution channels for consumer retail products have been characterized by rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors 
the termination of one or more of the company s relationships with retailers or retail distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that the company successfully establishes and expands its retail distribution channels  its agreements or arrangements are unlikely to be exclusive and retailers and retail distributors are likely to carry competing products 
any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in part upon the continued service of its senior management and key technical personnel 
only one of the company s senior management or key technical personnel is bound by an employment agreement and none are the subject of key man life insurance 
the company s success is also dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel 
significant competition exists for such personnel and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical and managerial employees or that it will be able to attract  assimilate and retain such other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as may be required in the future 
there can be no assurance that employees will not leave the company and subsequently compete against the company  or that contractors will not perform services for competitors of the company 
if the company is unable to retain key personnel  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect its proprietary technology 
in addition  the company generally enters into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees and oem customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary technology 
the company currently holds two united states patents covering certain aspects of its technologies for digital video effects and has an application pending for a third patent 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent application or any future patent applications will be allowed or that issued patents will provide the company with a competitive advantage 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that the company can meaningfully protect its intellectual property 
a failure by the company to meaningfully protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of third party claims of infringement 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to the company  to protect its trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by the company  or to defend the company against claimed infringement 
any such litigation could be costly and may result in a diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determination in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the course of its business  the company has in the past and may in the future receive communications asserting that the company s products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
the company s policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and to negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of its products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that such communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
international sales risks 
sales of the company s products outside of north america represented approximately  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net sales  particularly in light of it s increased european sales as a result of the miro acquisition and the addition of the miro european sales channel 
the company makes foreign currency denominated sales in many  primarily european  countries  exposing itself to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
although the dollar amount of such foreign currency denominated sales was nominal during fiscal  it increased subtantially during fiscal  especially for sales of consumer and desktop products into europe 
in fiscal any beyond  the company expects that a majority of its european sales will be denominated in local foreign currency 
international sales and operations may also be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  generally longer receivable collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risks for pinnacle systems 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
there are two other related issues which could also lead to incorrect calculations or failures  i some systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as  and ii the year is a leap year 
to address these year issues with its internal systems  the company has initiated a program  which is designed to deal with the company s internal management information systems 
assessment and remediation are proceeding in parallel and the company currently plans to have changes to those management and critical systems completed and tested by mid these activities are intended to encompass all major categories of systems used by the company  including manufacturing  sales and financial systems 
the company is also working with key suppliers of products and services to determine that their operations and products are year capable  or to monitor their progress toward year capability 
in addition  the company has begun internal discussions concerning contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems and with suppliers and other third parties 
it is expected that assessment  remediation and contingency planning activities will be on going throughout and with the goal of appropriately resolving all material internal systems and third party issues 
the company also has begun a program to assess the capability of its products to handle the year to assist customers in evaluating their year issues  the company in currently assessing the capability of its current products and products no longer being produced  to handle the year  and expects to complete that assessment by early products will be assigned to one of the four following categories year compliant  year compliant with minor issues year non compliant  no evaluation done will not test 
testing has not yet been completed  but based on preliminary tests  the company believes that all current products shipping  which run under microsoft windows nt or windows  will be year compliant 
testing of older products which are no longer shipping has only recently been initiated and the company considers it likely that some older products may not be year compliant 
except as implied in any limited product warranty  the company does not believe it is legally responsible for costs incurred by customers related to ensuring their year capability 
nevertheless  the company is incurring various costs to provide customer support and customer satisfaction services regarding year issues and it is anticipated that these expenditures will continue through and thereafter 
as used by pinnacle systems  year compliant means that when used properly and in conformity with the product information provided by the company  and when used with year compliant computer systems  the product will accurately store  display  process  provide  and or receive data from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  including leap year calculations  provided that all other technology used in combination with the pinnacle systems product properly exchanges date data with the pinnacle systems product 
the costs incurred to date related to these programs have not been material 
the cost which will be incurred by the company regarding the implementation of year compliant internal information systems  testing of current or older products for year compliance  and answering and responding to customer requests related to year issues  including both incremental spending and redeployed resources  is currently not expected to exceed  the total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
in some instances  the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal course of business is being accelerated to also afford a solution to year capability issues 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the projects and is subject to change as the project progress 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
no assurance that company can manage growth 
the company has in the past experienced rapid growth 
for example  net sales in fiscal were million compared to million and fiscal the company anticipates that it may grow at a rapid pace in the future 
such growth could cause significant strain on management and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to improve and expand its management  operational and financial systems and controls 
as a result of recent acquisitions  the company has increased the number of its employees substantially  which increases the difficulty in managing the company  particularly as employees are now geographically dispersed in north america and europe 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s ability to retain key personnel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected
