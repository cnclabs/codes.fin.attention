legislative and regulatory issues legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which has adversely impacted the company 
the changes have limited  and are expected to continue to limit  payment increases under these programs 
also  the timing of payments made under the medicare and medicaid programs is subject to regulatory action and governmental budgetary constraints  in recent years  the time period between submission of claims and payment has increased 
implementation of the company s strategy to expand specialty medical services to independent providers should reduce the impact of changes in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs on the company as a whole 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings and interpretations which may further affect payments made under those programs 
further  the federal and state governments may reduce the funds available under those programs in the future or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of eldercare centers or other providers 
there can be no assurances that adjustments from medicare or medicaid audits will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
pursuant to the balanced budget act commencing with cost reporting periods beginning on july   pps began to be phased in for skilled nursing facilities at a per diem rate for all covered part a skilled nursing facility services as well as many services for which payment may be made under part when a beneficiary who is a resident of a skilled nursing facility receives covered skilled nursing facility care 
the consolidated per diem rate is adjusted based upon the rug 
in addition to covering skilled nursing facility services  this consolidated payment will also cover rehabilitation and non rehabilitation ancillary services 
physician services  certain nurse practitioner and physician assistant services  among others  are not included in the per diem rate 
for the first three cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   the per diem rate will be based on a blend of a facility specific rate and a federal per diem rate 
in subsequent periods  and for facilities first receiving payments for medicare services on or after october   the federal per diem rate will be used without any facility specific blending 
the balanced budget act also required consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities 
under the balanced budget act  the skilled nursing facility must submit all medicare claims for part a and part b services received by its residents with the exception of physician  nursing  physician assistant and certain related services  even if such services were provided by outside suppliers 
medicare will pay the skilled nursing facilities directly for all services on the consolidated bill and outside suppliers of services to residents of the skilled nursing facilities must collect payment from the skilled nursing facility 
although consolidated billing was scheduled to begin july  for all services  it has been delayed until further notice for beneficiaries in a medicare part a stay in a skilled nursing facility not yet using pps and for the medicare part b stay 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide skilled nursing services at a cost below the established medicare level 
effective april   regulations were adopted by the health care financing administration  which revise the methodology for determining the reasonable cost for contract therapy services  including physical therapy  respiratory therapy  occupational therapy and speech language pathology 
under the regulations  the reasonable costs for contract therapy services are limited to geographically adjusted salary equivalency guidelines 
however  the revised salary equivalency guidelines will no longer apply when the pps system applicable to the particular setting for contract therapy services eg skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies  etc 
goes into effect 
the balanced budget act also repealed the boren amendment federal payment standard for medicaid payments to medicaid nursing facilities effective october  the boren amendment required medicaid payments to certain health care providers to be reasonable and adequate in order to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated health care facilities 
states must now use a public notice and comment period in order to determine rates and provide interested parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed rates and the justification for and the methodology used in calculating such rates 
there can be no assurance that budget constraints or other factors will not cause states to reduce medicaid reimbursement to nursing facilities and pharmacies or that payments to nursing facilities and pharmacies will be made on timely basis 
the law also grants greater flexibility to states to establish medicaid managed care projects without the need to obtain a federal waiver 
although these waiver projects generally exempt institutional care  including nursing facilities and institutional pharmacy services  no assurances can be given that these projects ultimately will not change the reimbursement system for long term care  including pharmacy services from fee for service to managed care negotiated or capitated rates 
the company anticipates that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
in july  the clinton administration issued a new initiative to promote the quality of care in nursing homes 
this initiative includes  but is not limited to i increased enforcement of nursing home safety and quality regulations  ii increased federal oversight of state inspections of nursing homes  iii prosecution of egregious violations of regulations governing nursing homes  iv the publication of nursing home survey results on the internet  and v continuation of the development of the minimum data set mds  a national automated clinical data system

anticipated impact of healthcare reform based upon the company s recent experience with eldercare centers which it manages that transitioned to pps effective july  and based upon the company s ongoing budget process for its fiscal year ending september   the company believes that the impact of pps on the company s future earnings is likely to be greater than originally anticipated by management due to various factors  including lower than anticipated medicare per diem revenues  lower than anticipated medicare part b revenues caused by a census shift to medicare patients having a greater length of stay  higher than expected ancillary costs at the centers due to expanded services covered in the medicare part a rates  lower than anticipated routine cost reductions and lower than expected revenues for contract therapy services 
based upon assumptions  the company estimates that the adverse revenue impact of pps in fiscal will be approximately  on the genesis centers and approximately  on the multicare centers 
in each of fiscal  the company estimates the adverse revenue impact of pps on its genesis centers will approximate an additional  the company estimates that the adverse revenue impact of pps on the multicare eldercare centers will be approximately an additional  in fiscal and an additional  in each of fiscal and the genesis eldercare centers began implementation of pps on october  and the majority of the multicare eldercare centers will begin implementation of pps on january  the actual impact of pps on the company s earnings in fiscal will depend on many variables which can not be quantified at this time  including regulatory changes  patient acuity  patient length of stay  medicare census  referral patterns  ability to reduce costs and growth of ancillary business
