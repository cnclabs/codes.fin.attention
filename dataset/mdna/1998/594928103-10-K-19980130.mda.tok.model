supplier incentives recognized by the company in fiscal have increased significantly from levels 
the company believes that this increase is a result of suppliers attempting to be more price competitive without lowering suggested prices 
for the most part  these incentives are based on sales volume 
a large portion of the incentives are passed on to the company s customers 
however  a portion of the incentives have positively impacted the company s income 
there can be no assurance that supplier incentive funds will continue at levels experienced in fiscal a substantial reduction in the supplier funds available to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
future gross profit percentages may be affected by market pressures  the introduction of new company initiatives  changes in revenue mix  future acquisitions  changes in supplier incentive funds  the company s utilization of early payment discount opportunities  supplier pricing actions  and other competitive and economic pressures

other expenses net 
other expenses net increased to million for the fiscal year ended november  from million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in average daily borrowings to support higher inventory and accounts receivable levels and to take advantage of early payment discount opportunities

ups strike impact on earnings per share 
on august   teamsters union members went on strike against united parcel service ups

days cost of sales in ending inventory decreased from days at october  to days at november  potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on certain factors  including  but not limited to  demand for the company s information technology products and services  the amount of supplier incentive funds received by the company  the results of acquired businesses  product availability  competitive conditions  new product introductions  changes in customer order patterns and general economic conditions

see products and suppliers and competition in part i  item for additional information regarding certain of these factors 
although the company attempts to control its expense levels  these levels are based  in part  on anticipated revenues 
therefore  the company may not be able to control spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  quarterly period to period comparisons of the company s financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  although the company s financial performance has not exhibited significant seasonality in the past  the company and the computer industry in general tend to follow a sales pattern with peaks occurring near the end of the calendar year  due primarily to special vendor promotions and year end business purchases 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth and cash needs to date primarily through working capital financing facilities  bank credit lines  common stock offerings and cash generated from operations 
the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales 
if the company is successful in achieving continued revenue growth see business strategy in part i  item  its working capital requirements will continue to increase

the company s future acquisitions or investments may be made utilizing cash  stock or a combination of cash and stock 
cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a change in cash used by inventory and accounts payable 
during fiscal  million was used in operating activities for inventory and accounts payable compared to million provided by inventory and accounts payable during the cash provided in was the result of a decrease in days cost of sales in ending inventory from days at the end of to days at the end of  while accounts payable days increased from days to days for the same period 
days cost of sales in ending inventory increased from days at november  to days at november   while days cost of sales in ending accounts payable increased from days to days for the same period 
the change in cash provided by inventory and accounts payable was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by accounts receivable from million for to million for the change in cash used by accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in receivables sold under a financing facility see discussion below from million at november  to million at november  days sales in ending receivables adjusted for the sold receivables were days at november  compared to days at november  cash used in investing activities increased from million in to million in due to an million increase in purchases of property and equipment as a result of increased spending for electronic commerce initiatives and capacity expansion in systems and facilities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used in of million 
the change was primarily due to increased borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the company maintains three financing agreements the agreements with financing facilities totaling million 
the agreements include an accounts receivable facility the a r facility and inventory financing facilities the inventory facilities 
under the a r facility  the company has the right to sell certain accounts receivable from time to time  on a limited recourse basis  up to an aggregate amount of million sold at any given time 
at november   the net amount of sold accounts receivable was million 
the inventory facilities provide for borrowings up to million 
within the inventory facilities  the company has lines of credit for the purchase of inventory from selected product suppliers inventory lines of credit of million and a line of credit for general working capital requirements supplemental line of credit of million 
payments for products purchased under the inventory lines of credit vary depending upon the product supplier  but generally are due between and days from the date of the advance 
amounts borrowed under the supplemental line of credit may remain outstanding until the expiration date of the agreements august 
no interest or finance charges are payable on the inventory lines of credit if payments are made when due 
at november   the company had million outstanding under the inventory lines of credit included in accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets  and million outstanding under the supplemental line of credit 
of the million of financing capacity represented by the agreements  million was unused as of november  utilization of the unused portion is dependent upon the company s collateral availability at the time the funds would be needed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to borrow adequate amounts on terms acceptable to the company 
borrowings under the agreements are secured by substantially all of the company s assets  and the agreements contain certain restrictive covenants  including working capital and tangible net worth requirements  and ratios of debt to tangible net worth and current assets to current liabilities 
at november   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
in addition to the financing facilities discussed above  the company maintains an accounts receivable purchase agreement the purchase agreement with a commercial credit corporation the buyer whereby the buyer agrees to purchase  from time to time at its option  on a limited recourse basis  certain accounts receivable of the company 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  no finance charges are assessed if the accounts are settled within forty days 
at november   the net amount of sold accounts receivable under the purchase agreement was million 
the company also maintains trade credit arrangements with its suppliers and other creditors to finance product purchases 
a few major suppliers maintain security interests in their products sold to the company 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the agreements or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on the company 
although the company has no material capital commitments  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately to million in the next fiscal year 
inflation the company believes that inflation has generally not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date
