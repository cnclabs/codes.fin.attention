the company commenced operations in january and has operated as a self administered reit 
the company succeeded to the real estate business of the kilroy group  the company s predecessor  which had been engaged in the acquisition  management  financing  construction and leasing of commercial and industrial properties 
the combined financial statements of the kilroy group comprise the operations  assets and liabilities of the properties contributed to the company in connection with the formation transactions following the ipo on january  see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a discussion of the organization and formation of the company 
as of december   the company owned office buildings and industrial buildings  which encompassed approximately million and million rentable square feet  respectively  and were leased

income is derived primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements 
as a result of the company s acquisitions in  the financial data shows significant increases in total revenues and expenses for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and for the foregoing reason  management does not believe the financial data for the year ended december  is comparable to the year ended december  the company anticipates that the most significant part of its revenue growth in the next one to two years will come from additional acquisitions 
however  if the southern california office and industrial rental market continues to improve  then rental rate increases may become a more substantial part of its revenue growth 
results of operations the company s management believes that in order to provide meaningful historical analysis of the financial statements  certain adjustments must be made to the historical kilroy group financial statements to make accounting periods comparable 
accordingly  the results of operations for the period january  to january  have been adjusted to reflect interest income  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and extraordinary gains as if the ipo had been consummated on january  the following section discusses the results of operations as adjusted 
adjusted year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  unaudited  as adjusted in thousands revenues rental income   tenant reimbursements   interest income  development services other income total revenues   expenses property expenses   real estate taxes   general and administrative   ground leases  development expense option buy out cost  interest expense   depreciation and amortization   total expenses   adjusted income loss before equity in income of subsidiary  minority interest and extraordinary gains 
  total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in rental income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase was due primarily to the purchase of office and industrial buildings encompassing an aggregate of million rentable square feet subsequent to the ipo 
the following two paragraphs discuss the changes in rental income resulting from the portfolio of properties which existed at the ipo  and the subsequent acquisitions 
rental income from office buildings increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in this improvement was due to an increase of  square feet of office space under lease  from  square feet at december  to  square feet at december  excluding the lease with the boeing company for  rentable square feet  which provides for occupancy on december  
approximately  rentable square feet of the increase reflects four office buildings acquired in connection with the ipo and  rentable square feet represents office buildings purchased subsequent to the ipo 
the remaining increase in office space under lease is primarily the result of leasing activity at kilroy airport center in el segundo and kilroy airport center long beach 
however  the increase in square footage under lease was offset by a decrease in average rent per rentable square foot at kilroy airport center in el segundo  from per square foot for the year ended december  to for the same period in  as a result of the re negotiation and extension of a lease with hughes space and communications in november average rent per rentable square foot also decreased at kilroy airport center long beach  from per rentable square foot for the year ended december  to for the same period in due to the re leasing of  square feet and the lease up of  square feet to mcdonnell douglas corporation at a rate substantially lower than under the previous leases

funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations  as defined by nareit  an alternative measure of performance for an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit to mean net income loss before minority interest of unitholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustment  for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the combined historical operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper  which may differ from the methodologies used by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to that published by such other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or the ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents the company s funds from operations for the three quarters ended december   september  and june  and the period from february  to march  three months ended february  to december  september  june  march  in thousands net income     add minority interest  depreciation and amortization     depreciation and amortization on unconsolidated subsidiary
