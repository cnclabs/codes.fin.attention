the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or fail 
the company is in the process of working with its software vendors to ensure that the software that the company has licensed from third parties will operate properly in the year and beyond 
in addition  the company is working with its external suppliers and service providers to ensure that they and their systems will be able to support the company s needs and  where necessary  interoperate with the company s server and networking hardware and software infrastructure in preparation for the year management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer systems improvements to be year compliant 
however  significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with any year compliance 
any year compliance problems of either the company  its customers or vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
