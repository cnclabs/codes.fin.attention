item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management strategy the company is pursuing a strategy that is designed to improve its performance by positioning the bank as a locally managed full service community bank in an increasingly competitive environment 
mortgage lending is expected to continue as an important part of the company s business including specialized mortgage programs for self employed individuals and for small multi family building owners 
another key component of the company s strategy is the provision of nonbanking financial services and products  such as annuity and insurance products and brokerage services through invest to retain and attract customers 
the nonbanking financial services and products are also intended to generate additional fee income and thereby improve profitability 
the company also intends to diversify its asset base and at the same time develop further customer relationships through increased consumer lending activities  such as home equity lending 
finally  the company will continue to pursue opportunities for growth and expansion in the bank s existing marketplace  whether through acquisitions or through additional facilities 
the company may seek additional asset growth to further leverage its net worth 
in the event that its traditional retail sources of funding and investment opportunities ie  deposits and direct lending are insufficient for this purpose  or appear to be inappropriately priced  the bank may further utilize the wholesale markets  such as fhlb advances for funding  and governmental and agency securities for investments 
year readiness disclosure the company s state of readiness on sunday  october  the company conducted a full scale test of its transaction processing systems utilizing the date of january  an extensive set of transactions was tested using production teller terminals and related computer hardware  software  and data communications systems 
there were no significant failures or problems during the testing 
a few minor issues arose and will be addressed with fiserv  the company s data processing service provider  prior to the next test which is scheduled for february  concerning non information technology systems embedded microcontrollers  etc 
the company has tested such things as vault doors  alarm systems  etc 
and is not aware of any significant problems with such systems 
there are three third parties with whom the company has a material relationship  and thus potential exposure to year issues 
the fiserv systems  as mentioned above  are already being tested 
the company s main commercial banking relationship is with harris bank in chicago 
harris newsletters indicate substantial progress with year readiness 
the company also has a material relationship with the federal home loan bank of chicago  whose newsletters also indicate substantial progress with year readiness 
the three third utilities on which the company is dependent are ameritech phone service  commonwealth edison electricity and people s gas natural gas for heating 
the company has not identified any practical  long term alternatives to relying on these companies for basic utility services 
the costs to address the company s year issues the incremental direct costs to address the company s year issues are not expected to exceed  exclusive of any costs incurred because of the failure of one or more of the utility companies mentioned above 
at the present time  no situations that will require material cost expenditures to become fully compliant have been identified 
however  the year problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any computer process 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future financial results 
it is not possible at this time to quantify the estimated future costs due to possible business disruption caused by vendors  suppliers  customers  or even the possible loss of electric power or phone service  however  such costs could be substantial 
the risks of the company s year issues the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario involves a complete failure of the utility companies mentioned above for all five of our operating locations simultaneously 
this scenario would severely curtail the company s ability to conduct its business  including its ability to generate new loans and to develop new deposit account relationships 
the effect on existing loans and deposits is not predictable or quantifiable 
the company s contingency plans in the event of a complete utility failure  the company plans to operate at least two locations on a restricted schedule during daylight hours 
a manual bookkeeping system will be employed  and battery powered satellite phones or other alternative communications systems will be used for communication between operating locations

the following table sets forth information regarding non accrual loans  loans which are days or more past due  and real estate in foreclosure 
the bank continues accruing interest on all consumer loans until a loss determination is made 
upon determination that the loan will result in a loss  the bank discontinues the accrual of interest and or establishes a reserve in the amount of the anticipated loss 
for the year ended september   interest income on non accrual loans included in net income amounted to less than  if all non accrual mortgage loans  as of september   had been currently performing in accordance with their original terms  the bank would have recognized interest income from such loans of  at september  dollars in thousands non accrual mortgage loans   non accrual commercial leases  non accrual consumer loans total non accrual loans   consumer loans days or more past due and still accruing total non performing loans   real estate in foreclosure total non performing assets   total non performing loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets classified assets 
federal regulations require the bank to classify loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities  considered by the ots to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
the bank s classification policies provide that assets will be classified according to ots regulations 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management 
when the bank determines that an asset should be classified  it generally does not establish a specific allowance for such asset unless it determines that such asset may result in a loss 
the bank may  however  increase its general valuation allowance in an amount deemed prudent 
general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
the bank s policies provide for the establishment of a specific allowance equal to of each asset classified as loss or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews the problem loans in its portfolio on a monthly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations  and believes its classification policies are consistent with ots policies 
as of september   the bank had classified assets of  classified loans of  were categorized as substandard  consisting of residential mortgage loans  multi family loan  and unsecured line of credit 
in addition to the mortgage and consumer portfolio  the bank classified its investment in commercial leases as substandard 
there were no assets classified as doubtful 
from october through january  the bank purchased full payout commercial equipment leases located in various parts of the country with original aggregate outstanding principal balances of million 
since that time normal lease payments had reduced the aggregate outstanding balance to million at february  these leases were all originated by  serviced by  and financially guaranteed by bennett funding group of syracuse  new york bfg 
on march  it was reported that bfg was the target of a civil complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission 
on that same date bfg filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the northern district of new york and halted payments on the lease agreements 
the bankruptcy trustee is currently collecting the lease payments from the lessees and holding them in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation concerning bfg  its creditors  and related issues 
this disruption of payment flows from the servicer  bfg  has caused the company to classify all the leases as substandard  place them on non accrual status and to categorize them as non performing and impaired 
in august  the bank and the bennett bankruptcy trustee reached a settlement agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  the bank received post bankruptcy lease receipts totaling million 
repayment of the balance of  in lease receivables at september  is expected from future lease payments 
the settlement also ended all outstanding litigation 
as a result of the settlement  the company charged off  of leases in  against the previously established allowance 
during fiscal  the company received and additional  in payments 
at september  the recorded book value of the bennett lease was  allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
in recent years  in light of the general economic conditions  management has  from time to time  increased its provision to account for its evaluation of the potential effects of such conditions 
the bank will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as conditions dictate 
although the bank maintains its allowance at a level which it considers adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
the following table sets forth the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated

for internal purposes  the bank does not allocate the allowance among loan classifications 
in the following table  the allowance for loan losses has been allocated by category for purposes of complying with public disclosure requirements 
the amount allocated on the following table to any category should not be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs and the amounts allocated are not intended to reflect the amount that may be available for future losses on any category since the bank s allowance is a general allowance

the company is the holder of certain subordinated notes the notes issued by cole taylor financial group  inc the notes have a par value and cost basis of million 
the notes were acquired by the company in  when cole taylor financial group  inc was the parent company for both a consumer finance company and a chicago area bank 
in fiscal  cole taylor s bank subsidiary was spun off to certain cole taylor shareholders in exchange for stock and certain assets 
the notes remained as obligations of the surviving company  which is now known as reliance acceptance group  inc racc and is the parent company for the consumer finance company 
on november   racc filed a form q with the sec in which racc reported  among other things  substantial additions to its loan loss reserves  increasing delinquencies and repossession losses  a severe decline in its net interest margin  continuing defaults under senior credit agreements  a lack of future funding sources  and the imposition of substantial restrictions by senior lenders 
in april racc filed a plan of reorganization with the united states bankruptcy court in delaware 
the company has evaluated currently available information about racc s present circumstances and future prospects in an effort to assess impairment and to place a value on the notes in the context of a possible racc liquidation  sale and or bankruptcy 
the company concluded that the impairment is other than temporary  and that a complete write down of the notes was appropriate  because of racc s worsening condition  the fact that the notes are subordinate to the senior debt and are structurally subordinate to the other obligations of racc s finance company subsidiary  and the substantial uncertainties that exist regarding ultimate realization of the asset 
accordingly  the company wrote the notes down million during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended september  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the write down was charged against fiscal year earnings because the notes were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
the company intends to closely monitor future developments concerning racc  and to continue to explore alternatives for realizing a recovery on this investment

supervision and regulation general financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law 
as a result  the growth and earnings performance of the company can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes and regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities including  but not limited to  the ots  the fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb  the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities and the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the effect of such statutes  regulations and policies can be significant  and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty 
federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions  such as the company and the bank  regulate  among other things  the scope of business  investments  reserves against deposits  capital levels relative to operations  the nature and amount of collateral for loans  the establishment of branches  mergers  consolidations and dividends 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to the company and the bank establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance funds and the depositors  rather than the shareholders  of financial institutions 
the following references to material statutes and regulations affecting the company and the bank are brief summaries thereof and do not purport to be complete  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
any change in applicable law or regulations may have a material effect on the business of the company and the bank 
recent regulatory developments year compliance guidelines 
the federal banking regulators recently issued guidelines establishing minimum safety and soundness standards for achieving year compliance 
the guidelines  which took effect october  and apply to all fdic insured depository institutions  establish standards for developing and managing year project plans  testing remediation efforts and planning for contingencies 
the guidelines are based upon guidance previously issued by the agencies under the auspices of the federal financial institutions examination council the ffiec  but are not intended to replace or supplant the ffiec guidance which will continue to apply to all federally insured depository institutions 
the guidelines were issued under section of the federal deposit insurance act  as amended the fdia  which requires the federal banking regulators to establish standards for the safe and sound operation of federally insured depository institutions 
under section of the fdia  if an institution fails to meet any of the standards established in the guidelines  the institution s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving compliance 
if an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan  or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator  the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency 
such an order is enforceable in court in the same manner as a cease and desist order 
until the deficiency cited in the regulator s order is cured  the regulator may restrict the institution s rate of growth  require the institution to increase its capital  restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances 
in addition to the enforcement procedures established in section of the fdia  noncompliance with the standards established by the guidelines may also be grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators  including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments 
the company general 
the company  as the sole shareholder of the bank  is a savings and loan holding company 
as a savings and loan holding company  the company is registered with  and is subject to regulation by  the ots under the home owners loan act  as amended the hola 
under the hola  the company is subject to periodic examination by the ots and is required to file with the ots periodic reports of its operations and such additional information as the ots may require 
investments and activities 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from i acquiring control of  or acquiring by merger or purchase of assets  another savings association or savings and loan holding company without the prior written approval of the ots  ii subject to certain exceptions  acquiring more than of the issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company except as part of an acquisition of control approved by the ots  or iii acquiring or retaining control of a financial institution that does not have fdic insurance of accounts 
a savings and loan holding company may acquire savings associations located in more than one state in both supervisory transactions involving failing savings associations and nonsupervisory acquisitions of healthy institutions  subject to the requirement that in any nonsupervisory transaction  the law of the state in which the savings association to be acquired is located must specifically authorize the proposed acquisition  by language to that effect and not merely by implication 
state laws vary in the extent to which interstate acquisitions of savings associations and savings and loan holding companies are permitted 
illinois law presently permits savings and loan holding companies located in any state of the united states to acquire savings associations or savings and loan holding companies located in illinois  subject to certain conditions  including the requirement that the laws of the state in which the acquiror is located permit savings and loan holding companies located in illinois to acquire savings associations or savings and loan holding companies in the acquiror s state 
a savings and loan holding company that  like the company  controls only one savings association subsidiary is generally not subject to any restrictions on the non banking activities that the holding company may conduct either directly or through a non banking subsidiary  so long as the holding company s savings association subsidiary constitutes a qualified thrift lender see the bank qualified thrift lender test 
if  however  the ots determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of a particular activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of its savings association subsidiary  the ots may require the holding company to cease engaging in the activity or divest any subsidiary which engages in the activity or may impose such restrictions on the holding company and the subsidiary savings association as the ots deems necessary to address the risk  including imposing limitations on i the payment of dividends by the savings association to the holding company  ii transactions between the savings association and its affiliates and iii any activities of the savings association that might create a serious risk that liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings association 
federal law also prohibits acquisition of control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of of the outstanding shares of a savings association or savings and loan holding company 
dividends 
the delaware general corporation law the dgcl allows the company to pay dividends only out of its surplus as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the dgcl  or if the company has no such surplus  out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
additionally  the ots possesses enforcement powers over savings and loan holding companies to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by savings and loan holding companies 
federal securities regulation 
the company s common stock is registered with the sec under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
consequently  the company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the sec under the exchange act 
the bank general 
the bank is a federally chartered savings association  the deposits of which are insured by the saif of the fdic 
as a saif insured  federally chartered savings association  the bank is subject to the examination  supervision  reporting and enforcement requirements of the ots  as the chartering authority for federal savings associations  and the fdic as administrator of the saif 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank system  which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
deposit insurance 
as an fdic insured institution  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluations 
institutions classified as well capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium 
risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the fdic for each semi annual assessment period 
during calendar year  saif assessments ranged from of deposits to of deposits 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the fdic determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order  or any condition imposed in writing by  or written agreement with  the fdic 
the fdic may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
management of the company is not aware of any activity or condition that could result in termination of the deposit insurance of the bank 
fico assessments 
since  a portion of the deposit insurance assessments paid by saif members has been used to cover interest payments due on the outstanding obligations of the fico  the entity created to finance the recapitalization of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation  the saif s predecessor insurance fund 
pursuant to federal legislation enacted september   commencing january   both saif members and bank insurance fund bif members became subject to assessments to cover the interest payments on outstanding fico obligations 
such fico assessments are in addition to amounts assessed by the fdic for deposit insurance 
until january   the fico assessments made against bif members may not exceed of the amount of the fico assessments made against saif members 
between january  and the maturity of the outstanding fico obligations in  bif members and saif members will share the cost of the interest on the fico bonds on a pro rata basis 
during the period october  to september   the fico assessment rate for saif members ranged from of deposits to of deposits while the fico assessment rate for bif members ranged from of deposits to of deposits 
during the year ended september   the bank paid fico assessments totaling  ots assessments 
all federal savings associations are required to pay supervisory fees to the ots to fund the operations of the ots 
the amount of such supervisory fees is based upon each institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported to the ots 
during the year ended september   the bank paid supervisory fees to the ots totaling capital requirements 
pursuant to the hola and ots regulations  savings associations  such as the bank  are subject to the following minimum capital requirements a core capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of core capital to total assets of  a tangible capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of tangible capital to total assets of  and a risk based capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must consist of core capital 
for purposes of these capital standards  core capital consists primarily of permanent stockholders equity less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill  certain mortgage servicing rights and certain purchased credit card relationships and less investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permitted for national banks  tangible capital is substantially the same as core capital except that all intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing rights must be deducted  and total capital consists primarily of core capital plus certain debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as core capital  and a portion of the bank s allowances for loan and leases losses 
the capital requirements described above are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions 
for example  the regulations of the ots provide that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk or the risks posed by concentrations of credit or nontraditional activities 
during the year ended september   the bank was not required by the ots to increase its capital to an amount in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement 
as of september  the bank exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements with a core capital ratio of  a tangible capital ratio of and a risk based capital ratio of 
the ots has proposed to amend its regulations to establish a minimum core capital requirement of of total assets for any savings association assigned a composite rating of under the uniform financial institutions rating system ufirs as of the association s most recent ots examination  with a minimum core capital requirement of of total assets for all other savings associations 
it is not anticipated that the adoption of this proposal would affect the bank s ability to comply with the ots capital requirements 
federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
the extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned  the regulators corrective powers include requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan  placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities  requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock including additional voting stock or to be acquired  restricting transactions with affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  ordering a new election of directors of the institution  requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries  prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt  and ultimately  appointing a receiver for the institution 
dividends 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations  including cash dividends 
the rule establishes three tiers of institutions 
an institution that exceeds all fully phased in capital requirements before and after the proposed capital distribution a tier institution could  after prior notice to  but without the approval of  the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year in an aggregate amount of up to the higher of i of its net income to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio ie  the excess capital over its fully phased in capital requirements at the beginning of the calendar year  or ii of its net income over the most recent preceding four quarter period 
any additional capital distributions would require prior ots approval 
as of september   the bank was a tier institution 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations  and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if  following payment thereof  the institution would be undercapitalized 
as described above  the bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of september  further  under applicable regulations of the ots  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount which would reduce its capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with the bank s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership in notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends  however  the ots may prohibit the payment of any dividends by the bank if the ots determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
the ots has proposed to amend its regulations governing capital distributions including cash dividends by savings associations 
the proposed amendment would require prior ots approval for any capital distribution by a savings association that is not eligible for expedited processing under the ots s application processing regulations 
in order to qualify for expedited processing  a savings association must i have a composite ufirs rating of or  ii have a community reinvestment act rating of satisfactory or better  iii have a compliance rating of or  iv meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements  and v not have been notified by the ots that it is a problem association or an association in troubled condition 
savings associations that qualify for expedited processing would be required to obtain ots approval prior to making a capital distribution only if the amount of the proposed capital distribution  when aggregated with all other capital distributions during the same calendar year  would exceed an amount equal to the association s year to date net income plus its retained net income for the preceding two years 
the proposed amendment will continue to require that the ots be given prior notice of certain types of capital distributions  including any capital distribution by a savings association that  like the bank  is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company 
insider transactions 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to the company and its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company and its subsidiaries and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the company or its subsidiaries as collateral for loans 
certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the bank to its directors and officers  to directors and officers of the company and its subsidiaries  to principal stockholders of the company  and to related interests of such directors  officers and principal stockholders 
in addition  federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of the company or one of its subsidiaries or a principal stockholder of the company may obtain credit from banks with which the bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
safety and soundness standards 
the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines which establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions 
the guidelines set forth standards for internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  asset quality  earnings and year compliance 
in general  the guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area  and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals 
if an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines  the institution s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance 
the preamble to the guidelines states that the agencies expect to require a compliance plan from an institution whose failure to meet one or more of the guidelines is of such severity that it could threaten the safety and soundness of the institution 
failure to submit an acceptable plan  or failure to comply with a plan that has been accepted by the appropriate federal regulator  would constitute grounds for further enforcement action 
branching authority 
federally chartered savings associations which qualify as domestic building and loan associations  as defined in the internal revenue code  or meet the qualified thrift lender test see the bank qualified thrift lender test have the authority  subject to receipt of ots approval  to establish branch offices anywhere in the united states  either de novo or through acquisitions of all or part of another financial institution 
if a federal savings association fails to qualify as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code  and fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test  the association may branch only to the extent permitted for national banks located in the savings association s home state 
as of september   the bank qualified as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code and met the qtl test 
qualified thrift lender test 
the hola requires every savings association to satisfy a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under the hola  a savings association will be deemed to meet the qtl test if it either i maintains at least of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in nine out of every months or ii qualifies as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code 
for purposes of the qtl test  qualified thrift investments include mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  education loans  small business loans  credit card loans and certain other housing and consumer related loans and investments 
portfolio assets consist of a savings association s total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets  the association s business properties and a limited amount of the liquid assets maintained by the association pursuant to the liquidity requirements of the hola and ots regulations see the bank liquidity requirements 
a savings association that fails to meet the qtl test must either convert to a bank charter or operate under certain restrictions on its activities and  within one year following the loss of qtl status  the holding company for the savings association will be required to register as  and will be deemed to be  a bank holding company 
a savings association that fails the qtl test may requalify as a qtl but it may do so only once 
as of september   the bank satisfied the qtl test  with a ratio of qualified thrift investments to portfolio assets of  and qualified as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code 
liquidity requirements 
ots regulations currently require each savings association to maintain  for each calendar quarter  an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances  and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations equal to at least of either i its liquidity base ie  its net withdrawable accounts plus borrowings repayable in months or less as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter or ii the average daily balance of its liquidity base during the preceding calendar quarter 
this liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to an amount within a range of to of the liquidity base  depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of savings associations 
the ots may also require a savings association to maintain a higher level of liquidity than the minimum requirement if the ots deems necessary to ensure the safe and sound operation of the association 
penalties may be imposed for failure to meet liquidity ratio requirements 
at september   the bank was in compliance with ots liquidity requirements  with a liquidity ratio of 
federal reserve system 
frb regulations  as presently in effect  require depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts  as follows for transaction accounts aggregating million or less  the reserve requirement is of total transaction accounts  and for transaction accounts aggregating in excess of million  the reserve requirement is million plus of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
these reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the frb 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
the balances used to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the frb may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the ots requires all regulated thrift institutions to calculate the estimated change in the bank s net portfolio value npv assuming instantaneous  parallel shifts in the treasury yield curve of to basis point either up or down in basis point increments 
the npv is defined as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the ots provides all institutions that file a schedule entitled the consolidated maturity rate schedule cmr as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the ots simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the ots model estimates the economics value of each type of asset  liability  and off balance sheet contact under the assumption that the treasury yield curve shifts instantaneous and parallel up and down to basis points in basis point increments 
the ots provides thrifts the results of their interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information provided by the bank  to estimate the sensitivity of npv 
the ots model utilizes an option based pricing approach to estimate the sensitivity of mortgage loans 
the most significant embedded option in these types of assets is the prepayment option of the borrowers 
the ots model uses various price indications and prepayment assumptions to estimate sensitivity of mortgage loans 
in the ots model the value of deposit accounts appears on the asset and liability side of the npv analysis 
in estimating the value of certificates of deposit account  the liability portion of the cd is represented by the implied value when comparing the difference between the cd face rate and available wholesale cd rates 
on the asset side of the npv calculation  the value of the customer relationship due to the rollover of retail cd deposits represents an intangible asset in the npv calculation 
other deposit accounts such as transaction accounts  money market deposit accounts  passbook accounts  and non interest bearing accounts also are included on the asset and liability side of the npv calculation in the ots model 
the accounts are valued at of the respective account balances on the liability side 
on the assets side of the analysis  the value of the customer relationship of the various types of deposit accounts is reflected as a deposit intangible 
the npv sensitivity of borrowed funds is estimated by the ots model based on a discounted cash flow approach 
the cash flows are assumed to consist of monthly interest payments with principal paid at maturity 
the ots model is based only on the bank s level balance sheet 
the assets and liabilities at the parent company level are short term in nature  primarily cash and equivalents  and were not considered in the analysis because they would not have a material effect on the analysis of npv sensitivity
