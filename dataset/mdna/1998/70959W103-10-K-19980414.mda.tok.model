the provision for income taxes is million  compared to an income tax credit of million recorded in the credit for was taken as the company determined in the fourth quarter that it was more likely than not that future taxable income from operations would be sufficient to fully realize the tax benefits of net operating losses incurred in prior years 
extraordinary item  net of income tax benefits 
the extraordinary item  net of income tax benefits  of million represents a loss on the retirement of long term debt resulting from a prepayment premium and a write off of associated debt issuance costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and liquidity requirements the cash requirements of the company are primarily for acquisition of new dealerships  working capital and the expansion of existing facilities 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through issuances of equity and debt instruments and cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
during  dealership activities resulted in net cash provided by operations of million 
net cash used by dealerships in investing activities during the year ended december  totaled million  relating primarily to dealership acquisitions  funding provided to unitedauto finance and capital expenditures 
dealership financing activities provided million of cash during the year ended december  principally relating to net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
the company finances substantially all of its new and used vehicle inventory under revolving floor plan financing arrangements with various lenders 
the floor plan lenders pay the manufacturer directly with respect to new vehicles 
the company makes monthly interest payments on the amount financed  but is not required to make loan principal repayments prior to the sale of new and used vehicles 
substantially all of the assets of the company s dealerships are subject to security interests granted to their floor plan lending sources 
at december   the company had approximately million of cash available to fund operations and future acquisitions 
in addition  the company was party to a million senior credit facility  dated march  as amended the senior credit facility  with a group of banks  which was to be used principally for acquisitions 
on february   the company replaced the senior credit facility with a new credit agreement  which provides for up to million in term loans  revolving loans and letters of credit  to be used principally for acquisitions 
during  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes amounted to million  of which million was used to repay in full amounts then outstanding under the senior credit facility 
the balance of the proceeds was deposited with the company s floor plan lenders  which deposits earn interest at rates designated in the company s floor plan agreements with the various floor plan lenders  and ultimately was used for working capital and to fund acquisitions 
the company s principal source of growth has come  and is expected to continue to come  from acquisitions of automobile dealerships 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its current acquisition commitments 
during january and february  the company completed the acquisition of several dealerships and dealer groups 
approximately million of the aggregate consideration in connection therewith was paid in cash  million of which was borrowed under the new credit agreement 
to the extent the company pursues additional significant acquisitions  it may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
a public equity offering would require the prior approval of certain automobile manufacturers 
cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
the company believes that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality the company s combined business is modestly seasonal overall 
the greatest seasonalities exist with the dealerships in the new york metropolitan area  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
the service and parts business at all dealerships experiences relatively modest seasonal fluctuations 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenue or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of its products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
the company finances substantially all of its inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
the company does not believe that it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automobile dealers have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements 
impact of year many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and  if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or generate erroneous results in the year based on a recent assessment  management of the company believes that its computer systems will not require any significant modifications in order to properly process date related information in the year and thereafter or be year compliant 
however  the company could be materially adversely affected if the systems of its significant vendors  including those supplying and maintaining the general ledger and related accounting systems at each of the company s dealerships  will not be year compliant 
the company has received assurances that such vendors are adequately addressing this issue 
nevertheless  there can be no guarantee that the systems provided by such vendors  or that the systems of other companies with which the company does business  will be year compliant and that any such non compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company
