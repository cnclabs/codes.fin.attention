except for cash requirements to fund potential additional acquisitions the company believes that its cash flow provided by operating activities and unused borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  debt service requirements and other working capital needs during seasonality the company s business has been subject to slight seasonal variations which the company has attributed to fluctuations in industrial activity and with annual weather patterns 
historically  net sales from october through december have been somewhat lower than other periods due to anticipated lower demand in the more inclement winter months and planned inventory reductions by major distributors

year compliance many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the upcoming change in century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results at or before the year the company has completed an assessment of substantially all of its computer systems and has identified applications that are not currently year compliant 
during the company initiated a project  separate from initiatives to correct its year issues  to install and implement common software at its survivair  titmus and uvex safety business units 
a license agreement for the software was executed in september and full implementation  including a significant period of pre testing  is expected to be completed during or prior to the first quarter of the company believes that this software is year compliant and that  upon full implementation at survivair and uvex safety  all of the company s material year deficiencies will be corrected 
the license fee and costs to implement the software will be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software 
the cost of modifying or correcting other applications  which do not become year compliant upon implementation of the aforementioned software  is currently estimated to be immaterial and will be expensed as incurred 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete implementation of the common software at survivair and uvex safety by dates critical for year compliance 
failure to complete implementation on a timely basis may have material adverse financial and operational impacts on the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that year deficiencies in the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely  in particular significant vendors  also will be timely corrected or that any such failure to correct deficiencies by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
