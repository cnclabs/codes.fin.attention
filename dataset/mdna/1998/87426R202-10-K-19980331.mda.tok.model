overview in  the company raised approximately million in connection with two private placements of convertible notes 
in addition  as part of its efforts to expand its business into the online market  the company entered into the aol agreement  under which the company provides long distance telecommunications services to be marketed by aol 
the company s results of operations for were negatively impacted by the pre tax charges of million primarily related to the aol agreement  million primarily related to the restructuring of its sales and marketing efforts and million primarily as a result of the company s change in accounting for customer acquisition costs 
these charges were offset by 
million of other income  net of related costs  associated with the break up of a proposed merger between the company and shared technologies fairchild  inc stf 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data as a percentage of sales sales cost of sales gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss investment and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes a net income loss a pro forma tax provisions have been calculated as if the company s results of operations were taxable as a c corporation the company s current tax status for the year ended december  prior to september   the company was an s corporation with all earnings taxed directly to its shareholders 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in sales resulted primarily from the marketing of the company s obn services and the addition of new partitions 
one partition  group long distance inc  accounted for approximately of the company s sales in although the company expects sales to increase by virtue of the aol agreement and  based on its expertise to date  to have attracted approximately  lines to its service by june  as a result of its marketing campaign under the aol agreement in view of the intense competition in this industry  there can be no assurance that the company will increase sales on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis 
cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales increased by to million in from million in as a result of increased sales and charges of million primarily as a result of the company s change in its accounting for customer acquisition costs note  million primarily related to the aol agreement note and million primarily related to the restructuring of its sales and marketing efforts note 
prior to  network usage costs consisted solely of bundled charges from at t 
beginning in  the company also incurred unbundled charges  including local access fees  associated with the operation of obn 
both bundled and unbundled charges are directly related to calls made by the company s end users 
during  the company acquired most of the services purchased from at t for resale or use in obn under at t contract tariff no 
 which was entered into in late and provides rates that are more favorable than under previous tariffs 
the company has the opportunity to terminate this at t tariff without termination liability effective as of april  and currently expects it will do so since it believes that it can replace these services at more favorable rates 
while the company is currently negotiating a new master services contract with at t  which would replace all of the company s existing at t tariffs with what the company expects would be lower rate tariffs  there can be no assurance that such agreement can be reached 
if the company terminates contract tariff no 
and is unsuccessful in reaching a more favorable agreement with at t  it would be required to pay more to obtain these services from at t or negotiate an agreement with another carrier  either another large customer of at t or another facilities based carrier  which may be at rates higher or lower than the company is paying today 
obn and the operation of the company s own switches and network have to date and will in the future require the company to incur systems and equipment maintenance  lease and network personnel expenses significantly above the levels historically experienced by the company as a switchless reseller of at t services 
however  these per call costs  in combination with unbundled charges paid to lecs and at t  were  in  and are expected in the future  to be less than the per call cost currently incurred by the company as a switchless reseller paying bundled charges to at t 
the company made an initial payment of million to aol at the signing of the aol agreement and issued to aol at signing two warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock at a premium over the market value of such stock on the issuance date see note 
of the prepaid aol marketing costs  approximately million was charged to expense in the remaining portion of the prepaid aol marketing costs approximately million at december  will be recognized ratably over the balance of the term of the aol agreement  the initial term of which expires on june   as advertising services are received 
the aol warrant for up to million shares will be valued and charged to expense as and when subscribers to the company s services under the aol agreement sign up and the shares under such warrant vest 
the amount of such charges  which could be significant  will be based on the extent to which such aol warrants vest and the market prices of the company s common stock at the time of vesting and therefore such charges are not currently determinable 
generally  the higher the market price of the company s common stock at the time of vesting  the larger the amount of the charge will be 
the company also anticipates that it may incur up to million in additional aol marketing expenses in for such marketing efforts as direct mail  media campaigns and special pricing and other promotions 
the company has traditionally operated primarily as a wholesale reseller of long distance services 
with the introduction of the aol agreement  the company has begun to focus on a more retail oriented business plan 
as discussed above  the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant upfront expenses for marketing under the aol agreement  the revenues from which may not be realized for some period of time after the expenditures 
in addition  approximately of the orders under the aol agreement have required special attention by the company because of pic freezes imposed by the regional bell operating companies 
see item business regulations 
as the company focuses more on the retail market in  continuing its activities under the aol and compuserve agreements and venturing into other telecommunications services such as dial around and local service  with the increased development and promotional expenses  such as special pricing and other promotion and retention devices  entailed in retail marketing and the greater time period between expenditures and resulting revenues  the company anticipates that its revenues and income could be adversely affected 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the charges discussed above 
absent these charges  gross margin increased to in from in  due to lower network costs for obn services which were lower on a per call basis when compared to those paid to at t 
price competition continues to intensify for the company s products and this trend can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to compensation expenses related to the issuance of options to and the purchase of shares of company common stock by executive officers of the company in connection with the commencement of their employment with the company  the costs associated with hiring additional personnel to support the company s continuing growth  the development costs associated with aol and increased fees for professional services 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as it operates and maintains obn and as it markets the aol service offering 
the additional selling  general and administrative expenses may be offset by the increased sales and gross profit gained as a result of the implementation of the components of the company s strategic plan  but increased costs may have an adverse impact on results of operations and there can be no assurances of such increased sales and profits 
the company granted options to purchase  shares of company common stock at an exercise price of per share to an executive officer and two outside directors 
the options granted are subject to the approval of the stockholders and are being submitted for approval at the company s stockholder meeting scheduled in may of approval of the option grants will result in compensation expense equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market value of the company common stock on the date of such approval

while the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  principally regulates vehicles for pooled investments in securities  such as mutual funds  it also may be deemed to be applicable to companies that are not organized for the purpose of investing or trading in securities but nonetheless have more than a specified percentage of their assets in investment securities 
the company is engaged in the telecommunications business  and the availability of cash and liquid securities is important to the company s ability to take advantage of opportunities to acquire other telecommunications businesses  assets and technologies from time to time 
the company believes  therefore  that its activities do not and will not subject the company to regulation under the investment company act 
however  if the company were to be deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of the investment company act  the company would become subject to certain restrictions relating to the company s activities  including  but not limited to  restrictions on the conduct of its business  the nature of its investments  the issuance of securities and transactions with affiliates 
therefore  the characterization of the company as an investment company would have a material adverse effect on the company

the company generally does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable due to the large number of partitions and end users comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across different geographic regions 
the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses and  to date  such losses have been within the company s expectations 
the company has announced that its board has authorized the repurchase up to eight million shares of its common stock 
it is anticipated that the repurchased shares will be held in treasury for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants and upon conversion  if any  of convertible notes  and for other general corporate purposes 
as noted above in connection with the aol agreement  the company issued two warrants to aol to purchase shares of the company s common stock  including a warrant to purchase million shares at an exercise price of per share 
aol is exercising this warrant as to million shares of company common stock on a net issuance basis and the company is repurchasing from aol all of the  shares issued upon such net issuance exercise for per share 
in connection with such purchases  aol agreed not to dispose of any shares of the company s common stock acquired by aol under any of these warrants until march  the company believes that its current cash position  marketable securities and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year the year issue refers to the potential harm from computer programs that identify dates by the last two digits of the year rather than using the full four digits 
as such  dates after january  could be misidentified  and such programs could fail 
the company has examined its computer based systems and believes that the year problem is not present in such systems 
however  the company is dependent upon computer systems operated by third parties  such as lecs  at t  aol and other vendors 
if those systems were to malfunction due to the year problem  the company s services could fail  as well 
such failures could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is inquiring of such third parties to determine the effect  if any  of the year problem on the systems upon which the company is dependent  and to obtain appropriate assurances that no such problem exists
