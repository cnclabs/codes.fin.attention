item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and gas 
the company s ability to maintain or increase its borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also influenced by oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the control of the company 
these factors include weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of crude oil or natural gas would have an adverse effect on the company s carrying value of its proved reserves  borrowing capacity  revenues  profit ability and cash flows from operations 
subsequent to year end the price of crude oil has declined 
on a mcfe basis  crude oil represents of proved reserves at year end and of the projected production of such reserves 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
year compliance the company does not expect that the cost to modify and replace its information technology infrastructure to be year compliant will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any failure by the company to be in compliance

the company s plans for include capital expenditures of million 
projected cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility are anticipated to be sufficient to fund this capital budget  however  the company may consider alternative sources of financing 
however  future capital expenditure requirements will depend somewhat on exploration results 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to the oil and gas operations of the company for the three year period ended december  december  production oil mbbls gas mmcf    total production mmcfe    average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf total production per mcfe average costs per mcfe lease operating expenses excluding severance taxes severance taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative net of management fees comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenues total oil and gas revenues increased million  or  during to million compared to million in this increase in oil and gas revenues was the result ofincreased gas production volumes and increased average sales prices for both oil and gas 
oil revenues for were million based on production volume of  barrels of oil sold at an average sales price of per barrel 
for  revenues were million based on  barrels of oil sold at an average sales price of 
the million decline in oil revenues is largely attributed to normal production declines from several of the company s oil producing properties  as well as the divestiture of certain non core properties 
gas revenues for were million based on production volumes of bcf of gas sold at an average sales price of per mcf 
for  revenues were million based on bcf of gas sold at an average sales price of 
the increase in production volume is largely attributed to the company s discoveries at chandeleur block and main pass area and the acquisitions in the mobile block area 
lease operating expenses lease operating expenses  including severance taxes  increased from million in to million in separately  severance taxes declined from million in to million in as a result of lower production on properties subject to severance taxes 
other operating expenses increased from million in to million in as a result of the new off shore producing properties 
on a per mcfe basis  these combined expenses decreased from in to in depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for totaled million  or per mcfe 
for the same period in  these expenses totaled million  or per mcfe 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were million  a increase from the million in as a result of expanded levels of operations and production 
on a per mcfe basis  these expenses decreased from in to in interest expense interest expense for was million 
the substantial increase from the 
million in is reflective of the issuance of the senior subordinated notes in november and july income taxes the recorded income tax expense for was million 
this amount represents the approximate statutory income tax rate  as adjusted for expected future utilization of its net operating losses and depletion carryovers 
for  the statutory income tax was million  which was primarily offset by a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenues oil and gas sales increased million  or  during to million compared to million in while oil and gas production volumes for were lower than those reported in  substantial price increases for both oil and gas more than offset the loss in revenues 
the average sales price per barrel sold in increased to  compared to for the average sales price per mcf of gas sold increased from in to in oil production for decreased slightly to  barrels from the  barrels produced in this reduction was primarily attributable to the implementation of the required environmental protection program zero discharge at our black bay complex  the company s largest single oil producing prospect 
during this process  several producing wells were shut in while various new equipment was installed 
in addition  several wells were temporarily shut in while repairs were conducted on the service lines 
therefore  average daily production for dropped to  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day in gas production for was bcf  a decrease from the bcf reported in this reduction was primarily attributable to the loss of production from the north dauphin island field where problems with excess water content in the gas sales stream were encountered early in the year requiring the installation of a dehydrator and removal of water from the lines 
extraneous water production from the a well led to the shut in of the well and the natural decline of the reservoir pressure 
also during the year  this field incurred a lower production rate due to compressor inefficiencies which led to a compressor restaging program that was completed in late september 
lease operating expenses lease operating expenses  including severance taxes  increased from million in to million in a large portion of this increase   is attributable to normal expenses associated with new property additions 
other expenses included the installation of a dehydrator and the workover expenses at the north dauphin island field
