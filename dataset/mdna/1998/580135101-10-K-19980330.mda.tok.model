n m not meaningful restaurants mcdonald s continues to invest in the future through prudent and strategic expansion 
in  the company added  restaurants systemwide  compared with  in and  in in  the company plans to add a similar number of restaurants as were added in  with a continued emphasis on full menu traditional restaurants primarily in international locations 
ten years ago us     europe    asia pacific    latin america  other    systemwide restaurants     the us expansion rate declined in partly due to the previously announced satellite restaurant closings 
additionally  us traditional restaurant expansion slowed due to a more stringent selection process 
asia pacific s percent of total restaurants has grown primarily due to japan s significant expansion 
japan added restaurants in  in and in  representing about of systemwide restaurants opened in and  and in about two thirds of japan s restaurant additions are smaller and have lower average development costs and lower average sales volumes than traditional restaurants 
therefore  these additions affect unit growth more than sales growth 
at the end of  of systemwide restaurants were in the following markets australia  brazil  canada  england  france  germany  hong kong  japan  the netherlands  taiwan and the us major markets 
this compares with for in  of restaurant additions were in these major markets  and we anticipate a similar percent for new and emerging markets like china  the philippines  and the africa middle east and central europe regions are expected to represent a greater percent of restaurant additions 
additionally  rapid expansion is expected to continue in latin america 
ten years ago operated by franchisees     operated by the company     operated by affiliates    systemwide restaurants     franchisees and affiliates operated of restaurants at year end that percentage has remained relatively constant over the past three years 
about of company operated restaurants and of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets in restaurants operated by affiliates were principally located in argentina  japan  malaysia  the philippines and the us most of the satellite restaurants in operation were in japan and the us systemwide sales systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements 
increasing market share and customer satisfaction through expansion  quality  service  cleanliness and value continue to be key strategic initiatives to build sales 
sales increases in and were primarily due to restaurant expansion worldwide  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and  in  negative comparable sales on a constant currency basis 
in  of systemwide sales were in the major markets  compared with in in millions us    europe    asia pacific    latin america    other    systemwide sales    in the us  sales increased primarily due to restaurant expansion 
despite a continuing competitive environment  comparable sales increased in reflecting successful marketing and promotions  including chicken mcnuggets  monopoly and teenie beanie babies  offset in part by disappointing results from campaign comparable sales decreased in reflecting an extremely competitive us operating environment 
in europe  sales increases in were driven by expansion and higher constant currency comparable sales in england  italy  the netherlands and spain 
the acquisition of about burghy restaurants supported italy s impressive sales growth 
in addition  although the economy was weak in france  our constant currency comparable sales increased in these results were partly offset by lower comparable sales in germany where economic conditions were also weak 
in asia pacific  the philippines and taiwan had strong sales increases in  driven by extra value meal marketing campaigns and restaurant expansion  despite difficult economic conditions in the latter part of the year 
brazil contributed one third of latin america s total sales growth in  due to accelerated expansion 
higher constant currency comparable sales and expansion were the primary drivers of significant sales growth in argentina  mexico  puerto rico and venezuela 
sales by company operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than systemwide sales in and  primarily due to the higher unit growth rate of company operated restaurants outside the us relative to systemwide restaurants 
in addition  the weakening japanese yen had a significant negative effect on our japanese affiliate s sales  which dampened systemwide sales growth 
ten years ago in millions operated by franchisees     operated by the company     operated by affiliates     systemwide sales     while us comparable sales were slightly positive in  average annual sales at us restaurants in operation at least consecutive months declined slightly to  average sales are affected by several factors comparable sales  the size of new restaurants and the expansion rate 
expansion affects average sales as new restaurants historically have taken about four years to reach long term volumes 
while international constant currency comparable sales declined only slightly in  average annual sales at restaurants in operation at least consecutive months decreased  to  nearly half of this decline was due to foreign currency translation 
an additional was due to more satellite restaurants which typically have significantly lower sales volumes than traditional restaurants 
finally  average sales have trended lower as we have accelerated expansion and opened more restaurants in lower density areas and countries with lower average sales 
generally  our investment costs are lower for restaurants with lower sales volumes 
total revenues total revenues include sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees include rent  service fees and royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees 
fees vary by type of site and investment by the company  and also according to local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have year terms 
revenues grow as new restaurants are added and as sales build in existing restaurants 
menu price changes also affect revenues and sales  but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures  new products  promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets 
revenues increased at a faster rate than systemwide sales in and this was primarily due to the weakening japanese yen  which negatively affected sales more than revenues due to our affiliate structure in japan  and the higher growth rate in company operated versus franchised restaurants

us revenues increased million in and million in the slower revenue growth in was primarily because the number of us company operated restaurants decreased over the past year  while the number of franchised and affiliated restaurants increased 
lower initial fees resulting from fewer openings also contributed to the slower revenue growth 
in  europe accounted for of consolidated revenues 
this region s revenues grew million in  compared with growth of million in in  the growth was primarily driven by strong sales in england  italy and russia 
asia pacific s revenues grew million and million in and  respectively 
in  the consolidation of singapore  due to increased ownership  along with continued strong results in taiwan  helped to advance revenues 
difficult economic conditions in certain markets during the latter half of dampened this increase 
latin america s revenues grew million in and million in the growth was primarily due to accelerated expansion in brazil and chile s ownership change from an affiliate to a wholly owned subsidiary 
operating results outside the us in millions revenues sales by company operated restaurants      revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants    total revenues      operating costs and expenses company operated restaurants

company operated margins company operated margins equal sales by company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants 
consolidated company operated margins were of sales in  in and in operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows food paper costs increased in and decreased in  payroll costs decreased in and were relatively flat in  and occupancy other operating costs increased in both years 
us company operated margins were of sales in and  and in stable margins as a percent of sales in reflected higher food paper costs related primarily to the deluxe line  lower payroll costs related to enhanced labor efficiencies and lower occupancy other operating costs 
the decline in the margin as a percent of sales in was driven by higher payroll costs  primarily due to increases in average hourly rates  and higher occupancy other operating costs  partly offset by lower food paper costs 
outside the us  company operated margins were of sales in  compared with in and in in  increases in food paper costs as well as occupancy other operating costs as a percent of sales offset a decrease in payroll costs 
the decline in the margin as a percent of sales was due to an increase in occupancy other operating costs  while food paper costs and payroll costs were flat 
franchised margins franchised margin dollars equal revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with these sites 
franchised margin dollars represented about two thirds of the combined operating margin in both and consolidated franchised margins were of applicable revenues in  in and in franchised margins in the us were of revenues in  in and in outside the us  franchised margins were of revenues in  in and in franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues declined in and in  primarily due to a higher proportion of leased sites 
for leased sites  financing costs implicit in the lease are included in rent expense  which affects these margins  for owned sites  financing costs are reflected in interest expense  which does not affect these margins 
the decline in the us franchised margin also reflected lower initial fees resulting from fewer openings  and rent adjustments 
franchised margins include revenues from restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements  net of the company s expenses for these sites 
under these arrangements  the company leases the businesses  including equipment  to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses 
higher fees are charged  but margin percentages are generally lower because of equipment depreciation 
the company is compensated for lower margins by the subsequent gains realized from the exercise of purchase options  accounted for as other operating income 
there were restaurants operating under such arrangements at year end  compared with in and in selling  general and administrative expenses increases in selling  general and administrative expenses in and were primarily due to strategic global spending to support value initiatives  execution strategies and restaurant development  offset in part by weaker foreign currencies 
the spending included continued investment in developing countries and support of special marketing efforts and new food initiatives in the us while expenses have been relatively constant as a percent of systemwide sales at in and  and in  our goal is to reduce expenses as a percent of sales 
other operating income expense net other operating income expense net includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net gains or losses from property dispositions and other transactions related to the food service business 
gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements 
the company s purchase and sale of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates is aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market 
these transactions are an integral part of our franchising business and resulting gains are recorded in operating income 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses the company actively participates in  but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes  except for us restaurant partnerships  which are reported before income taxes 
net gains or losses from property dispositions result from disposals of properties due to restaurant closings  relocations and other transactions 
the increase in other operating income in was principally due to the million asset impairment charge related to certain restaurant sites in mexico and the million special charge 
the special charge related primarily to plans to strengthen the us business and reduce ongoing costs by closing approximately low volume us satellite restaurants  replacing certain restaurant equipment  outsourcing excess property management and implementing other cost efficiencies 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates declined in and due to the weakening japanese yen and increased ownership of certain foreign markets  changing their classification from affiliates to majority or wholly owned subsidiaries 
additionally in  gains on sales of restaurant businesses were lower  whereas in  they were higher than the previous year 
lower provisions for property dispositions increased other operating income in  compared with operating income operating income increased million or to billion in  and million or to billion in excluding the asset impairment and special charges  operating income increased in and in the increases in and were due to higher combined operating margin dollars  offset in part by weaker foreign currencies  higher selling  general and administrative expenses  and in  lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses

outside the us  operating income rose million or in and million or in this growth was driven by higher combined operating margin dollars resulting from expansion in and in both years  weaker foreign currencies and higher selling  general and administrative expenses partly offset these increases 
in  the deutsche mark  french franc and japanese yen were the primary currencies affecting reported results

latin america s operating income increased million in and decreased million in  excluding the million asset impairment charge for mexico in continued expansion of the restaurant base  as well as an increase in constant currency comparable sales  drove improved results across this segment 
interest expense higher average debt levels  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and lower average interest rates  accounted for the and increases in interest expense 
nonoperating income expense net nonoperating income expense net includes interest income  gains and losses related to other investments and financings  and miscellaneous income and expense 
in  interest income and translation gains were lower than in in  translation gains were higher than in additionally  this category included losses of million in and million in associated with the reduction of the carrying value of the company s investment in discovery zone common stock to zero

in  net income increased  while net income per common share and net income per common share on a diluted basis increased 
the spread between the percent increases in net income and net income per common share in each year reflected the positive effects of share repurchases and lower preferred dividends compared with the prior year

the increase in capital expenditures for existing restaurants in was primarily due to additional remodels and rebuilds of certain older restaurants 
other properties primarily included expenditures for office buildings and related computer equipment and furnishings 
in the us  average development costs for traditional restaurants  which include land  building and equipment costs  increased in to  compared with  in and  in the increases were primarily due to higher site development and preparation costs 
average development costs for traditional restaurants in our major markets outside the us  excluding japan  were approximately million in average costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market 
these costs are managed through the use of smaller restaurants in some countries  construction and design efficiencies  standardization and global sourcing 
the company intends to continue managing development costs relative to sales volumes through greater economies of scale globally and through co branded oil locations  primarily in the us our objective is to profitably expand  consistent with our goal of increasing market share  and achieve greater marketwide presence throughout the world 
accordingly  the company will continue to investigate opportunities to employ capital in its us business most effectively 
the trend in the us is to lease more sites 
outside the us  property is purchased when legally and economically feasible  otherwise  long term leases are used 
including affiliates  total real estate ownership was and at year end and  respectively 
capital expenditures made by affiliates which were not included in consolidated amounts were approximately million in  compared with million in the decrease was partly due to weaker foreign currencies and our increased ownership in chile and singapore  converting them from affiliates to majority or wholly owned subsidiaries 
expansion in argentina  japan  korea  the philippines and sweden continued to drive affiliate capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating and discretionary spending requirements 
free cash flow grew to million in  compared with million in cash provided by operations decreased slightly in  primarily due to the one time refund of us franchisee security deposits of approximately million 
excluding the effect of the refunds  cash provided by operations increased million or 
cash provided by operations  along with other sources of cash such as borrowings  was used principally for capital expenditures  debt repayments  share repurchase and dividends 
cash provided by operations exceeded capital expenditures in for the seventh consecutive year and is expected to more than cover capital expenditures over the next several years 
dollars in millions cash provided by operations      free cash flow cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations as a percent of average total debt in addition to its free cash flow  the company can meet short term needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements 
accordingly  the company maintains a relatively low current ratio 
at year end financings and market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
mcdonald s strives to minimize these risks by financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated and employing established policies and procedures to manage this exposure 
see pages and for additional information 
the company uses major capital markets and various techniques to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
for example  currency exchange agreements in conjunction with borrowings help obtain desired currencies at attractive rates and maturities 
interest rate exchange agreements effectively convert fixed rate to floating rate debt  or vice versa 
we also manage the level of fixed rate debt to take advantage of changes in interest rates 
the company uses foreign currency debt to hedge intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on net income and shareholders equity 
total foreign denominated debt  including the effects of currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
as a percent fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt weighted average annual interest rate of total debt foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt total debt as a percent of total capitalization total debt and total shareholders equity moody s and standard poor s have rated mcdonald s debt aa and aa  respectively  since duff phelps began rating the debt in and currently rates it aa 
these strong ratings are important to the company because of our global development plans 
the company has not experienced  nor does it expect to experience  difficulty obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
at year end  the company and its subsidiaries had billion available under committed line of credit agreements and billion under shelf registrations for future debt issuance 
in january  the company issued million debentures at due and million medium term notes at due under the shelf registrations 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements  and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
the company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on reported results and to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the us in addition  where practical  mcdonald s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges  and the company typically finances in local currencies  creating economic hedges 
the company s exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
at year end and  assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in us dollars 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities were as follows december in millions of us dollars british pounds sterling canadian dollars australian dollars brazilian reais french francs hong kong dollars austrian schillings brazil was considered a hyperinflationary market at december  the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from year end levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from year end levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
total shareholders equity total shareholders equity rose million or in  and represented of total assets at year end 
weaker foreign currencies decreased shareholders equity by million in one way to enhance common shareholder value is by using free cash flow and debt capacity to repurchase shares 
since  the company has invested billion to buy back million shares at an average price of approximately  while maintaining a strong equity base 
at year end  the company held million shares in treasury with a market value of billion 
in january  the company announced plans to repurchase billion of its common stock by year end as of year end  we had purchased billion of this amount  including million shares for million in the company repurchased a total of million of its common stock in  million of which completed our previous share repurchase program 
returns operating income is used to compute return on average assets  while net income less preferred stock dividends net of applicable taxes is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
as a percent return on average assets return on average common equity includes the million special charge 
return on assets declined in  as the increase in average assets outpaced the growth in operating income 
return on common equity also declined in  as the increase in average equity exceeded net income growth 
other matters effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made cheaper by inflation 
in hyperinflationary markets  menu board prices are typically adjusted to keep pace with inflation  mitigating the effect on reported results 
year many computer systems and applications currently use two digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all  which could cause miscalculations or system failures 
the company has assessed its computerized systems to determine their ability to correctly identify the year and is devoting the necessary internal and external resources to replace  upgrade or modify all significant systems which do not correctly identify the year we anticipate that all of our systems will be year compliant well before the end of in addition  the company has determined the extent to which its operations may be affected by the compliance efforts of its significant suppliers and is taking the necessary steps to minimize problems 
based on current information  the costs of addressing the year issue have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
