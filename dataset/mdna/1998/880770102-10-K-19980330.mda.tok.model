recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is the change in equity of an entity during a period from transactions and other events from non owner sources  such as the cumulative effects from changes in accounting principles and changes in equity due to fluctuating currency and investments 
this statement requires that changes in comprehensive income be shown in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
the statement is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and the company will adopt its provisions in fiscal reclassification for earlier periods is required for comparative purposes 
management does not expect the statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  which changes the manner in which public companies report information about their operating segments 
sfas no 
 which is based on the management approach to segment reporting  establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report entity wide disclosures about products and services  major customers  and the geographic locations in which the entity holds assets and reports revenue 
management is currently evaluating the effects of this change on its reporting of segment information 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for its fiscal year ending december  in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions and supercedes sop  software revenue recognition 
sop is effective for transactions entered into beginning in management does not expect the statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and the company s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to the company s delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditure  may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
the most recent downturn  which occurred in  contributed to a decline in semiconductor test system orders 
there can be no assurance that any future increase in semiconductor test systems bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
also  the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company is notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or assertions of patent infringement against the company which are ultimately successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
lengthy and expensive defense of the company s rights to technology used in its products could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into product  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to the company s success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
the company faces substantial competition throughout the world  primarily from electronic test systems manufacturers located in the united states  europe and japan  as well as several of the company s customers 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
certain of the company s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those currently offered by the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states 
international sales are subject to significant risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the company s markets  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in the recent past there has been significant economic instability in several countries in asia 
continued economic instability would increase the likelihood of either a direct or indirect adverse impact on the company s future results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  fulfilling backlog on a timely basis  reliance on sole source suppliers  potential retrofit costs  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
in particular  the company has introduced a significant number of new  complex test systems in and  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience delays in shipment of such products or that such products will achieve customer acceptance 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year therefore  some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company is assessing both the internal readiness of its computer systems and the compliance of its computer products and software sold to customers for handling the year the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues  and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations
