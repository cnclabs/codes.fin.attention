the company through its european operations is exposed to foreign currency risk in most western european countries  principally france  spain  germany  italy and the uk the company does not have material operations in countries whose economies can be classified as hyper inflationary 
movements of exchange rates vis a vis the us dollar can result in both unrealized and realized exchange gains or losses 
in some instances gains in one currency may be offset by losses in another as all currencies may not move in unison vis a vis the us dollar 
it is the policy of the company to reduce foreign currency risk by balancing net foreign currency positions where possible 
in addition  the company enters into foreign exchange contracts  including forward and purchased option contracts 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities  as well as certain firm commitments and highly anticipated cash flows 
the company also enters into purchased option contracts which  if exercised  involve the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate for a specified time 
as of march   the net fair value of open foreign exchange contracts and the related gains and losses were not material

seasonality and weather the automotive aftermarket is seasonal as retail sales of replacement batteries are generally higher in the fall and winter the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
accordingly  demand for the company s automotive batteries is generally highest in the fall and early winter as retailers build inventories in anticipation of the winter season 
european sales are concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter the company s third quarter  due to the shipment of batteries for the winter season and the practice of many industrial battery customers particularly governmental and quasi governmental entities of deferring purchasing decisions until the end of the calendar year 
demand for automotive batteries is significantly affected by weather conditions 
unusually cold winters or hot summers accelerate battery failure and increase demand for automotive replacement batteries 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of its seasonal working capital needs  obligations on its indebtedness and capital expenditures 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through operating cash flows  with borrowed funds and the proceeds of sales of accounts receivable 
the company is party to a us receivables purchase agreement and a european receivables purchase agreement under which the other parties have committed subject to certain exceptions to purchase selected accounts receivable of the company  up to a maximum commitment of million and million  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company s greatest cash demands from operations occur during the months of june through october 
during fiscal and beyond  the company also expects to meets its liquidity requirements in the same manner 
cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  more funds are typically generated in its third and fourth fiscal quarters 
during fiscal  million of cash provided from operations was due to sales of european accounts receivable 
offsetting this was the payment of million for the company s european restructuring activities  primarily severance associated with plant closures 
during fiscal  the company closed five plants in europe 
all of this is part of the company s long term strategy of reducing its manufacturing and distribution cost structure  especially in europe 
in the next several years  the company will continue to complete the closure of various european plants which will necessitate cash payments for severance and other closure costs 
while the company believes that a large portion of its cash requirements for its european consolidation activities will be generated from operations  it has substantial liquidity and capital resources through its senior secured global credit facilities agreement  as discussed below 
the company s capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal   and were principally due to the european acquisitions and the acquisition of schuylkill metals in fiscal and on going capital expenditures in europe and north america 
the senior secured global credit facilities agreement restricts the amount of capital expenditures which may be made by the company and its subsidiaries 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
however  the company believes that it has sufficient resources for its capital expenditure programs from operating cash flows and borrowing availability under its existing credit agreements 
as of march   the company had million outstanding on its senior secured global credit facilities agreement  including letters of credit 
obligations under the senior secured global credit facilities agreement bear interest at fluctuating rates 
increases in interest rates on such obligations could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the senior secured global credit facilities agreement is fully secured by guarantees of the european subsidiaries and certain fixed assets  inventory and receivables 
the company has an interest rate collar agreement which reduces the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the company s floating rate debt 
the collar agreement effectively limits the pibor base interest rate on million french francs us million of borrowings to no more than and no less than through december  the company has two currency and interest rate swap agreements which effectively converts million of borrowings under the senior secured global credit facilities agreement into million french francs us million and million british pound sterling us million 
the company receives libor and pays pibor and pound sterling libor 
additionally  the company entered into a series of bond swaps agreements which effectively converted million principal amount of the senior notes into a variable libor interest rate through april  the company has the right to terminate the million bond swap agreements at any time before maturity 
as of march   the company had million available under its senior secured global credit facilities agreement after consideration of million of outstanding letters of credit 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
as of march   the company has significant nol carryforwards in europe and in the united states which are available  subject to certain restrictions  to offset future us and european taxable income

year issue the year issue results from the fact that some computer systems and applications utilizing two digit date fields to designate years may not correctly interpret the year as a result  some date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all  which may cause systems to process financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company has assessed the impact of the year issue  including cost estimates to complete required changes 
plans to address the year issue have been developed and are being implemented 
currently  the company does not expect that the costs to be incurred will be material to the results of operations or financial condition  and expects all affected systems and applications to be modified or replaced in advance of the year recently issued accounting standards in the second quarter of fiscal  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company will be required to adopt these new standards in fiscal these new pronouncements will be a change in the currently required disclosures to the consolidated financial statements  which the company is currently in the process of determining 
effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the operations of the company during the past three years 
the company generally has been able to offset the effects of inflation with price increases  cost reduction programs and operating efficiencies 
future environmental developments the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the future environmental  health and safety standards may be more stringent 
the company anticipates that such potential standards could cause an increase in the company s capital expenditures and operating costs 
unless and until the standards are adopted it is not possible to estimate these costs with any certainty or to predict whether they will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
