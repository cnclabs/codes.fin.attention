the company received approximately new single family orders under the programs 
production activities for these orders should benefit the company by better utilization of available plant capacity resulting in more favorable manufacturing overhead absorption 
however  as these units are delivered and set over the first three quarters of  promotional related discounts will adversely impact the gross margin percent 
in addition to the winter promotional programs  the company com pleted the construction of inventory units which are available to the builder dealer network for immediate sale

the company anticipates that the stronger backlog at mid march   and improved performance at shagawa resort  inc will assist the company in exceed ing results 
however  due to the seasonal nature of both the manufac turing and hospitality industries  the company s earnings are adversely affected during the winter months and gain momentum as the summer months approach

cash flows to support the referenced activities were primarily provided by utilizing the company s year end cash and cash equivalents position  inventory re duction  internally generated income  non cash depreciation  amortization and tax deferrals and several long term financing arrangements 
the company s consolidated working capital increased  to  from  at the end of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  to  at year end  primarily due to a plant expansion  acquisition of transportation equipment and operating assets acquired from the prior managing agent at shagawa resort  inc long term debt and capital leases  net of current maturities  increased from  at year end to  at year end long term debt consists primarily of a long term mortgage loan  which is secured by sub stantially all assets of shagawa resort  inc  with a partial guarantee of the small business administration  two capitalized lease obligations secured by transportation equipment  a restructured long term financing arrangement secured by a mortgage in support of the detroit lakes plant expansion and a contract for deed covering the purchase of land and a warehouse 
on april   the company retired all outstanding debt associated with the industrial revenue bonds which initially financed a major portion of the property and equipment for the company s manufacturing facility 
the debt requirement was required to provide collateral for the restructured long term financing arrangement 
the new financing arrangement is a composite of three funding sources which provided the manufacturing facility with  of proceeds and were used for financing the plant expansion  including equipment and work ing capital for additional inventory requirements 
debt retirement associated with the plant expansion and transportation equipment varies in maturity from five to fifteen years  dependent on the funding source 
the consolidated ratio of long term debt to stockholders equity changed from 
to at december  to 
to at december  and 
to at december  the change in the ratio reflects the accumulated debt acquired to finance transportation equipment  plant expansion and the shagawa resort facility 
stockholders equity  net of treasury stock  increased by  to  at december   from  at december  dynamic homes  inc has available a line of credit which is collateralized by inventories and receivables 
the credit available is based upon specified percentages of inventory and receivables 
on april   the company renewed its credit line for a period of one year under similar conditions and without any compensating balance requirements 
the renewed credit line has a maximum available borrowing of  at an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate and exempts short term letters of credit from reducing the available line of credit 
as of december   the company did not have any outstanding borrowings under the line of credit or any outstanding letters of credit 
shagawa resort  inc does not have any operating line of credit available 
consequently  shagawa resort  inc is dependent on dynamic homes  inc 
parent as its source of additional funds 
periodically  dynamic homes  inc is required to advance funds  during the slower winter months  to support the resort s ongoing operations 
however  during the stronger summer months  the resort generates adequate levels of funds to support its operational require ments and reduce the level of these outstanding advances 
the company recognizes the importance of the year issue and has been focusing on the nature and extent of these potential problems both internally and externally 
the majority of the company s operating systems and software are current and are date sensitive 
however  the company has identified and undertaken steps to address potential deficiencies associated with an inventory costing system 
the company is anticipating that a revised system will be functional by year end and corrective expenditures are not anticipated to materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company engages in limited electronic commerce with its sup pliers and has available several sources of supply 
consequently  the company believes it has minimal risk regarding supplier compliance 
the company continues to market shagawa resort  inc to prospective buyers with the ultimate goal of transacting a sale in the short term future 
although no serious discussions are progressing at this time  future opportu nities may surface which deem it to be in the company s best interest to divest of the property 
transactions of this type potentially could materially affect the company s short term operating results and capital resources 
however  management anticipates that the normal operating cycle will generate suf ficient cash  in conjunction with short term borrowings on its existing credit line and supplemented by long term financing and capital leases to provide adequate funds to support the company s operations and scheduled capital requirements during statements regarding the company s operations  performance and financial condition are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
these risks and un certainties include but are not limited to rising mortgage interest rates and or weakness in regional and national economic conditions that could have an adverse impact on new home and multi family commercial sales 
likewise  future escalating and volatile material costs and unfavorable weather con ditions could also affect the company s profit levels
