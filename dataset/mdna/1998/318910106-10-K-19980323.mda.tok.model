this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
all per share amounts for periods prior to june  have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on september  to shareholders of record on august  the company adopted the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standard number  earnings per share sfas no 
as of december  sfas no 
requires the company to disclose two earnings per share amounts basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share uses the weighted average common shares outstanding as the denominator in per share calculations  while diluted earnings per share includes the potentially dilutive incremental share effects of options that have been issued under the company s stock option plan 
as required by sfas no 
 all prior year earnings per share amounts have been restated and computed under the provisions of the new standard 
see the accounting changes section of management s discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this new standard 
unless otherwise noted  per share disclosures are based on the basic earnings per share calculation 
mergers and acquisitions on november   first bank acquired a first union banking branch located in lillington  north carolina 
real and personal property acquired totaled approximately  and deposits assumed totaled approximately  no loans were included in the purchase 
in the fourth quarter of  first bank completed its cash acquisition of the laurinburg and rockingham branch offices of first scotland bank 
assets acquired were approximately million including earning assets of approximately million  of which approximately million were loans 
deposit liabilities assumed were approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company completed its cash acquisition of central state bank in high point  north carolina 
central state had approximately million in assets with earning assets of approximately million  including approximately million in loans 
central state also had approximately million in deposits 
for additional information on these acquisitions  please see analysis of results of operations and analysis of financial condition below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the loan loss provision  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  fdic insurance assessments and other overhead costs  and the effect of income taxes 
overview compared to first bancorp s net income for was a record  or basic earnings per share of  compared to  or basic earnings per share of  for this represents a increase in net income and basic earnings per share over the prior year 
excluding the after tax effects of nonrecurring gains of  or per share  in the fourth quarter of related to an early termination fee of a data processing contract and  or per share  in the third quarter of related to a branch sale  the increase in net income and basic earnings per share would have been over the primary reason for the increase in net income in was a increase in net interest income that was a result of strong loan and deposit growth 
the provision for loan losses increased over the prior year  which is primarily a reflection of the company providing for the loan growth experienced during the year 
noninterest income decreased for the year and noninterest expenses increased for the year 
see additional discussion below 
overview compared to net income for was  or basic earnings per share of  compared to  or basic earnings per share of  for the primary reason for the significant increase in net income for was the absence of two nonrecurring events that the company experienced in the company incurred pretax nonrecurring charges totaling   or per share  on an after tax basis in the fourth quarter of related to a litigation settlement  pretax in additional provision for loan losses and  pretax in out of pocket settlement costs and unrelated severance expenses related to two former senior managers  pretax 
in addition to the nonrecurring fourth quarter charges  during  the company incurred  pretax in legal fees related to the litigation that are included in noninterest expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the nonrecurring gain from a branch sale discussed above and the nonrecurring charges and related expenses incurred in  the company s net income increased approximately on a tax effected basis in compared to excluding the effects of the nonrecurring charges and related expenses  first bancorp experienced the following variances during compared to net interest income increased  noninterest income increased  the provision for loan losses decreased  and noninterest expenses increased net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis amounted to  in   in and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in these increases were primarily a result of a increase in average earning assets during and an increase in additionally  in the yield realized on earning assets increased by basis points from  while the average yield the company paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by only basis points  resulting in an increase in net interest margin net yield on interest earning assets of basis points to from the yield realized in the increase in yield realized on earning assets was primarily affected by a basis point increase in the yield realized on loans that was largely a result of the basis point increase in the bank s prime lending rate that occurred in march and remained in effect for the remainder of the year 
the average rate paid on deposits  although basis points higher in  was favorably impacted by higher growth in lower yielding savings  now  and money market deposits growth versus higher yielding time deposits growth 
in  the company s net interest margin decreased by basis points to from as a result of a slight compression of both average yields earned and average rates paid 
the average yield earned on loans decreased basis points to  primarily as a result of a lower average prime rate in effect during the year 
this was largely offset by a basis point increase in the yield realized on taxable securities 
this increase in yield was primarily a result of a strategic decision by the company to invest in higher yielding securities with longer maturities 
the average yield on deposits increased by basis points to during changes in total interest income and total interest expense result from changes in both volumes and rates in the related earning asset and interest bearing liability categories 
table shows the quantitative effects on net interest income of the changes in volumes and rates experienced by the company 
as discussed above and illustrated in table  changes in volumes have been the primary cause of changes in the amounts of interest income and interest expense recorded by the company 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company made provisions for loan losses of  for compared to  for and  for the increase in the provision for loan losses in was largely in response to the high volume of loan growth experienced by the company  as the company s asset quality ratios improved during the company originated million in new loans  net of repayments  in as compared to million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to is attributable to the company providing approximately  in for the purpose of replenishing the allowance for loan losses that was depleted because of charge offs of loans related to the parties involved in the litigation that was settled on december  management made the determination to record these charge offs as a result of the related settlement negotiations 
for additional information  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see summary of loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the bank s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income amounted to  in  a decrease from  in the amount was  or  higher than the  recorded in the decrease in noninterest income in from was partially due to a decrease in nonrecurring gains of  and changes in gains and losses from securities sales of  in  the company sold one branch office  along with its loans and deposits  and sold a vacated building which resulted in a net nonrecurring gain of  in  montgomery data realized a nonrecurring gain of  as a result of its last nonaffiliated customer terminating its data processing agreement prior to its contractually obligated term  and thus having to pay an early termination penalty 
management of montgomery data does not intend to aggressively seek additional customers at this time  but plans instead to use existing capacity to meet the increasing requirements of the bank resulting from its asset growth 
notwithstanding the foregoing  additional customers may be taken on if it is deemed to be in the best interest of the company 
service charges on deposit accounts amounted to  in   in and  in other service charges  commissions  and fees amounted to  in   in and  in a factor in the decrease in service charges from to relates to the bank s decision during to increase fees for certain services to make them more commensurate with the related expenses the bank incurred in providing the services 
also  an internal emphasis was placed on collecting the fees for all such services 
this initially had the effect of increasing gross service fee revenue which resulted in higher total service charge revenues in as compared to subsequently  management believes customers became more cognizant of the higher fees and made efforts to reduce their use of these services  which resulted in a decline in these same revenues for the bank during compared to commissions from insurance sales decreased by  in and  in as a result of lower commission fee rates negotiated with brokers  as well as a higher percentage of the bank s customers utilizing their home equity lines of credit to finance consumer purchases versus obtaining consumer installment loans  where the bank has typically brokered more insurance policies 
the increase in noninterest income from to was primarily a result of the nonrecurring gain and increased service charge fees discussed above 
table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses were  in   in  and  in the increase in noninterest expenses during was primarily a result of the bank opening three new branches early in and a fourth late in these new branches were largely responsible for the increases in personnel expense  occupancy expense  equipment expense  stationery expense  and telephone expense during the year 
the decrease was primarily due to the absence of the two previously discussed nonrecurring events that occurred in that resulted in charges of  in severance related personnel expenses   in litigation settlement  and  in legal fees related to the litigation settlement 
for additional information regarding the litigation settlement  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effects of these nonrecurring charges and related expenses  noninterest expenses increased by in compared to  which was primarily a result of a full year of expenses related to the company s acquisition of two branches in the fourth quarter of that was previously discussed 
table sets forth the principal components of noninterest expenses 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in tax expense in compared to is a result of a increase in pretax income  as the company s effective tax rate remained constant at 
the increase in tax expense in was due to an increase in pretax income as well as an increase in state income taxes paid 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition the following discussion focuses on the factors considered by management to be important in assessing the company s financial condition 
the company s assets and deposits have continued to grow  reflecting growth in existing markets and expansion into new geographic areas 
total assets were million at december   an increase of over december  assets during grew to million at year end  a increase over the million at december  interest earning assets at december  were million  an increase of over the million held at december  the amount was higher that the million held at december  loans  the primary interest earning asset  grew to million in compared to growth in funding the asset growth was a million  or  increase in deposits 
funding the asset growth was a million  or  increase in deposits 
approximately million of the asset and deposit growth can be attributed to the previously mentioned purchase of the first union bank branch located in lillington  nc partially offsetting the growth was the july sale of a branch with loans of million and deposits of million 
the company s assets and deposits have experienced compound annual growth rates of approximately over the last five years 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance is the shift in asset mix from securities to loans that is primarily due to strong loan growth that was partially funded with proceeds from securities maturities and sales 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in year end securities at december  as compared to is due to the company investing more funds in overnight cash investments at year end to fund the strong loan demand experienced by the company near year end  as well as the lack of yield incentive to invest in securities with maturities longer than overnight due to the flattening of the yield curve 
the increase in year end securities at year end versus was a result of the company having more of its excess cash invested in securities as opposed to overnight cash investments  as well as overall balance sheet growth 
average total securities were approximately million during as compared to an average of million in and million in the increase in the average balance of securities during was due to a higher level of funds provided by the slightly higher growth in the amount of average deposits during the year versus average loans  as well as funds provided by earnings of the company 
the relatively small increase in average securities of million during compared to is a result of the growth in average loans almost completely offsetting the funds provided by the growth in average deposits 
the composition of the securities portfolios at december    and reflects a shift in and from us treasuries to higher yielding collateralized mortgage obligations 
all of the company s collateralized mortgage obligations at each year end were issued by fannie mae or freddie mac 
at each year end  there were no collateralized mortgage obligations considered to be high risk pursuant to existing bank regulatory guidelines 
at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  and net unrealized gains of  at december  management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as of december    and  respectively 
the market value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  exceeded their carrying value by  at december    at december   and  in management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  approximately of the available for sale portfolio matures within years  with the weighted average contractual life being years 
the weighted average tax equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the weighted average life of the securities held to maturity portfolio was years at december  with a weighted average taxable equivalent yield of 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and approximate market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the collateralized mortgage obligations previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
loans increased by million  or  in to million from the million balance at december  the year end amount was higher than the million balance at december  the loan growth experienced by the company in occurred in all significant loan categories  while the growth was limited to the real estate mortgage and real estate construction categories 
a large portion of the company s loan portfolio has historically been comprised of loans secured by various types of real estate 
at december   million or of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on other types of real estate 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  broken out between fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans 
approximately of the bank s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
these percentages are approximately the same as they were at december  the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  compared to and as of december  the bank intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
the yield on performing loans as of december  was compared to at december  and at december  the slight increase in yield at december  is a result of a higher prime rate in effect at year end offset by the company s trend in the second half of the year of originating larger balance loans with slightly lower yields 
the decrease in yield from to is primarily a result of a lower prime rate in effect at the respective year ends 
see additional information regarding interest rate risk below 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no such loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes highly probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to  and  at december    and respectively 
the decrease in nonperforming loans at december  as compared to december  is primarily attributable to the resolution of several relationships that resulted in partial charge offs during the year  as well as generally improved loan quality 
the increase in nonperforming loans at december  compared to december  was largely due to  more in loans on nonaccrual status that were assumed in corporate acquisitions occurring in and these nonaccrual loans that were originated by other institutions amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  these loans had a reduced risk of loss to the company because of certain loss reimbursement provisions contained in the acquisition agreements 
substantially all such loans were resolved during by means of receipt of payment in full from the borrower  foreclosure and disposition of collateral  or sale of the loan back to the original owner of the loan prior to the expirations of the reimbursement provisions of the agreements in as of december   the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being approximately  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts included above  management believes that an estimated  of loans that are currently performing in accordance with their contractual terms may potentially develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties amounted to  at december   compared to  at december  and  at december  approximately  of the decrease from relates to the disposition of properties assumed in the central state acquisition 
foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties represented  and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management has reviewed recent appraisals of these properties and has concluded that their fair values  less estimated costs to sell  exceeds the respective carrying values at december  allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio including off balance sheet commitments  evaluation of possible future losses and current economic conditions 
the bank uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of possible future loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the bank s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the program evaluates a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  as of december  as compared to  at december  and  at december  this represented   and of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at year end is a result of generally improved loan quality  as well as the resolution during of several large nonaccrual and problem loans that resulted in partial charge offs 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans amounted to at december  as compared to at december   and at december  table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to known weaknesses in the loan portfolio decreased from  at december  to  at december  the year end amount was virtually unchanged from the  at december  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover possible loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about future economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category  and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and  respectively 
as previously discussed  during the company resolved several large nonperforming loans that resulted in partial charge offs 
charge offs in included approximately  of loans related to the parties involved in the litigation that was settled on december  for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits for grew by over the average to million 
the average amount of deposits was million  a increase from the category of deposits with the largest percentage increase during was interest bearing demand deposits  which increased by 
this increase can be partially attributed to the company restructuring several of its accounts within this category to offer more competitive rates 
this resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits for the year 
for  average savings accounts increased by  average time deposits increased by  and average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  over the averages from in  average interest bearing demand deposits increased by  average savings accounts increased by  average time deposits increased by  and average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  over the averages from the company has a large  stable base of time deposits with little dependence on volatile deposits of  or more 
the time deposits are principally certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts obtained from individual customers 
deposits of certain local governments and municipal entities represented of the bank s total deposits at december  all such public funds are collateralized by investment securities 
the company does not purchase brokered deposits 
as of december   the company held approximately  in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of  table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past ten years the net interest margin has not varied by more than basis points in any single year and the lowest net interest margin realized over that same period is within basis points of the highest 
while the company can not guarantee similar stability in the net interest margin in the future  at this time  management does not expect significant fluctuations 
see additional discussion of the company s net interest margin in the net interest income above 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  as illustrated by this table  the company has million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that near term net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates 
as of december   approximately of interest earning assets could be repriced within five years and substantially all interest bearing liabilities could be repriced within five years 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s fixed rate earning assets have estimated fair values that are slightly higher than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being slightly higher than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios due to a generally declining interest rate environment at year end 
the estimated fair value of the company s time deposits is higher than its book value for the same reason 
off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
these commitments are not recorded as an asset or liability until exercised 
as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
additionally  standby letters of credit of approximately  and  were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to credit loss for the aforementioned commitments in the event of nonperformance by the party to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
the type of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects these commitments  if drawn  to be funded through normal operations 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in derivatives activities 
return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends declared per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the return on assets and return on equity ratios for were significantly impacted by the nonrecurring charges previously discussed 
liquidity the company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
see business supervision and regulation and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain reserve requirements  pay expenses and operate the bank on an ongoing basis 
the bank s primary liquidity sources are cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  as well as the securities available for sale portfolio 
the company also has in place available lines of credit totaling  should funding or liquidity needs arise 
these lines of credit are secured by the company s federal home loan bank stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
the company also has correspondent bank relationships established that allow the company to purchase up to  in federal funds on an overnight basis 
the bank typically has not had to rely on the purchase of federal funds as a source of liquidity 
the bank s management believes its liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs 
capital resources the company is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve board frb and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the bank is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the north carolina state banking commission 
the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the frb and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on both the company s and the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in frb and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company is subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the frb has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
at december  and  the company was in compliance with all existing capital requirements  as summarized in table see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
year issue as has been widely reported in the media  many of the world s existing computer programs use only two digits to identify the year in the date field of a program 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and could experience serious malfunctions when the last two digits of the year change to year issue 
due to the highly automated and computerized nature of the company s transaction processing and operations as a whole  the company is taking the year issue very seriously 
the company s technology committee  which is comprised of a cross section of the company s employees  is leading the company s year efforts and involving all employees of the company in ensuring that the company is properly prepared for the year the company uses third party software vendors for most of its computer programs and micro chip related processes 
the first phase of the company s efforts to address the year issue was to inventory all known company processes that could reasonably be expected to be impacted by the year issue and their related vendors  if applicable 
this inventory of processes and vendors included not only typical computer processes such as the company s transaction applications systems  but all known processes that could be impacted by micro chip malfunctions 
these include but are not limited to the company s alarm system  phone system  check ordering process  and atm network 
the company s second phase in addressing the year issue was to contact all such vendors and request documentation regarding their year compliance efforts 
this phase is now virtually complete and the company is currently analyzing the responses 
the next phase for the company is to implement a comprehensive testing of all known processes 
initially  processes will be tested on a stand alone basis and then the testing will involve multiple interfacing processes 
all testing is scheduled to be completed by the end of management plans for any corrective actions to be implemented to ensure that the company is fully prepared for the year by the end of the first quarter of to date the company has not identified any processes that will require significant expenditures to address the year issue 
currently  the company s estimate of the range of total costs to address the year issue is  to  the majority of these costs are expected to be incurred and expensed by the company in inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
accounting changes the company prepares its financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposed new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
the only new standard adopted during that significantly changed the way the company has prepared its financial statements was the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  which is discussed in the following paragraph 
the company adopted statement of financial standard number  earnings per share sfas no 
as of december  sfas no 
superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share apb no 
which the company had properly followed until the adoption of sfas no 
for companies that have potentially issuable stock complex capital structures  such as the company because of its stock option plan  sfas no 
requires that two earnings per share amounts be disclosed basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period 
the basic earnings per share computation for the company is the same method the company previously used to calculate and report earnings per share under apb no 
diluted earnings per share is computed by assuming the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period 
currently  the company s only dilutive potential common stock issuances relate to options issued under the company s stock option plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the stock option plan 
in computing diluted earnings per share  it is assumed that all such dilutive stock options are exercised during the reporting period at their respective exercise prices  with the proceeds from the exercises used by the company to buy back stock in the open market at the average market price in effect during the reporting period 
the difference between the number of options assumed to be exercised and the number of shares bought back is added to the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period 
the sum is used as the denominator to calculate diluted earnings per share for the company 
the fasb has also issued three new standards that must be adopted by the company for reporting periods beginning with the first quarter of those standards are discussed in the following three paragraphs 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period for non owner transactions and is divided into net income and other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income includes revenues  expenses  gains  and losses that are excluded from earnings under current accounting standards 
this statement does not change or modify the reporting or display in the income statement 
sfas no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  although early adoption is permitted 
comparative financial statements provided for earlier periods are required to be reclassified to reflect the application of this statement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statement requires management to report selected financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
generally  disclosures are required for segments internally identified to evaluate performance and resource allocation 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in the initial year of application  comparative information for prior periods is to be restated  if it is practical to do so 
sfas no 
does not have to be applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of application  but  comparative information must be provided for interim periods in the second year of application 
this statement is not expected to affect the company s financial statement presentation 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement standardizes the disclosure requirements of pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement does not change any measurement or recognition provisions  and thus will not materially impact the company 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  forward looking statements the foregoing discussion may contain statements that could be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act  which statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are statements that include projections  predictions  expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact 
such statements are often characterized by the use of qualifying words and their derivatives such as expect  believe  estimate  plan  project  or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of the company and its management about future events 
factors that could influence the accuracy of such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the financial success or changing strategies of the company s customers  actions of government regulators  the level of market interest rates  and general economic conditions
