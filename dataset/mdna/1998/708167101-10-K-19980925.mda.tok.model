item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank and its subsidiaries 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and operating expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
as noted previously  the deposits of savings associations  such as the bank  are presently insured by the saif  which  along with the bif  are the two insurance funds administered by the fdic 
financial institutions which were members of the bif  prior to september   experienced substantially lower deposit insurance premiums because the bif had achieved its required level of reserves while the saif had not yet achieved its required reserves 
as a result of legislation signed into law on september   the saif recapitalization plan provided for a one time assessment of of deposits which was imposed on all saif insured institutions to enable the saif to achieve its required level of reserves 
the assessment was based on deposits as of march   and the bank s special assessment was approximately million  or million  net of taxes 
accordingly  this special one time saif recapitalization assessment significantly increased non interest expenses and adversely affected the company s results of operations for the year ended june  following the recapitalization assessment  beginning january  deposit insurance premiums decreased significantly from the of deposits previously paid by the bank to plus the assessment to be paid to the fico 
such assessment for the quarterly period beginning july  amounted to of deposits  on an annualized basis

management strategy management s primary goal continues to be to improve profitability  while continuing to manage risks  including interest rate risk  so as to enhance stockholder value  and to foster and maintain customer confidence 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages with related sales of certain of these products in the secondary market  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company has emphasized  and plans to continue to emphasize  originating and purchasing traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located in new jersey 
correspondent loan purchases of one to four family mortgage loans have been primarily secured by properties located throughout new jersey with a limited purchase of loans secured by real estate located in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
the company originated or purchased million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans on residential real estate which totaled million or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  during fiscal  in an effort to manage prepayment risk  the company sold approximately million of one to four family mortgage loans  primarily year fixed rate mortgages 
going forward secondary market activities will be pursued  to enable the company to both manage risks and improve profitability 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company plans to increase its emphasis on commercial and multi family and consumer lending 
such loans reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
consumer loan originations totaled million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and collection efforts and aggressive marketing of real estate owned properties 
in addition  the company has occasionally restructured loans in order to return the loan to a performing status 
as a result  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was at june  compared to at june  increasing deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
deposits have increased  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company plans to continue to emphasize deposit growth  particularly transaction accounts 
emphasis will also continue on the solicitation of deposits from municipalities 
managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than weekly to price loan and deposit products and monthly to develop  implement and review policies to manage interest rate risk 
the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan and deposit products  including the focus on the origination of first mortgage products with shorter terms to maturity and or with adjustable rate features  as well as the origination of commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loans which generally have shorter expected average lives or reprice at shorter intervals than one to four family residential first mortgage products 
the company has also engaged in one to four family whole mortgage loan sales whereby longer term fixed rate conventional and fha loans have been sold to reduce the duration of its fixed rate loan portfolios 
in addition  the company has purchased government agency or callable securities with short to intermediate average lives which generally do not exceed years or which have adjustable rate features 
furthermore  as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized longer term certificates of deposit and checking products and utilized intermediate term borrowings 
the company has also engaged in intermediate term interest rate swaps designed to extend the maturities of short term certificates of deposit to three to five years 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company continues to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
for the year ended june   service charge income increased  or  compared to the prior year 
implementation of atm surcharging for non penn federal customers and growth in checking accounts contributed to the service charge income increase 
continued growth in checking  previously mentioned loan sales  sales of non deposit investment products and the introduction of an administrative fee for individual retirement accounts will further increase non interest income 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which include ongoing reviews of staffing levels  supplies  facilities and operations 
the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year excluding the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year excluding the effects of the saif assessment 
interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the finance group executive  the lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to have annual payment rates between and of the portfolio 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including cmos and remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes  based on historical information  that million or of savings accounts at june   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the remaining savings accounts are assumed to roll off over the first eighteen months 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit

the company s negative gap position improved slightly from june  as a significant portion of short term funding lengthened to an intermediate term through interest rate swaps 
new loan activity was strong and residential refinance activity steadily increased during the year 
second mortgage activity emphasized variable rate and medium term fixed rate products 
as a result of a significant flattening in the treasury yield curve  growth in short term certificates of deposit far out paced activity in the intermediate term products 
however  in an effort to lengthen the maturities of interest bearing liabilities  the company supplemented funding needs through the use of fhlb of new york medium term advances and engaged in interest rate swaps 
callable government agency securities  with final maturities of years or less  but initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter  have also been purchased to supplement loan growth and replace redeemed security balances 
such investments are anticipated to be called prior to their stated final maturities 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored by management through selected interest rate risk irr measures set forth by the ots 
the irr measures used by the ots include an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a low initial npv ratio or high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure was 
npv is also measured internally on a consolidated basis 
as of june   the company s initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions and  as such  generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk ie  higher post shock npv ratio and lower sensitivity measure than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s unconsolidated irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
at june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would decrease from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years  and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically sold a portion of its one to four family year fixed rate and adjustable rate whole mortgage loan portfolios in an effort to shorten their average lives and durations  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
going forward  secondary market activities with sales of one to four family mortgage loans to government agencies  private investors  and other financial institutions will be pursued 
the company has purchased government agency guaranteed investments with final maturities within years which are initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter 
such investments are expected to be called prior to their final maturities 
the company may continue to purchase such investments  as well as government agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities with an expected average life at purchase of years or less  as needed  in accordance with its strategic objectives 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate term fhlb of new york advances and interest rate swaps  subject to market conditions 
the company has also emphasized growth in core demand deposit accounts  as such funds are lower cost alternatives to certificates of deposit  and fhlb of new york advances and strengthening customer relationships 
in october  the company issued million of trust preferred securities 
the company used the proceeds from the sale of these securities for general corporate purposes including a million capital contribution to the bank to support growth 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was assertively employed to reduce the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
despite lower market rates  increased prepayments and a flatter treasury yield curve  of the growth experienced in one to four family first mortgages between june  and june  was accomplished in the adjustable rate portfolio 
sixty eight percent of the growth in the consumer lending portfolio is attributable to growth in variable rate home equity lines of credit 
adjustable rate commercial and multi family real estate loans increased from june   while fixed rate balances declined 
during fiscal  the company sold approximately million of one to four family residential mortgage loans  primarily year fixed rate product 
these sales were undertaken to reduce prepayment risk 
additionally  through the use of interest rate swaps  designed to synthetically lengthen the maturities of short term deposits  as well as growth in two through five year certificates of deposit  demand deposit accounts  fhlb of new york advances and other borrowings  medium and long term funds increased million from june   while short term funds increased million 
generally  the investment policy of the company is to invest funds not utilized in its lending activities or required for other corporate purposes among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the company s asset liability management policies 
investments generally include us treasury and government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the company s cost of funds responds more rapidly to changes in interest rates than its yield on earning assets due to the shorter terms of its funding portfolios 
consequently  the results of operations are influenced by the levels of short term interest rates 
the company offers a range of maturities on its deposit products at competitive rates and monitors the maturities on an ongoing basis 
additionally  the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
during fiscal  demand deposit accounts increased  or million 
the balances of savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  which represented approximately of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
collectively  each of these strategies resulted in a narrowing of the company s interest rate gap and a reduction in irr during fiscal management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives

      financial condition comparison of financial condition at june  and june  total assets increased million  or  to billion at june  from total assets of billion at june  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in investment securities and a million increase in net loans receivable  particularly in the company s one to four family first mortgage loan portfolio 
the increase in investment securities was partially due to the leveraging of proceeds from the trust preferred securities offering in october at june   net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  were billion compared to million at june  the asset growth was funded by the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities  an increase in retail deposits  additional medium term fhlb of new york advances and increased other borrowings as well as principal payments on mortgage backed securities and one to four family mortgage loan sales

the year ended june  included the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment which totaled million million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  the increase in the current year was due to an increase in average interest earning assets  primarily residential loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets were billion for the year ended june  compared to billion for the prior year 
the average yield earned on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended june  increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the increase in interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans was due to million increase in the average balance outstanding to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in the average balance on residential one to four family mortgage loans was partially offset by a decrease of in the average yield earned on this loan portfolio to for the year ended june  from the prior year 
interest on investment securities increased million for the year ended june  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the average balance outstanding and a increase in the average yield earned on these assets for the year ended june  interest income on the mortgage backed securities portfolio decreased million  or  for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities primarily reflects a million decrease in the average balance outstanding to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in total average deposits  primarily certificates of deposit  and fhlb of new york advances coupled with an increase in the company s cost of funds 
interest expense also increased due to the issuance of the trust preferred securities 
average deposits and borrowings increased million for the year ended june  compared to fiscal the average rate paid on deposits  borrowings and trust preferred securities increased to for the year ended june  from for the prior year 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income for the year ended june  was million  reflecting a slight increase from million recorded in the prior year 
the increase reflects the company s growth in assets  primarily in investment securities and residential one to four family mortgage loans 
the increase in net interest and dividend income was partially offset by a decline in the net interest rate spread as well as timing differences between the receipt of the proceeds from the trust preferred securities offering and full implementation of the company s investment strategy 
the net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the year ended june  were and  respectively  a decline from and  respectively  during the prior year 
for the year ended june   the decline in net interest rate spread and net interest margin was partially due to the addition of the trust preferred securities 
the declines in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin were also attributable to the flat yield curve environment recently experienced in which higher yielding loans pre paid at accelerated rates and were replaced by lower yielding loans 
since the company s liabilities generally reprice more quickly than its assets  net interest rate spread and net interest margin will likely decrease if interest rates rise 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses at june  of million showed an increase from the million at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was at june   compared to at june  non interest income 
for the year ended june   non interest income was million compared to million for the prior year 
gains of approximately  on the sale of million of one to four family mortgage loans  primarily year fixed rate loans  were reflected in the year ended june  these loan sales were undertaken to manage prepayment risk as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
in addition to these gains  growth in non interest income was primarily attained through the introduction of charging non customers for atm transactions  fees recorded for the origination of loans provided to other investors and an increase in service charges related to checking accounts 
furthermore  for the year ended june   the increase was partially attributable to a decrease in the net loss from real estate operations 
the net loss from real estate operations was  for the year ended june  compared to a net loss from real estate operations of  for the prior year 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses were million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
the year ended june  included million for the one time saif recapitalization assessment 
excluding the effects of the saif assessment  non interest expenses for the year ended june  were slightly lower than fiscal the company s non interest expenses as a percent of average assets declined to for the year ended june  from for the prior year  excluding the saif assessment 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  excluding the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment  income tax expense of million was recorded for the prior year

for the year ended june   net income was million  or per diluted share  including the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment 
the saif recapitalization assessment for the company totaled million  or an after tax cost of million  or per share on a diluted basis 
the results for the year ended june   excluding the effects of the saif assessment  would have compared favorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june  interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  the increase in the year ended june  was due to an increase in average interest earning assets  primarily residential loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets were billion for the year ended june  compared to million for the comparable prior fiscal year 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended june  increased million  or when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans was due to an increase of million in the average balance outstanding for the year ended june  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the average balance on residential one to four family mortgage loans was partially offset by a decrease of in the average yield earned on this loan portfolio for the year ended june  from the prior fiscal year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million for the year ended june   from million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in total average deposits and borrowings coupled with an increase in the company s cost of funds 
average deposits and borrowings increased million for the year ended june  compared to the period 
the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings increased to for the year ended june  from for the prior fiscal year 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income for the year ended june  was million  reflecting an increase from million recorded in the prior fiscal year 
the increase reflects the company s growth in assets  primarily in residential one to four family mortgage loans 
the net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the year ended june  were and  respectively  a decline from and  respectively  during fiscal while the interest rate environment of recent years has proven beneficial to many financial institutions  including the company  increases in market rates of interest generally adversely affect the net interest income of most financial institutions 
since the company s liabilities generally reprice more quickly than its assets  interest margins will likely decrease if interest rates rise 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the allowance for loan losses at june  of million is comparable to the june  level 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was at june   compared to at june  non interest income 
for the year ended june  non interest income was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was partially due to a  gain on sale of investments available for sale which was recorded in the year ended june  in addition  the decrease in the year ended june  was partially attributable to a net loss from real estate operations of  compared to a net gain from real estate operations of  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net gains from real estate operations was partially reflective of additional reserves established in accordance with internal policies and guidelines on real estate properties then owned by the company 
non interest income for the year ended june  included a  gain on sale of a property no longer used in operations 
non interest expenses 
the company s non interest expenses were million for the year ended june  non interest expenses for the year ended june  included million for the one time saif recapitalization assessment 
excluding this saif assessment  non interest expenses for the year ended june  would have been comparable to the million reported for the year ended june  the company s non interest expenses  excluding the saif assess ment  as a percent of average assets declined to for the year ended june  from for the prior fiscal year 
as noted above  beginning january  deposit insurance premiums decreased significantly from the of deposits previously paid by the bank 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
excluding the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment  income tax expense would have been million for fiscal the effective tax rate was for the year ended june  excluding the effect of the one time saif recapitalization assessment  the effective tax rate was for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  year the concern comprising the year issue has its basis in the fact that many existing computer programs have traditionally used only two digits to identify the year in many date fields 
the century representation has been largely assumed 
as a century change rapidly approaches  any misinterpretation over the proper meaning could cause logic and other software errors in various applications 
year readiness means being able to clearly discern and traverse the century boundary in all applications 
it is not  however  just a computer issue 
building  communications and environmental systems are also involved 
the issue is further compounded by the degree to which other entities such as bank customers and suppliers are successful in addressing this same issue 
the year issue affects virtually all organizations globally 
penn federal has been taking  as have most banking institutions  a proactive stance on this issue for several years 
a formal year project plan the year plan has been prepared and approved by the company s board of directors 
supplementing this plan is a detailed listing of areas of concentration 
the board of directors is updated on a monthly basis as to the status of all phases 
furthermore  an independent verification of progress is being performed on a quarterly basis 
a task force with representation from all divisions within the bank has been assembled to implement the year plan  under the direction of two senior vice presidents 
the task force continues to engage in a wide range of associated tasks 
these include informing bank personnel about the complexity of the issue  assessing its impact upon penn federal systems and applications and arranging for the remediation of affected items 
as the bank primarily runs software purchased from a few key vendors  the task force continues to meet and work closely with those vendors and suppliers to ensure a smooth transition into the next millennium 
by following a carefully prescribed plan  efforts to date have made substantial progress and the company is currently on target toward meeting its commitment in achieving year compliance for its mission critical systems 
systems critical to the operation of the company have been identified and are receiving top priority 
certain of the mission critical software elements are now compliant 
upgrades on other mission critical software have been received and installed and are in the process of being tested 
although a vendor may contend that its product is currently year compliant or has been remediated to be so  the company will not consider an entity to be year compliant until either the vendor certifies such to the company by providing a test results review or until the company has performed independent testing 
task force personnel are currently participating in the process of testing and verifying vendor changes 
management expects to have renovated and tested all necessary systems by the end of the first quarter of and believes that its level of preparedness for the project is appropriate 
members of the task force have responsibility for identifying a contingency plan for the different areas of software being tested in the event the year plan is not timely and successfully implemented 
if vendors for certain critical systems are unable to supply year compliant software upgrades  the use of an alternative vendor would be required to be pursued  at additional cost to the company 
certain non software items  such as the assurance of electrical power on january  is beyond the control of the company 
nevertheless  contingency plans for these items must be formalized 
the estimated cost for this effort is  the actual amount will be determined by managements s operational choices over the next few months 
this estimate includes approximately  of hardware and software cost upgrades 
the remaining  is estimated for software program consulting and remediation 
this estimate does not include manpower costs of company personnel associated with the task force  who retain their individual operational responsibli ties in addition to year duties 
no costs have been incurred to date 
the completion date and cost are based upon management s analysis of the information currently available to it
