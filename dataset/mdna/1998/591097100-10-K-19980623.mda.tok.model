although the company believes the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business  a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  whether oral or written  made by or on behalf of the company 
many of these factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by or on behalf of the company 
see also investment considerations below 
the purpose of the following discussion is to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of the company  including changes arising from recent acquisitions by the company  the timing and nature of which have significantly affected the company s results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis does not include a comparison of the financial condition and results of operation for the year ended march  to any prior periods 
the company s prior operations of designing  manufacturing and marketing electronic presentation products and color printers and related consumable products were sold in july and december and since april  the company consummated acquisitions and now operates recycling facilities in states 
in the opinion of management  any comparison of the results of operations for the year ended march  to prior periods would not provide information relevant to an assessment of the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report 
general metal management is one of the largest and fastest growing full service metals recyclers in the united states  with recycling facilities in states 
metal management is primarily engaged in the collection and processing of ferrous and non ferrous metals for resale to metals brokers  steel producers  and producers and processors of other metals 
the company collects industrial and obsolete scrap  processes it into reusable forms and supplies the recycled metals to its approximately customers  including mini mills  integrated steel mills  foundries and metals brokers 
since april the company has experienced significant growth  principally through acquisitions 
the company s revenues consist primarily of revenues derived from the sale and brokerage of scrap metals 
the company recognizes revenues from processed product sales at the time of shipment 
revenues related to brokerage sales are generally recognized upon receipt of the material by the customer 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of metals sold  direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits  repairs and maintenance  and freight 
general and administrative expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative costs  professional services  facility rentals and related insurance and utility costs  as well as costs related to the company s marketing and business development activities 
non recurring expenses include costs recognized during december that were principally non cash and which were incurred with respect to write offs of certain of its investments in emco recycling  severance benefits for a former officer  and the cost of certain compensatory warrants which were issued on december  other income and expense consists principally of interest income  gains or losses on the sale of fixed assets  and income and losses from joint ventures which represent an allocation of income and losses attributable to investments made by the company in two joint ventures 
both joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  consolidated net sales for the years ended march  and in broad product categories were as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal commodity weight net sales weight net sales ferrous metals tons     non ferrous metals pounds  in s     brokerage tons   other  consolidated net sales for the year ended march  were million compared with consolidated net sales of million for the year ended march  the significant increase in consolidated net sales is principally due to the inclusion of the net sales of the companies acquired by metal management during the year ended march  ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march   as compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the significant increase in ferrous sales  both in tons sold and as a percentage of total net sales  is due primarily to the inclusion of ferrous sales of houtex  reserve iron metal  the isaac group  proler southwest and cozzi iron metal  each of which is primarily engaged in the sale of ferrous metals 
non ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  as compared to of consolidated net sales in the comparable prior period 
the decrease in percentage of non ferrous sales is due to substantial amounts of ferrous sales resulting from the acquisitions of houtex  reserve iron metal  the isaac group  proler southwest and cozzi iron metal  which primarily sell ferrous metals 
the increase in pounds of non ferrous metals sold is due to the inclusion of non ferrous sales of macleod and aerospace  which are primarily engaged in the sale of non ferrous metals 
a portion of reserve iron metal  the isaac group and cozzi iron metal s businesses involve the brokering of scrap iron and other metals for sale to foundries  mills and other brokers 
brokered metals are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier  thereby  eliminating processing costs and inventory holding costs 
brokerage revenues are principally derived from ferrous metals 
for the year ended march   the company realized a gross profit margin on brokered sales 
gross profits on brokered sales will vary depending on the type of metals and markets in which metals are brokered 
consolidated gross profit was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with consolidated gross profit of million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the price of scrap metal is affected by regional and seasonal variations 
furthermore  prices for scrap metal are also impacted by broad and global cyclical movements and as such equilibrates supply and demand 
consolidated general and administrative expenses were million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects the inclusion of a full year of administrative expenses for those operations acquired during the year ended march  and the inclusion of a partial year of administrative expenses for the operations acquired by the company during the year ended march  corporate overhead has also increased due to additions in corporate staff and corporate expenses ie legal  audit  travel  etc 
to support the acquisition strategy the company is pursuing 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales reflects the large scale of operations at reserve iron metal  the isaac group and cozzi iron metal that provides for more efficient allocation of administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march   compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase is attributed to the inclusion of goodwill amortization and depreciation of fixed assets of those operations acquired by the company since the year ended march  during the year ended march   the company recorded the following non recurring pre tax charges  totaling million of consolidated net sales in thousands non cash warrant compensation expense  severance and other termination benefits  emco recycling shut down  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
interest expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march   versus million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  this increase is due to the issuance of notes to sellers and the incurrence and or assumption of debt associated with the completed acquisitions 
net loss from continuing operations  after preferred stock dividends and accretion  was million per share for the year ended march  compared to a net loss of million 
per share for the year ended march  the increase in the net loss is primarily attributable to the non recurring charges recorded by the company in the third quarter of the year ended march  net loss from continuing operations excluding the non recurring charges and the one time non cash dividend charge was million 
per share for the year ended march  compared to million 
per share for the year ended march  income from discontinued operations was million 
per share for the year ended march  compared to million 
per share for the comparable prior period 
income during the current fiscal year mainly reflects the royalty income recognized by the company from the sale of its discontinued operations  net of certain expenses paid 
prior year results reflect three months of operations of the discontinued operations as well as the gain on sale of the discontinued operations 
income tax benefit for the year ended march  was million of consolidated net sales  which yields an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the permanent differences represented by non deductible goodwill amortization and certain non deductible  non recurring expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company will continue to pursue acquisitions in the scrap metal recycling industry and anticipates financing these acquisitions through a combination of cash and the issuance of debt and equity 
the company will require substantial capital to fund future acquisitions and current operations 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
cash flows from continuing operations the company generated million of cash flows from continuing operations during the year ended march  compared with cash outflows of million during the year ended march  the increase mainly reflects cash flows generated from operations acquired during the year ended march  cash flows from investing activities the company made capital expenditures of approximately million during the year ended march   compared with capital expenditures of million during the year ended march  the company utilized cash of approximately million to complete the acquisitions of  and transaction costs related to  the operations acquired by the company during the year ended march  management anticipates continuing to make acquisitions  make capital expenditures for new equipment  and upgrade and expand existing equipment and facilities 
the company expects that these expenditures may increase in the future due to the internal and external growth of the company 
cash flows from financing activities during the year ended march   the company issued  shares of restricted common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in two private offerings which aggregated million and received proceeds from the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock which aggregated million collectively  the private placements 
the proceeds from the private placements were used to fund purchase consideration with respect to acquisitions  repay debt and provide working capital 
the company anticipates growing through acquisitions and will require additional debt or equity to fund its potential and future acquisitions 
cash flows from discontinued operations the company s cash flows from discontinued operations for the year ended march  reflects royalty income recognized from the sale of the assets of the discontinued operations  net of expenses paid 
cash flows during the year ended march  reflect the cash generated by the discontinued operations as well as the proceeds related to the sale of the discontinued operations 
financial condition the company s principal sources of cash are its existing cash and cash equivalents balances  collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from lines of credit and other borrowings 
at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at march  significant transactions during the year ended march   the company completed certain significant debt and equity transactions 
the company raised approximately million from the issuance of restricted common stock and raised approximately million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
the company utilized a portion of the cash to pay approximately million of notes which were issued in connection with certain acquisitions  to pay a million term loan and to fund million of the cash portion of the purchase price for certain acquisitions 
cash requirements for maturing debt obligations in connection with the acquisition of the isaac group  the company issued and assumed notes payable 
the notes require quarterly interest payments and require principal payments of million on february  and million on february  cash requirements for pending acquisitions the company expects that the cash component of purchase price for pending acquisitions  if all such acquisitions are completed  will be million 
working capital availability and requirements accounts receivable balances increased from million at march  to million at march   primarily as a result of the inclusion of the accounts receivable of the operations acquired by the company since march  accounts payable increased from million at march  to million at march   primarily as a result of such acquisitions 
inventory levels can vary significantly among the company s subsidiaries 
inventory on hand at march  and march   respectively  consisted of the following categories and amounts in thousands ferrous metals   non ferrous metals   other the increase in the value of inventory is primarily due to the inclusion of the inventories of reserve iron metal  the isaac group  aerospace and cozzi iron metal  all of which were acquired during the year ended march  the company expects to make substantial investments in additional equipment and property for expansion  for replacement of assets  and in connection with future acquisitions 
at march   the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings with commercial lenders under various short term revolving lines of credit in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the facilities provided for revolving credit at interest rates that range from to 
on march   the company and its subsidiaries entered into a credit facility the senior credit facility with bt commercial corporation  as agent for the lenders the agent  and certain commercial lending institutions providing for a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of million 
on june   the senior credit facility was amended to increase the facility to million 
the senior credit facility matures on march  the senior credit facility bears interest at a floating rate per annum equal to at the company s option i over libor or ii over bankers trust company s prime rate as in effect from time to time 
the senior credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the company and its subsidiaries are required under the senior credit facility to pay the agent and the lenders certain fees and expenses which include an unused line fee on a monthly basis 
the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries under the senior credit facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets and properties of the company and its subsidiaries 
availability of loans and letters of credit under the senior credit facility is generally limited to a borrowing base constituted of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and a million fixed asset sublimit that amortizes on a quarterly basis 
on april   the company made borrowings of million under the senior credit facility to i repay outstanding secured debt of approximately million  ii buyout operating leases of approximately million  and iii pay prepayment penalties of approximately million  leaving the company with approximately million available under the senior credit facility as of such date 
borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility as of april  bore interest at 
on may   the company sold  in a rule a private offering and pursuant to regulation s under the securities act of  as amended  million of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes mature on may  and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
the proceeds of the offering were used in part to repay indebtedness of the company  with the remainder used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under the company s working capital lines of credit at march  was 
average borrowings under the various working capital lines of credit during fiscal were approximately million 
during fiscal  amounts outstanding under the various working capital lines of credit ranged from million to million 
year liability the company is in the process of reviewing its existing computer software systems  and in connection with that process is analyzing whether or not the company faces a year problem  a problem that is expected to arise with respect to computer programs that use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  and which were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
although the company has not yet made a final determination as to whether the various computer systems at its operations will give rise to a year problem  the company believes that any such problem  if it arises in the future  should not be material to the company s operations 
investment considerations in the normal course of its business  the company  in an effort to help keep its stockholders and the public informed about the company s operations  may from time to time issue or make certain statements  either in writing or orally  that are or contain forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the us federal securities laws 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions made by or to be made by the company  projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings  profitability or other aspects of operating results or other future developments in the affairs of the company or the industry in which it conducts business 
the words expect  believe  anticipate  project  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company cautions readers that such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of factors that may tend to influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based  including but not limited to those discussed below 
all phases of the company s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks  and other influences  many of which are outside the control of the company  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the financial condition or results of operations of the company  the trading price of the company s common stock  and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
the following discussion outlines certain factors that could affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or future prospects and cause them to differ materially from those that may be set forth in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
leverage  ability to service indebtedness  capital requirements as reflected in the company s periodic reports filed from time to time under the securities exchange act of  as amended  the company is  and may continue to be  highly leveraged 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences to the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be required to be dedicated to debt service and will not be available to the company for its operations  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes could be limited  iii the company will have increased vulnerability to adverse general economic and scrap metals industry conditions  and iv the company may be vulnerable to higher interest rates because borrowings under certain of its credit arrangements are at variable rates of interest 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future working capital borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or make necessary capital expenditures 
implementing the company s acquisition strategy will require substantial amounts of capital 
the company will need large amounts of cash in order to fund the cash portion of current pending and future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds for these acquisitions will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to raise sufficient capital when required or needed could adversely affect the implementation of the company s acquisition strategy 
restrictions imposed by indebtedness the company s senior credit facility and the indenture governing the notes the indenture contain  and future financings of the company are likely to contain  covenants that  among other things and subject to certain exceptions  restrictions on ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  prepay subordinated indebtedness  dispose of certain assets  create liens and make certain investments or acquisitions  and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
in addition  under the senior credit facility  the company is required to satisfy specified financial covenants  including an interest coverage ratio and ratio of capital expenditures to consolidated revenues 
the ability of the company to comply with such provisions may be affected by general economic conditions and other events beyond the company s control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior credit facility 
in the event of any such default  depending on the actions taken by the lenders under the senior credit facility  such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
a default under the senior credit facility may cause a cross default under the indenture 
potential substantial dilution to existing stockholders  registration rights the company s amended certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of i  shares of common stock  of which  were issued and outstanding as of march   ii  shares of blank check preferred stock preferred stock  of which  have been designated as either series a or series b preferred stock as defined herein and  of which were outstanding as of march  the company s board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common or preferred shares  or securities convertible or exercisable into such shares such as options or warrants  as the case may be for a variety of purposes including as consideration for additional acquisitions 
these additional shares may be issued  or be subject to exercise  at prices below prevailing market prices of the common stock or at prices below the company s book value 
common stock sold at such a discount would result in dilution to the then existing stockholders of the company as well as reduce each stockholders percentage ownership interest in the company 
further  the company may issue additional shares of preferred stock on terms and conditions which may discourage  impede or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy contest even though such an event may be favorable to the interest of stockholders as a whole 
any registration statement filed by the company relating to the common stock will increase the number of shares available for sale in the public market and may have an adverse impact on the market price of the common stock 
potential inability to control or manage growth or to successfully integrate acquired businesses the company intends to continue to actively pursue mergers and acquisitions in the scrap metals recycling industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring other entities or that it will be able to effectively manage these acquired entities 
the company s ability to achieve its expansion objectives and to manage its growth effectively depends on a variety of factors  including the ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition  the integration of new businesses into the company s operations  the achievement of cost savings and the availability of capital 
the inability to control or manage growth effectively or to successfully integrate new businesses into the company s operations would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
depending on the nature and size of these transactions  if any  the company may experience working capital and liquidity shortages 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
limited operating history  history of operating losses the company has only recently entered the scrap metals recycling industry 
accordingly  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
due to the limited experience of management in effecting a consolidation strategy on the scale being pursued by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully effect its consolidation strategy  even if the company is able to acquire other entities on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  none of the company s existing subsidiaries has  and only a limited number of the company s future acquisitions likely will have  experience operating as a subsidiary of a public holding company subject to formal accounting and reporting requirements 
the company will be required to continue to devote significant management time and capital to enhance information systems and to improve and monitor internal controls  as well as to recruit managers with appropriate skills to insure the timeliness and accuracy of financial reports 
the success of the consolidation strategy depends in part on the ability of the company s management to oversee diverse operations and to successfully integrate processing  marketing and other resources 
in addition  the company s metal management arizona subsidiary has incurred operating losses and required capital infusions since its acquisition in april there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to provide additional funding to metal management arizona 
further  there can be no assurance that existing or future subsidiaries will not require similar infusions or that the company will be able to provide such fundings if needed 
the need to provide this funding or its inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
cyclicality of the metals recycling industry the operating results of the scrap metals recycling industry in general  and the company s operations specifically  are highly cyclical in nature as they tend to reflect and be amplified by general economic conditions 
historically  in periods of national recession or periods of minimal economic growth  the operations of scrap metals recycling companies have been materially and adversely affected 
for example  during recessions or periods of minimal economic growth  the automobile and the construction industries typically experience major cutbacks in production  resulting in decreased demand for steel  copper and aluminum and significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for the company s products 
future economic downturns in the national economy would likely materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the ability of the company to withstand significant economic downturns in the future will depend in part on the level of the company s capital and liquidity 
potential inability to complete pending acquisitions the company engages in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of companies or businesses in the metals recycling industry 
if the parties are able to agree generally on the nature  terms and conditions of a transaction  a letter of intent is typically prepared to reflect this understanding 
in many cases  these letters of intent are structured as binding letters of intent to purchase the business  although each such letter of intent is still generally subject to a number of terms and conditions  including but not limited to negotiation and execution of definitive purchase agreements 
in addition  each potential acquisition may be subject to additional contingencies specific to that acquisition 
there can be no assurance that any such potential acquisition will result in the execution of a definitive agreement or that such acquisition will be completed on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
commodity price risk although the company has a policy of turning over its inventory of raw or processed scrap metals as rapidly as possible  the company is exposed to commodity price risk during the period that it has title to products that are held in inventory for processing and or resale 
prices of commodities can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  labor costs  competition  availability of scrap metal substitutes  import duties  tariffs and currency exchange rates 
in an increasing price environment  competitive conditions may limit the company s ability to pass on price increases to its customers 
in a decreasing price environment  the company may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw scrap it processes and sells to its customers 
the lack of long term purchase agreements with the company s significant customers also may exacerbate this risk 
comprehensive regulatory requirements the company is subject to significant government regulation  including stringent environmental laws and regulations 
among other things  these laws and regulations impose comprehensive local  state  federal  foreign and supranational statutory and regulatory requirements concerning  among other matters  the treatment  acceptance  identification  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of industrial by products  hazardous and solid waste materials  waste water  stormwater effluent  air emissions  soil contamination  surface and groundwater pollution  employee health and safety  operating permit standards  monitoring and spill containment requirements  zoning  and land use  among others 
various laws and regulations set prohibitions or limits on the release of contaminants into the environment 
such laws and regulations also require permits to be obtained and manifests to be completed and delivered in connection with any shipment of prescribed materials so that the movement and disposal of such material can be traced and the persons responsible for any mishandling of such material can be identified 
this regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens  costs and risks on the company 
violation of such laws and regulations may give rise to significant liability to the company  including fines  damages  fees and expenses 
releases of certain industrial by products and waste materials are subject to particular laws and regulations 
although the specific provisions of laws and regulations related to such releases vary among jurisdictions  such laws and regulations typically require that the relevant authorities be notified promptly  that the release be cleaned up promptly  and that remedial action be taken by the responsible party and or owner of the site to restore the environment to levels protective of human health and the environment 
generally  the governmental authorities are empowered to act to clean up and remediate releases and environmental damage and to charge the costs of such cleanup to one or more of the owners of the property  the person responsible for the spill  the generator of the contaminant and certain other parties or to direct the responsible party to take such action 
these authorities may also impose a tax or other liens to secure such parties reimbursement obligations 
environmental laws and regulations impose strict operational requirements on the performance of certain aspects of hazardous or toxic substance remediation 
these requirements specify complex methods for identification  monitoring  storage  treatment and disposal of waste materials managed during a project 
failure to meet these requirements could result in substantial fines and other penalties 
environmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and it is likely that the company will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future 
for example  the ultimate effect of the regulations to be implemented under the clean air act amendments of the clean air act  and the actual amount of any capital expenditures required thereby  will depend on how the clean air act is interpreted and implemented pursuant to regulations that are currently being developed and on additional factors such as the evolution of environmental control technologies and the economic viability of these technologies 
for these reasons  future capital expenditures for environmental control facilities cannot be predicted with accuracy  however  one may expect that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and that the expenditures necessary to comply with them could increase substantially 
local  state  federal  foreign and supranational governments and agencies have also from time to time proposed or adopted other types of laws  regulations or initiatives with respect to the scrap metals recycling industry  including laws  regulations and initiatives intended to ban or restrict the intrastate  interstate or international shipment of wastes  to impose higher taxes or fees on certain shipments of waste  or to classify or reclassify certain categories of non hazardous wastes as hazardous 
certain local  state  federal  foreign and international governments and agencies have promulgated flow control or other regulations  which attempt to require that all waste or certain types of waste generated within the jurisdiction in question must go to certain disposal sites 
due to the complexity of regulation of the industry and to public and political pressure  implementation of existing or future laws  regulations or initiatives by different levels of governments may be inconsistent and difficult to foresee 
the company requires  and must comply with  various permits and licenses to conduct its operations 
government agencies continually monitor compliance with permits and licenses and the company s facilities are subject to periodic unannounced inspection by local  state and federal authorities 
violations of any permit or license  if not remedied  could result in the company incurring substantial fines  suspension of operations or closure of a site 
governmental authorities have a wide variety of powerful administrative enforcement actions and remedial orders available to them to cause compliance with environmental laws or to remedy or punish violations of such laws 
such orders may be directed to various parties  including present or former owners or operators of the concerned sites  or parties that have or had control over the sites 
in certain instances  fines and treble damages may be imposed 
in the event that administrative actions fail to cure a perceived problem or where the relevant regulatory agency so desires  an injunction or temporary restraining order or damages may be sought in a court proceeding 
some laws also give private parties the right  in addition to existing common laws claims  to file claims for injunctive relief or damages against the owners or operators of the site 
public interest groups  local citizens  local municipalities and other persons or organizations may have a right to seek judicial relief for purported violations of law or releases of pollutants into the environment 
in some jurisdictions  recourse to the courts by individuals under common law principles such as trespass or nuisance have been or may be enhanced by legislation providing members of the public with statutory rights of action to protect the environment 
in such cases  even if a scrap metals recycling facility is operated in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations  local citizens and other persons and organizations may seek compensation for damages allegedly caused by the operation of the facility 
in some cases  the operation of scrap metals recycling facilities is subjected to heightened public scrutiny because of residential or other non industrial property uses that have developed around such facilities 
so called not in my backyard nimby grass roots community opposition to such facilities can materially interfere with such facilities on going operations and growth 
the company believes that  with heightened legal  political and citizen awareness and concerns  all companies in the scrap metals recycling industry may be faced  in the normal course of operating their businesses  with fines and penalties and the need to expend substantial funds for capital projects  remedial work and operating activities  such as environmental contamination monitoring  soil removal  groundwater treatment  creation of engineered barriers  establishing institutional controls and related activities 
regulatory or technological developments relating to the environment may require companies engaged in the scrap metals recycling industry to modify  supplement or replace equipment and facilities at costs which may be substantial 
because the scrap metals recycling industry has the potential for discharge of materials into the environment  a material portion of the capital expenditures by the company is expected to relate  directly or indirectly  to such equipment and facilities 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental laws and regulations  and enforcement policies will require even more significant capital investments in this regard 
potential environmental liability general 
the company is subject to potential liability and may also be required from time to time to clean up or take certain remedial action with regard to sites currently or formerly used in connection with its operations 
furthermore  the company may be required to pay for all or a portion of the costs to clean up or remediate sites the company never owned or on which it never operated if it is found to have arranged for transportation  treatment or disposal of pollutants or hazardous or toxic substances on or to such sites 
the company also is subject to potential liability for environmental damage that its assets or operations may cause nearby landowners  particularly as a result of any contamination of drinking water sources or soil  including damage resulting from conditions existing prior to the acquisition of such assets or operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company  and could materially adversely affect the marketability and price of the company s stock 
incompleteness of site investigations 
as part of its pre transaction due diligence investigations  the company typically hires an environmental consulting firm to conduct transaction screen reviews  or phase i and or phase ii site assessments of the sites owned or leased by particular acquisition or merger candidates the pre transaction site assessments 
however  such pre transaction site assessments have not covered and will not in the future cover all of the sites owned or leased by the companies which are acquired by or merge with the company 
moreover  such pre transaction site assessments which have occurred have not been designed or expected and will not in the future be designed or expected to disclose all material contamination or liability that may be present 
for example  the company does not include soil sampling or core borings as a standard part of the phase i portion of its pre transaction site assessments  even though such sampling and core borings might increase the chances of finding contamination on a particular site 
failure to conduct soil sampling and core borings on a particular site could result in the company failing to identify a seriously contaminated site prior to an acquisition or merger  and could materially adversely affect the company 
likelihood of contamination at some sites 
pre transaction site assessments of the company s current sites conducted by independent environmental consulting firms have revealed that some soil  surface water and or groundwater contamination is likely at certain of these sites  and have recommended that certain additional investigations and remediation be conducted 
based upon its review of these reports  the company believes that it is likely that contamination exists at certain of its sites and that it is likely that additional investigation  monitoring and remediation will be required at some of the sites 
also based upon its review of these reports  the company believes that such contamination is likely to include  but not be limited to polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  total petroleum hydrocarbons  volatile organic compounds vocs  antimony  arsenic  cadmium  copper  lead  mercury  silver  zinc  waste oil  toluene  meta and para xylenes  baghouse dust  and or aluminum dross 
the ultimate extent of such contamination cannot be stated with any certainty at this point  and there can be no assurance that the cost of remediation will be immaterial  and it is not unlikely that the company will establish one or more reserves relating to environmental remediation in the future 
the existence of such contamination could result in federal  state  local or private enforcement or cost recovery actions against the company  possibly resulting in disruption of company operations  the need for proactive remedial measures  and substantial fines  penalties  damages  costs and expenses being imposed against the company 
the company expects to require future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of environmental liabilities 
the incurrence of the costs may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of aerospace metals  inc aerospace  the company has identified certain on site contamination which will require remediation in accordance with a remediation plan prepared by an independent engineering firm 
the costs of such remediation will be paid by the seller of the assets of aerospace from an escrow fund established for such purpose out of the purchase consideration paid by the company for such assets 
uncertain costs of environmental compliance and remediation 
many factors affect the level of expenditures the company will be required to make in the future to comply with environmental requirements  including i new local  state and federal laws and regulations  ii the developing nature of administrative standards promulgated under superfund and other environmental laws  and changing interpretations of such laws  iii uncertainty regarding adequate control levels  testing and sampling procedures  new pollution control technology and cost benefit analyses based on market conditions  iv the incompleteness of information regarding the condition of certain sites  v the lack of standards and information for use in the apportionment of remedial responsibilities  vi the numerous choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in remedial actions at such sites  vii the possible ability to recover indemnification or contribution from third parties  and viii the time periods over which eventual remediation may occur 
therefore  the estimated costs  and the timing of such costs  for future environmental compliance capital expenditures or increases in operating costs or other expenditures and remediation cannot be accurately predicted and are necessarily imprecise  however  such costs could be material to future quarterly or annual results of operations of the company 
in addition  it is not possible to predict whether or not such costs can be passed on to customers through price increases 
lack of environmental impairment insurance 
in general  the company s subsidiaries do not carry environmental impairment liability insurance 
in general  the company s subsidiaries operate under general liability insurance policies  which do not cover environmental damage 
if one or more of the company s subsidiaries were to incur significant liability for environmental damage not covered by environmental impairment insurance  or for other claims in excess of its general liability insurance and umbrella coverage  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with certain by products 
although the majority of the company s metal products are currently exempt from applicable solid waste regulations  the company s scrap metals recycling operations produce significant amounts of by products 
heightened environmental risk is associated with certain of these by products 
for example  certain of the company s subsidiaries operate shredders for which the primary feed materials are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances 
approximately of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of material shredder fluff which remains after the segregation of ferrous and saleable non ferrous metals 
federal environmental regulations require shredder fluff to pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste 
the company endeavors to have hazardous contaminants from the feed material removed prior to shredding and  as a result  the company believes the shredder fluff generated is properly not considered a hazardous waste 
should the laws  regulations or testing methods change with regard to shredder fluff disposal  the company may incur additional significant expenditures 
potential superfund liability 
a the company s reserve iron metal  cozzi iron metal and kankakee scrap subsidiaries have received notices from the epa that each such company and numerous other parties are considered prps and may be obligated under superfund to pay a portion of the cost of remedial investigation  feasibility studies and  ultimately  remediation to correct alleged releases of hazardous substances at the standard scrap metal chicago international exporting removal action site 
superfund may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that arranged for disposal of certain wastes  the waste transporters that selected the disposal sites  and the owners and operators of such sites 
responsible parties or any one of them may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  legality of the original disposal  or ownership of the disposal site 
based upon their analysis of the situation  the management of reserve iron metal  cozzi iron metal and kankakee scrap currently do not expect their aggregate potential liability to be in excess of  there can be no assurance  however  that their aggregate potential liability may not be greater than  b cozzi iron metal has received a notice from the epa that cozzi iron metal is a prp under superfund in regard to the site referred to as h h recycling in gary  indiana

bluestone has entered into a settlement agreement with the epa regarding the cleanup of this site and has paid its initial settlement share under the settlement agreement 
however  the aggregate costs of cleaning up this site are likely to exceed the original estimate of the aggregate cleanup costs upon which the initial settlement amount paid by bluestone was based 
based on its current analysis of the situation  bluestone expects that its share of the additional cleanup costs at this site will not exceed  although bluestone has reserved funds to address additional cleanup costs and has obtained an indemnity from the previous owners of the company for costs which exceed this reserve  there can be no assurance that bluestone may not be required to make additional expenditures in connection with this site

no assurance can be given that potential liabilities of the company in regard to such deaths and injuries  or in regard to any future deaths of or injuries to the company s employees  will not be material 
labor relations many of the company s active employees are represented by various labor unions  including the teamsters union  the united steel workers union and the united auto workers

cozzi the cozzi shareholders  t 
benjamin jennings and gerard m 
jacobs the mtlm shareholders  samstock  llc samstock and the company  the company s board of directors is comprised of five directors nominated by the cozzi shareholders  five directors nominated by the mtlm shareholders  and one director nominated by samstock 
further  the cozzi shareholders  the mtlm shareholders and samstock as of march  owned approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result of their shareholdings  the cozzi shareholders  the mtlm shareholders and samstock may be deemed to have effective control over the affairs and management of the company 
there can be no assurance that this influence will be used in a manner that is consistent with the interests of the other holders of the company s securities 
the parties to the stockholders agreement also have agreed to vote for proposals  if and when presented by the company  to amend the company s organizational documents to require the approval of at least two thirds of the board of directors to take certain actions 
if the company s organizational documents are amended to reflect these restrictions  and the board of directors cannot agree on the company s strategic direction  a minority of four dissenting directors could prevent the company from taking certain actions 
should the board of directors be unable to act because a minority of dissenting directors prevents it from taking a significant action  this impasse could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
certain decisions concerning the operations or financial structure of the company may present conflicts of interest between the company s shareholders and its creditors 
for example  if the company encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts as they become due  the interests of the company s shareholders might conflict with those of its creditors 
the company s shareholders also may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions  divestitures  financings or other transactions that could enhance their equity investment  even though such transactions might involve risk to the company s creditors 
because the members of the company s senior management team are significant shareholders of the company  any such conflict of interest may be resolved in favor of the company s shareholders to the detriment of the company s creditors 
dependence on key personnel the company s operations to date have depended in large part on the skills and efforts of its senior management team  including t 
benjamin jennings  its chairman and chief development officer  gerard m 
jacobs  its chief executive officer  and albert a 
cozzi  its president and chief operating officer 
in addition  because the company s senior management team other than mr 
cozzi has limited experience in the scrap metals recycling business  the company relies substantially on the experience of the management of its subsidiaries with regard to day to day operations 
while the company has employment agreements with messrs 
jennings  jacobs and cozzi and certain members of its management team at the subsidiary level  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of any of the foregoing 
the loss of any member of its senior management team or a significant number of managers could have a material adverse effect on the company s efforts to manage and integrate acquisitions and may also adversely impact the company s ability to implement its consolidation strategy 
dependence on scrap suppliers the profitability of the company s scrap recycling operations depends  in part  on the availability of an adequate source of supply 
the company acquires its scrap inventory from numerous sources 
these suppliers generally are not bound by long term contracts and have no obligation to continue selling scrap materials to the company 
if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling scrap metals to the company  the company s results of operations or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
concentration of customers and credit risk the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  accounts receivable balances from these customers represented approximately of consolidated accounts receivable at march  the loss of any one of the company s significant customers could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in connection with the sale of the company s products  the company generally does not require collateral as security for customer receivables 
certain of the company s subsidiaries have significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions that may impair the collectibility of these receivables 
failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on these receivables could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
competition the metals recycling industry is highly competitive and subject to significant changes in overall market conditions 
certain of the company s competitors may have greater financial  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain its desired market share or compete effectively in its markets 
use of scrap alternatives the increased demand for scrap metals by the expanding mini mill industry has caused a tightness in the supply and demand balance for ferrous scrap 
the relative scarcity of ferrous scrap  particularly the cleaner grades  and its high price have created opportunities for producers of alternatives to scrap metals 
although these alternatives have not been a major factor in the industry to date  there can be no assurance that the use of alternatives to scrap metals will not proliferate if the prices for scrap metals continue to rise and if the levels of available unprepared ferrous scrap continue to decrease 
any significant increase in the use of scrap metals alternatives by current consumers of processed scrap metals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
potential restrictions on mergers and other actions section of the delaware general corporation law the delaware business combination statute prohibits  under certain circumstances  business combinations between a delaware corporation whose stock is publicly traded and an interested stockholder of such corporation 
the provisions prohibiting business combinations could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or a change in control of the company 
the provisions could also discourage  impede  or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if such an event would be favorable to the interest of stockholders 
in addition  the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of undesignated preferred stock  which the board of directors may cause the company to issue in one or more series 
the board of directors has designated  and  shares  respectively  of the preferred stock for issuance as series a convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock 
the board of directors has the authority to fix the number of shares of preferred stock and determine or alter for each series  the voting powers  designations  preferences and rights of such shares 
if the company should ever issue preferred stock in addition to the convertible preferred stock  such preferred stock could contain voting or other rights which could discourage  impede  or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy contest which could be favorable to the interests of the stockholders 
so long as shares of series a or series b preferred stock are outstanding  the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the holders of at least a majority of all shares of the applicable series of preferred stock outstanding at the time before i increasing the authorized number of shares of such series of preferred stock  ii altering or changing the rights  preferences or privileges of such series of preferred stock or any other capital stock of the company so as to adversely affect such series of preferred stock  or iii creating any new class or series of capital stock having a preference over such series of preferred stock as to distribution of assets upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
this restriction could prevent the company from taking actions which could be favorable to the interests of the stockholders 
volatility of trading price the trading price of the common stock has been  and in the future is expected to be  volatile and subject to market fluctuation as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  merger and acquisition announcements and developments  current and anticipated results of operations  execution of private or public equity or debt placements  filing and effectiveness of registration statements relating to the common stock  future product offerings by the company or its competitors and factors unrelated to the operating performance of the company 
the trading price of the common stock may also vary as a result of changes in the business  operations  prospects or financial results of the company  general market and economic conditions  additional future proposed acquisitions by the company and other factors 
failure in any fiscal quarter to meet the investment community s revenues or earnings expectations  if any  could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common stock  as could sales of large amounts of common stock by existing stockholders 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
in the event the market price of common stock were adversely affected by such sales  the company s access to equity capital markets could be adversely affected and issuances of common stock in connection with acquisitions  or otherwise  could dilute future earnings per share 
management believes that the company s stock price reflects an assumption that its existing pending acquisitions will be completed 
if these acquisitions are not completed  the trading price of the common stock could be adversely affected
