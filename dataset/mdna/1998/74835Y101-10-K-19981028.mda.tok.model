during the prior fiscal year  the gross profit of  on sales of glofil and inulin and other income of  principally interest income was offset by  in expenses for sales and marketing  general and administrative  clinical testing and regulatory  and pre clinical research and development as well as depreciation and amortization 
during the third quarter  the company announced that its largest glofil customer had informed the company that it would be terminating two clinical trials which require glofil to be used as part of their protocols 
those trials have terminated and as stated previously in the third quarter  the company expects the loss of sales to this customer to slow the rate of overall sales growth for the next six to nine months 
sales and marketing expense increased by to  from  in the prior year  principally as a result of additional promotional costs for glofil and increased payroll expense from pay raises and the hiring of additional personnel 
general and administrative expense increased by to  from  in the prior year 
approximately of the increase was due to the expenditures related to acquiring the dermaflo technology and scaling up the manufacturing of the dermaflo products 
sometime during the fiscal year ending july   the company expects to have at least one dermaflo product available for sale at which point most of the ongoing dermaflo expense will be accounted for as cost of sales and the company s gross profit margin on both an absolute and percentage basis will suffer until sales of the dermaflo products reach a certain level 
the remainder of the increase reflected increased legal fees 
clinical testing and regulatory expense increased by to  from  in the prior year  principally as the result of increased staffing in the quality assurance quality control department  increased use of data input and management  statistical and other consultants to accelerate  finish and report on the company s various clinical trials and certain toxicology studies performed during the period 
pre clinical research and development expense decreased by to  from  in the prior year  principally due to a decrease in staffing and the completion of certain contract studies 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by to  from  in the prior year  principally as a result of the acquisition of ethamolin during the prior year and the related amortization of that purchased technology 
sublease income increased to  in the current year due to the sublease of the company s former corporate headquarters 
interest and other income increased by to  from  in the prior year  principally due to the additional interest earned on the proceeds from the exercise of the company s redeemable class b warrants in november research and grant income increased to  from  in the prior year  principally due to the receipt of two additional small business innovation research grants during the current year versus the receipt of one in the prior year 
the amortization of discount and costs on the notes decreased to  from  in the prior year 
the majority of the principal amount of the notes was converted in the prior year  and thus  a larger amount of amortization expense occurred 
the remaining principal balance of the notes was converted in the current year 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  during the fiscal year ended july   the company sustained a loss of  or

during the fiscal year  the gross profit of  on sales of glofil and inulin and other income of  principally interest income was offset by  in expenses for sales and marketing  general and administrative  clinical testing and regulatory  pre clinical research and development and depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization expense increased to  from  in the prior year  principally as a result of the acquisition of ethamolin during the fiscal year and the related amortization of that purchased technology 
during the fiscal year  the company recognized  of expense related to the amortization of i the discount on the notes and ii the deferred financing costs related to the private placements of the notes 
this resulted from the re classification of the notes from equity to debt resulting from a review of the company s various filings under the securities exchange act of by the securities and exchange commission triggered by the filing of a registration statement during the year pertaining to the resale of the common stock underlying some of the notes 
liquidity and capital resources the company has principally funded its activities to date through various issuances of equity securities  which have raised total net proceeds of million  as well as product sales 
at july   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  compared to  at july  at july   working capital was  compared to  at july  the increase in both balance sheet items was principally due to the receipt of net proceeds of  from the exercise of  the company s redeemable class b warrants prior to their expiration in november  offsetting the company s cash spent on operations for the year 
the company expects that its cash needs will increase significantly in future periods due to expansion of its research and development programs  increased clinical testing activity  growth of administrative  clinical and laboratory staff and their related equipment and space needs 
management believes that the company s working capital will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company for approximately months dependent  in part  on the timing of the commencement of each phase of the clinical trials on cordox and ceresine and the funding priorities that it gives its various research programs  the results of clinical tests and research programs  competing technological and market developments  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and in obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patents  the cost of product acquisitions and their resulting cash flows and other factors 
the company expects to seek additional funds through exercises of its currently outstanding options  public or private equity financings  collaborations or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
the company may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
impact of the year issue the year problem is the result of computer applications being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer applications and computer applications used by any of the company s customers  collaborators and manufacturers that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations 
the company has modified or replaced portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the costs associated with such modifications were not materially significant 
the company believes that  with these modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  because of the many uncertainties associated with year compliance issues  and because the company s assessment is necessarily based on information from third party customers  collaborators and manufacturers  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment is correct or as to the materiality or effect of any failure of such assessment to be correct 
the company has initiated a program to determne whether the computer applications of its significant customers  collaborators and manufacturers will be upgraded in a timely manner 
the company has not completed its review and it is unknown whether the computer applications of its customers  collaborators and manufacturers will be year compliant 
the company has not determined the extent to which any disruption in the computer applications of third parties caused by the year issues will affect the company s operations 
however  any disruptions in payments by customers or in the manufacture of the company s products could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company invests its excess cash in interest bearing investment grade securities 
the company holds all such securities for the remaining term of the security 
therefore  the company believes that it is not subject to material interest rate risks on such investments  other than the creditworthiness of the issuer of such securities 
in addition  the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion and does not believe it maintains any material exposure to such market risk sensitivities
