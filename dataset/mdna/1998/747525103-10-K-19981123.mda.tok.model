item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not specifically limited to the ability to develop and introduce cost effective new products in a timely manner  avoiding delays in the commercial implementation of the cdma technology  continued growth in the cdma subscriber population and the scale up and operations of cdma systems  developments in current or future litigation  the company s ability to effectively manage growth and the intense competition in the wireless communications industry  risks associated with vendor financing  timing and receipt of license fees and royalties  the company s ability to successfully manufacture and sell significant quantities of cdma infrastructure equipment on a timely basis  failure to satisfy performance obligations  as well as the other risks detailed in this section and in the sections entitled results of operations and liquidity and capital resources overview qualcomm is a leading provider of digital wireless communications products  technologies and services 
the company generates revenues primarily from license fees and royalties paid by licensees of the company s cdma technology  sales of cdma subscriber  infrastructure and asics products to domestic and international wireless communications equipment suppliers and service providers  sales of omnitracs terminals and related software and services to omnitracs users  and contract development services  including the design and development of subscriber and ground communications products for the globalstar system 
in addition  the company generates revenues from the design  development  manufacture and sale of a variety of other communications products and services 
the company generates revenue from its cdma licensees in the form of up front license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by such licensees of cdma subscriber and infrastructure products 
license fees are generally nonrefundable and may be paid in one or more installments 
revenues generated from license fees and royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations 
this is due to variations in the amount and timing of recognition of cdma license fees  pricing and amount of sales by the company s licensees and the company s ability to estimate such sales  and the impact of currency fluctuations and risks associated with royalties generated from international licensees 
the company manufactures cdma infrastructure products for sale to wireless network operators worldwide 
the company has entered into agreements regarding the manufacture and supply of cdma infrastructure products with hitachi  hughes and nortel 
the company manufactures its cdma subscriber products primarily through qpe  a joint venture between the company and a subsidiary of sony electronics  inc the company  through qpe  is one of the largest manufacturers of cdma handsets and has shipped over seven million handsets to customers around the world 
the company has also generated substantial revenue from the design and sale of cdma asics to its licensees for incorporation into their subscriber and infrastructure products 
as of september  the company has shipped approximately million msm asics to cdma handset manufacturers worldwide  including qpe 
the company generates revenues from its domestic omnitracs business by manufacturing and selling omnitracs terminals and related application software packages and by providing ongoing messaging and maintenance services to domestic omnitracs users 
the company generates revenues from its international omnitracs business through license fees  sales of network products and terminals  and service fees 
international messaging services are provided by service providers that operate network management centers for a region under licenses granted by the company 
the company has entered into a number of development and manufacturing contracts involving the globalstar system 
the company s development agreement provides for the design and development of the ground communication stations and user terminals of the globalstar system 
under the agreement  the company is reimbursed for its development services on a cost plus basis 
in addition  in april the company was awarded a contract to manufacture and supply commercial gateways for deployment in the globalstar system 
in march the company entered into an agreement with globalstar to manufacture and supply portable and fixed cdma handsets that will operate on the globalstar system 
revenues from international customers accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for fiscal  and respectively 
sales of subscriber  infrastructure and asics products internationally are subject to a number of risks 
wireless and satellite network operators  both domestic and international  increasingly have required their suppliers to arrange or provide long term financing for them as a condition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure projects 
in order to provide for such financing  the company likely will be subjected to vendor financing and currency fluctuation risks 
see risk factors risks relating to the company international business  currency fluctuations and vendor financing 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  increased operating expenses in absolute dollars 
the company continues to emphasize control of operating expenses and reduction of these expenses as a percentage of revenue 
the company is exposed to risk from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates  which could impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
qualcomm s financing on products and services is denominated in dollars and any significant change in the value of the dollar against the national currency where qualcomm is lending could result in the increase of costs to the debtors and could restrict the debtors from fulfilling their contractual obligations 
any devaluation in the local currency relative to the currencies in which such liabilities are payable could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in some developing countries  including chile  mexico  brazil  russia  and ukraine significant currency devaluation relative to the us dollar have occurred and may occur again in the future 
in such circumstances  the company may experience economic loss with respect to the collectability of its receivables and the recoverability of inventories as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time the company evaluates various strategic alternatives with regard to its businesses and operating divisions with the goal of maximizing long term stockholder value

as part of the company s strategy of supporting the commercialization and sale of its cdma technology and products  the company may from time to time enter into strategic alliances with domestic and international emerging wireless telecommunications operating companies 
these alliances often involve the investment by qualcomm of substantial equity in the operating company  as well as a commitment by the operating company to purchase cdma products from qualcomm 
at september   the company has investments in shinsegi telecomm inc korea and telesystems of ukraine 
qualcomm has also made a substantial funding commitment to leap wireless in the form of a million secured credit facility 
the credit facility consists of two sub facilities 
the first sub facility enables leap wireless to borrow up to million from qualcomm  subject to the terms thereof  solely to meet the normal working capital and operating expenses of leap wireless  including salaries  overhead and credit facility fees  but excluding  among other things  strategic capital investments in wireless operators  substantial acquisitions of capital products  and or the acquisition of telecommunications licenses

year readiness disclosure the year yk issue relates to the way computer systems and programs define calendar dates 
a system could fail or make miscalculations due to the interpretation of a date including to mean and not also  other systems and products that are not typically recognized as computer or information technology related may contain embedded hardware or software that would be affected by this issue 
the company has developed a plan tied to specific completion dates 
as of september   the company s yk project project  designed to minimize the impact of such computer problems on the results of operations  is proceeding on schedule 
however  the company is unable to completely determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
this is due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problems  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of third party suppliers  customers and utility services 
during fiscal  the company initiated a strategy to begin work on the correction of yk problems 
as part of this strategy  a yk program office was formed consisting of a program director  key individuals in the business units  analysts and administrative support 
the program office is directly focusing attention and required resources on the company s yk issues 
the company has also engaged an outside consulting firm to assist with project management  conversion and testing of yk issues 
all yk efforts are being coordinated through the program office to ensure consistency of approach and the ultimate readiness of qualcomm 
this strategy is expected to reduce our level of uncertainty about the yk problem and in particular  about the yk compliance and readiness of the company s material customers and suppliers 
we believe that with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced 
the yk company s program office is addressing the issues under four major sections internal readiness  supply chain assessment  product compliance and customer compliance 
each section is evaluated through four phases discovery  assessment  remediation and post remediation 
discovery is the process of inventorying potential yk issues throughout the company s business process 
assessment is the process of categorizing issues that were identified in the discovery phase into ready  not ready or needs more study 
remediation is the process of fixing and testing those items that must be ready for the yk 
post remediation is the process of addressing yk issues that were not previously or not adequately corrected 
internal readiness includes the computing and communications infrastructure  the tools and systems used to develop products and run the business  and internal service organizations 
the company has identified a majority of the systems that require remediation or replacement and these remediation efforts have begun 
those systems considered most critical to continuing operations are given the highest priority  and all testing is scheduled to be complete by june non compliant systems are scheduled to be retired  replaced  or repaired by september supply chain assessment involves evaluating the yk readiness of qualcomm s suppliers and their ability to continue delivering materials and services after the company has initiated formal communications with significant suppliers to determine the company s vulnerability to suppliers yk issues 
the company is requesting that third party vendors represent their products and services to be yk compliant and that they have a program to test for that compliance 
on site visits of key suppliers will be conducted for yk compliance 
the company expects to identify all critical suppliers state of readiness for yk compliance by december at this date  if the company determines a critical supplier will not be yk compliant by june  the company will continue to work with the supplier to assist them in achieving compliance  while in parallel initiating a search for an alternate yk compliant supplier to avoid supply chain interruptions 
product compliance includes the review of qualcomm s products for yk compliance 
the company s program office has been working with individual business unit managers to review all qualcomm products for yk compliance 
the company believes that the majority of its products are compliant with further formal verification being initiated where required 
all testing for yk product compliance is scheduled for completion by june the company estimates all products will be yk compliant by september the company is scheduled to issue a definitive statement of yk readiness for its products before july customer compliance reviews qualcomm s major customers for yk compliance 
the company s program office is in the preliminary stages of organizing this review 
the company does not currently have any information concerning the yk compliance status of the company s major customers 
the company will be requesting information from customers to understand their state of readiness for yk compliance 
we have scheduled this process to be complete by june while the company expects these efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruptions will not occur due to internal failure  the potential for interruption still exists 
the need for a contingency plan is recognized and plans will be developed to deal with such issues as at risk suppliers and interruption of utility and other services 
the response of certain third parties is beyond the control of the company 
if the company does not receive adequate yk compliant responses from its suppliers or customers prior to april  contingency plans will be developed and scheduled for no later than april contingency plans may include increasing inventory levels  securing alternate sources of supply  adjusting alternate shutdown and start up schedules  and other appropriate measures 
at this time  the company cannot estimate the additional cost  if any  that might develop from the implementation of such contingency plans 
the company believes its critical systems will be yk compliant by june however  there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved 
specific factors giving to this uncertainty include failure to identify all susceptible systems  non compliance by third parties whose systems and operations impact the company and other similar uncertainties 
a worst case scenario might include one or more of the company s internal systems  suppliers or customers being non compliant 
an event such as this could result in a material disruption to the company s operations 
specifically  the company could experience software application  computer network  manufacturing products and telephone system failures 
supply chain and product non compliance could result in the failure of the company to perform on contracts  delayed delivery of products to customers and inadequate customer service 
customer non compliance could result in delayed payments for products and services and build up of inventories 
should a worst case scenario occur  it could  depending on its duration  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
to become yk compliant  the company s total cost associated with required modifications is not expected to be material to our financial position 
to date the company has spent an estimated million on this project 
total budgeted cost at this time is estimated at million of which million represents the cost of staff and consultants to perform the project and million is the cost of software tools for discovery and testing as well as expenditures to replace older products that cannot be made yk compliant 
the sources of funding for this project are from fiscal operating and working capital budgets 
none of the company s other mission critical information projects have been delayed due to the implementation of the yk project 
future accounting requirements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  reporting comprehensive income  which the company will be required to adopt during the first quarter of fiscal year this statement will require the company to report in the financial statements  in addition to net income  comprehensive income and its components including  as applicable  foreign currency items  minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities 
upon adoption  the company will also be required to reclassify financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes 
the company currently expects that the effect of adoption of fas may be primarily from foreign currency translation adjustments and has not yet determined the manner in which comprehensive income will be displayed 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which the company will be required to adopt for fiscal year this statement establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
under fas  operating segments are to be determined consistent with the way that management organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
the company has not determined the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statement disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which the company will be required to adopt for fiscal year this statement establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk factors interest rate market risk 
the company has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term investments in marketable debt securities  and finance receivables 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information about investments in marketable debt securities and finance receivables  respectively 
the company s bank lines of credit are at variable interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about the bank lines of credit 
interest income earned on the company s short term investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  while interest income earned on long term investments are not affected in the near term 
the company believes that it is not exposed to significant changes in fair value because such investments are classified as held to maturity 
the fair value of each investment approximates its amortized cost  and long term securities have maturities of less than two years 
interest earned on certain finance receivables is at variable interest rates and is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the company s practice is to fund these receivables with variable interest rate debt to minimize the effects of interest rate changes 
interest expense is affected by the general level of us interest rates and or libor 
increases in interest expense resulting from an increase in interest rates would be offset by a corresponding increase in interest earned on the company s short term investments in debt securities 
distributions on trust convertible preferred securities are not affected by changes in interest rates because they accrue distributions at a fixed 
the company believes that it is not exposed to significant changes in fair value because of the fixed redemption price of the preferred securities 
the fixed and convertibility features are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the company s investment portfolio and bank lines of credit  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

the company has recorded derivative instruments in connection with the leap wireless spin off  including a an effective call option related to leap wireless obligation to issue approximately million shares of common stock to holders of qualcomm trust convertible preferred securities for no consideration  and b a warrant received by the company to purchase million shares of leap wireless common stock at per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies for these instruments 
see notes and for further information about the warrant and call option  respectively 
the recorded and fair values of these derivatives total million and million  respectively  at september  the estimated fair value of these derivatives would decrease by approximately as of year end if the price of the leap wireless stock were to decrease by 
this hypothetical decrease is suggestive of the effect on fair values  but not on future cash flows 
first  the issuance of leap wireless common stock to holders of qualcomm trust convertible preferred securities will not affect the cash flows of the company 
second  the company will pay a fixed price per share if its warrant to purchase leap wireless common stock is exercised 
these instruments are held for purposes other than trading  and the option is nontransferable 
the company s investments in other entities consist substantially of investments accounted for under the equity and cost methods which are predominantly closely held and not publicly traded 
accordingly  the company believes that its exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
foreign exchange market risk 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s currency translation and transaction accounting policies and information about the company s currency exposure management practices held for purposes other than trading 
foreign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations which may affect reported earnings include derivative financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  consisting primarily of forward contracts  and other financial instruments which are not denominated in the currency of the legal entity holding the instruments  consisting of accounts payable and receivable and long term financing obligations of an equity investee 
at september   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
accounts payable and receivable are reflected at fair value in the financial statements 
the company s interest in the fair value of the long term financing obligations of an equity investee would increase by million as of year end if the us dollar were to appreciate against the other currency by 
this hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on fair value  but not on future cash flows assuming that the equity investee will be able to meet its financing obligation
