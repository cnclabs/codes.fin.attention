risks and uncertainties statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not statements of historical fact may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including  without limitation  statements as to expectations  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
it is important to note that actual results could differ materially from such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including  among other things  the factors set forth below 
the forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is attributable to sales of components for building  maintaining and expanding the communications infrastructure 
these components are used primarily in cable  wireless and wired telephony systems in the united states and internationally 
the amount of capital spending in these industries is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  availability of financing  government regulation  demand for the products and services offered by the company s customers and technological developments 
a decrease in capital spending for communications infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the communications industry is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving product specifications 
additionally  price competition in this market is intense with significant price erosion over the life cycle of a product 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends on the continued introduction of new products and ongoing manufacturing cost reduction 
the company believes that it will continue to see varying degrees of price pressure across all product lines 
these price pressures  if not offset by cost reductions  could result in lower average gross margins 
certain of the company s business units sell products to a concentrated group of customers 
the loss of  or reduced demand for products from  any of the company s major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
such factors could adversely affect the company s international operations and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although the company s direct sales to customers in asia have historically been a small percentage of total sales  the company sells to customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
the company s subsidiaries currently buy a number of raw materials from single sources 
the failure of the subsidiaries to obtain sufficient raw materials or components as required  or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has completed an initial assessment of year issues at each of its operating units and has identified a number of potential problems and corrective actions required 
some of these actions have already been  and others remain to be  completed 
based on this initial assessment the company concluded that year issues at its facilities should not have a material impact on its financial or operating performance 
nonetheless  the company is retaining qualified independent consultants to review the company s assessment and the corrective action plans at the company s operating units 
pending completion of this additional review  and of all necessary corrective actions  it is not possible for the company to determine the extent of any difficulty it might experience at its facilities as a result of year issues 
such problems  or similar problems at the company s customers or suppliers  could temporarily affect the company s performance adversely 
the company s operations are subject to a variety of laws  regulations and licensing requirements  including governmental regulations relating to the environment 
in addition  various pending or threatened legal proceedings by or against the company or one or more of its subsidiaries involve alleged breaches of contract  torts and miscellaneous other causes of action 
the company does not currently believe that its compliance with applicable regulations or any litigation against the company will have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that future compliance efforts or litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
