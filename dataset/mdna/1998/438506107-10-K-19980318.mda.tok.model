risk management honeywell is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  honeywell enters into various hedging transactions through derivative financial instruments that have been authorized pursuant to its corporate policy 
honeywell policy prohibits the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  and honeywell is not a party to leveraged financial instruments 
foreign exchange honeywell primarily uses foreign exchange forwards and purchased options to hedge exposures to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates see notes and on pages and 
such exposures result from cross border transactions principally in belgian francs and deutsche marks 
foreign exchange contracts reduce honeywell s overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the underlying exposures 
transactions that are hedged include foreign currency net asset and net liability exposures on the balance sheet  firm purchase orders and firm sales commitments 
at year end  the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts was billion 
interest rates honeywell manages its exposure to interest rate movements and the cost of borrowing through the use of interest rate swaps by maintaining a proportionate relationship of fixed rate debt to total debt between a minimum and maximum percentage as set by corporate policy 
to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  honeywell enters into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principle amount see notes and on pages and 
at year end  the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps was billion 
value at risk to estimate the maximum potential loss that may arise from adverse market movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates  honeywell uses a value at risk statistical model 
the value at risk estimation utilizes weighted historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility of these rates in the future 
the calculated volatility is used to estimate the potential loss in the current value of the instruments at a specified probability level 
the value at risk methodology used by honeywell uses variance covariance statistical modeling and includes debt  interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges 
the estimated value at risk amounts represent the maximum potential loss that honeywell may incur from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates based on a five day time horizon and a percent confidence level on december  the value at risk for the combined portfolio was million at december   which includes the diversification benefit of analyzing the value at risk including the interest rates and foreign exchange on a combined basis as compared to individually  as changes in market conditions affect interest rates and foreign exchange differently 
the value at risk for the combined portfolio and the individual components are as follows value at risk in millions combined portfolio foreign exchange interest rates the value at risk amounts presented above do not consider the potential effect of favorable movements in market factors nor does the value at risk model include all of the underlying exposures that the hedges are designed to cover 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
since honeywell utilized foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for these instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transaction 
the quantitative information generated by the value at risk model is limited by the parameters built into the model 
consequently  honeywell relies on the experience and expertise of management s regular review of its financial instruments and the current market environment to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
year compliance computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  a result commonly referred to as the year problem 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations 
in  honeywell initiated a program to evaluate whether internally developed and purchased computer programs that utilize embedded date codes may experience operational problems when the year is reached 
the scope of this effort addressed internal computer systems  products sold and supplier capabilities 
honeywell is completing an extensive review of each of its businesses to determine whether or not purchased or internally developed computer programs are year compliant  as well as the remedial action and related costs associated with required modifications or replacements 
a significant amount of information has been collected and analyzed as part of this review  however  the process will not be completed until the end of the second quarter of honeywell plans to complete all remediation efforts for its critical systems prior to the year based on its evaluation to date  management currently believes that  while honeywell will incur internal and external costs to address the year problem  such costs will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of honeywell and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole  in future periods 
euro currency beginning in january  the european monetary union emu will enter into a three year transition phase during which a common currency called the euro will be introduced in participating countries 
initially  this new currency will be used for financial transactions  and progressively  it will replace the old national currencies that will be withdrawn by july the transition to the euro currency will involve changing budgetary  accounting and fiscal systems in companies and public administrations  as well as the simultaneous handling of parallel currencies and conversion of legacy data 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
additionally  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the european commission with regard to the euro currency 
honeywell has initiated a program to evaluate whether internally developed and purchased computer programs will experience operational problems when the euro is introduced 
further  honeywell is monitoring the rules and regulations as they become known in order to make any changes to its computer programs that honeywell deems necessary to comply with such rules and regulations 
although honeywell believes that it will be able to accommodate any required euro currency changes in its computer programs  there can be no assurance that once the final rules and regulations are completed that honeywell s computer programs will contain all of the necessary changes or meet all of the euro currency requirements 
based on its evaluation to date  management currently believes that  while honeywell will incur internal and external costs to address the euro currency issue  such costs will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of honeywell and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole  in future periods 
litigation on march   litton systems  inc filed a legal action against honeywell in us district court  central district of california  los angeles  with claims that were subsequently split into two separate cases 
one alleges patent infringement under federal law for using an ion beam process to coat mirrors incorporated in honeywell s ring laser gyroscopes  and tortious interference under state law for interfering with litton s prospective advantage with customers and contractual relationships with an inventor and his company  ojai research  inc the other case alleges monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal antitrust laws by honeywell in the sale of inertial reference systems containing ring laser gyroscopes into the commercial aircraft market 
honeywell generally denied litton s allegations in both cases 
in the patent tort case  honeywell also contested the validity as well as the infringement of the patent  alleging  among other things  that the patent had been obtained by litton s inequitable conduct before the united states patent and trademark office 
trials were held for both cases and at the conclusion of each  juries awarded litton significant monetary damages 
however  the awards were set aside by the trial court judge and new trials ordered on the issue of damages in each case 
following appeals by both parties of various issues related to these cases  the us supreme court remanded the patent tort case to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit for further proceedings  and the retrial of damages in the antitrust case was postponed indefinitely pending the outcome of the federal circuit proceeding 
for a detailed discussion of this litigation  see note to financial statements on page credit ratings as of december   honeywell s credit ratings for long term and short term debt  respectively  were a a by standard and poor s corporation  a p by moody s investors service  inc and a duff by duff and phelps corporation
