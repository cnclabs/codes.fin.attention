for approximately billion in cash and a billion short term note 
see k n midcon combination in the outlook forward looking information section of this report and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated earnings consolidated net income  diluted earnings per common share and return on average common equity for the three years ended december  were net income in millions earnings per common share return on average common equity net income and diluted earnings per share for represent increases of percent and percent  respectively  from this improvement resulted principally from the earnings contribution of the bushton assets acquired in april  the august startup of the pony express pipeline  earnings from the company s equity investments in the transcolorado pipeline and the coyote gulch gas treating plant  income related to the sale of a percent interest in en able  and a lower income tax provision 
to achieve its double digit earnings growth in  the company overcame several challenges  including losses in certain power marketing transactions  lower natural gas liquids ngls prices  record low demand for wholesale irrigation load in the texas intrastate market area and a delay in reaching full throughput capacity on the pony express pipeline which impacted operating results for both the gathering  processing and marketing  and the interstate pipeline segments 
these negative factors were mitigated by the company s decision to take advantage of favorable market conditions to effect certain transactions as discussed following 
the percent increase in diluted earnings per share from was primarily attributable to business growth on the interstate pipeline and gathering and processing systems  higher prices for ngls  expense savings from the corporate restructuring  and incremental sales of storage gas 
operating results for were adversely impacted by low demand for retail irrigation sales and transportation services due to abnormally heavy rainfall during the summer 
results of operations comparative operating results by business segment  consolidated other income and deductions and income taxes are presented below 
segment operating revenues  costs and expenses and volumetric data cited below are before intersegment eliminations  dollar amounts are in millions 
gathering  processing and marketing services operating revenues gas sales  natural gas liquids sales gathering  transportation and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales   operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus gas sales gathering and transportation natural gas liquids sales million gallons company owned and processed third party marketed the significant increases in operating revenues  costs and expenses and volumetric data largely reflect the acquisition of the bushton gathering and processing assets effective april  other operating revenues and other costs of sales also reflect a significant increase in power marketing activity which  as discussed below  was suspended in the third quarter 
the bushton acquisition contributed incremental operating revenues of million and operating income of million 
this segment s operating income was level with the prior year s results  as operations were adversely impacted by losses from certain power marketing transactions  lower ngls prices  reduced wholesale irrigation demand trillion btus below deliveries due to abundant rainfall in the texas intrastate market area and million of expenses incurred to centralize the company s marketing activities in houston 
during  losses of approximately million were incurred in connection with certain power marketing transactions which were not in compliance with the company s risk management policies 
subsequently  power marketing activities were suspended in the third quarter 
excluding the bushton facility  average ngls prices in were per gallon lower than  creating a negative impact on operating income of approximately million 
irrigation related gas marketing and transportation and storage margins were adversely impacted by approximately million due to the abnormally wet summer 
additionally  the delay until january in reaching full throughput capability on the pony express pipeline limited growth in gathering and processing volumes at the company s expanded douglas plant and marketing opportunities into the kansas city area  as upstream business expansion opportunities off the pony express pipeline were expected to offset on going declines in certain producing areas 
the cumulative unfavorable earnings impact of these events was substantially mitigated by increased sales of storage gas and the sale of certain non strategic gas supply  ngls marketing and storage related contracts 
these transactions  aggregating million of net margin increases over similar transactions in  essentially offset the losses and negative market circumstances enumerated above 
the company currently expects that future margins from storage sales will be less 
the percent increase in operating income over largely resulted from three factors growth in volumes principally due to acquisitions  the wildhorse joint venture with tom brown  inc  and sales of storage gas  higher ngls prices and expense savings accruing from the corporate restructuring 
this segment did experience compression of margins during in all three of its principal activities gas sales  ngls sales and transportation and gathering services due to competitive factors and significantly higher gas costs influenced by colder weather nationwide 
average ngls sales prices exceeded those realized in by per gallon 
however  the impact of higher ngls prices was partially offset by the effect of higher gas prices on shrink and fuel payments to producers under keep whole processing agreements 
interstate transportation and storage services operating revenues transportation and storage other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus the pony express pipeline accounted for the majority of the improvement in the interstate pipeline s operating income  despite regulatory delays in commencing the project and operational delays in reaching its design capability 
additionally  operating results were positively impacted by increased gas supply requirements in the company s retail natural gas services segment resulting from colder weather and higher irrigation demand 
effective august   the casper processing plant was transferred to an unregulated subsidiary included in the gathering  processing and marketing segment 
the reduction in other operating revenues and gas purchases and other costs of sales is primarily due to this transfer 
this segment s results showed substantial improvement over as throughput and demand revenues increased due to mid year system expansions in wyoming 
throughput in was adversely affected by below normal irrigation load on the company s retail segment served by the interstate pipeline 
lower operations and maintenance and payroll taxes resulted from expense savings due to the corporate restructuring 
retail natural gas services operating revenues gas sales transportation and other operating costs and expenses gas purchases and other costs of sales operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes  other than income taxes operating income systems throughput trillion btus gas sales transportation operating income in as compared to was positively affected by increased demand for space heating and irrigation due to colder weather and less rainfall during the summer 
although approximately percent below a normal year  irrigation deliveries of trillion btus in exceeded requirements by trillion btus 
the impact of company wide expense controls on operations and maintenance costs is most apparent in this segment  as this segment has not experienced significant acquisitions or expansion projects this year 
operating results for were adversely impacted by low demand for irrigation requirements due to abnormally heavy rainfall during the summer 
irrigation sales and transportation volumes in were trillion btus below the season 
deliveries to irrigators of trillion btus in were more indicative of a normal year s load 
this negative impact on earnings was partially mitigated by increased customer requirements for grain drying and growth in transportation volumes on the rocky mountain intrastate pipeline due to the fourth quarter acquisition of interconnected gathering and processing facilities 
operations and maintenance expenses were percent higher than in  as costs incurred in the development of new marketing initiatives exceeded savings realized from the corporate restructuring 
other income and deductions interest expense minority interests and other  net increases in the most recent two years interest expense result from the issuance of long term debt in and and higher levels of short term borrowings incurred principally to fund capital expenditures 
in and  the company capitalized million and million  respectively  of interest costs primarily related to the construction of the pony express pipeline 
minority interests and other  net for includes million of earnings from the company s equity investments in the transcolorado pipeline and the coyote gulch gas treating plant  and million of income related to the sale of a percent interest in en able  with no corresponding amounts in net gains totaling million on the sale of several non strategic gathering systems and  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  the capitalization of equity financing costs of million related to the pony express pipeline  more than offset the million of financing costs included in minority interests associated with the preferred capital trust securities issued in april income taxes provisions effective tax rate the reduced provision for income taxes and the resulting reduction in the effective tax rate are due to the successful resolution of certain issues from prior years income tax filings 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory rate to yearly effective rates 
liquidity and capital resources during the primary sources of cash were from internally generated cash flows  the public offerings of long term debt and preferred capital trust securities and short term borrowings 
cash outflows funded capital expenditures and acquisitions  debt service and dividend payments 
cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from operating activities for totaled million  compared with million and million for and  respectively 
the improvement in s net operating cash flows was largely attributable to the same factors resulting in the reported increase in earnings 
net operating cash flows in were primarily negatively impacted by disbursements to buyout above market gas purchase contracts and increases in storage gas inventories 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures of million in were significantly higher than expenditures of million in and million in the large increase in capital expenditures resulted from the completion of the pony express pipeline  construction of transmission laterals into the kansas city metropolitan area  and capital investment related to the bushton acquisition  including initial expenditures to reduce field pressures in the hugoton basin 
the capital expenditures budget totals million before adjustment to reflect the consolidation with midcon 
budgeted maintenance  safety and environmental expenditures approximate million and budgeted business growth or expansion expenditures approximate million 
principal acquisitions or investments made during included the bushton gas gathering and processing assets effective in april  interenergy effective in december primarily a gathering and marketing entity and an interest in the red cedar gathering company acquired at year end 
see notes a  c and b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources at december   the company had a credit agreement with banks the pre acquisition facility pursuant to which the company could borrow or provide support for commercial paper issuance up to a total of million 
borrowings under the pre acquisition facility were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the pre acquisition facility was terminated in january and replaced with new credit lines and an acquisition facility in conjunction with the acquisition of midcon 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  following a review of the k n midcon combination  fitch investors service fitch  moody s investors service moody s and standard poor s s p lowered their ratings of the company s senior unsecured debt 
fitch lowered its rating from a to bbb  moody s lowered its rating from a to baa and s p lowered its rating from bbb to bbb 
the company intends to strengthen its balance sheet during by public equity offerings  limiting capital expenditures for both midcon and the historical k n companies and increasing internally generated cash flows 
in recent years  the company s capitalization has averaged approximately percent debt to percent equity 
as a result of the acquisition of midcon on january   the company s leverage has increased significantly through the utilization of an acquisition debt facility and new revolving credit facilities 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has in place a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in a total amount of billion  pursuant to which  as of march   the company had agreed to the pricing for public sale of billion principal amount of debt securities of varying maturities and million shares of common stock up to million shares if the underwriters over allotment option is fully exercised 
the proceeds of these offerings are expected to be used to repay the acquisition debt associated with the purchase of midcon and purchase us government securities to serve as a portion of the collateral required for the note issued to the seller in the midcon acquisition 
the company s future financing plans include the public issuance of other securities  including trust securities which are mandatorily redeemable or convertible 
the company currently expects that  even if it is successful in completing both the offerings currently in progress and its planned offerings  its degree of leverage in the near term will remain significantly above historical levels 
regulation in  approximately percent of the company s operating income was derived from assets which are rate regulated at either the federal  state or local level 
at least in the near term  a significantly higher percentage of the company s operating income is expected to be derived from rate regulated operations as a result of the acquisition of midcon 
in substantially all regulatory jurisdictions  rates are currently determined using cost based regulation and  at this time  the company does not expect a significant change in the manner in which rates are set 
thus far  the primary impact of competition on the company s regulated businesses has been the conversion of services from the bundled merchant and transportation function including the pass through of actual gas costs expended to transportation services only 
the company anticipates that this conversion to transportation service will continue and become more prevalent at the retail level 
during  k n will continue to implement its choice gas program in nebraska  pursuant to which approximately  retail customers will be able to choose their gas supplier
