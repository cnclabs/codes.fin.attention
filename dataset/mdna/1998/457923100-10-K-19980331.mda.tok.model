the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
overview the company was founded in to design and develop engineering test stations to test and measure complex electronic devices at the prototype stage 
the company was acquired by valid logic in and then by cadence in as a result of the merger of valid logic into cadence 
cadence operated the company as a separate subsidiary 
in july  the company successfully completed an initial public offering of common stock  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
at december   cadence owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company  with the remaining publicly owned 
in february  the company completed a secondary public offering of its common stock  including  shares issued by the company  and  sold by cadence  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
following the secondary public offering  cadence continued to own approximately of the company s common stock 
the company has been profitable for each of the last ten years and has financed its business activities during that period principally through cash generated from its own operations 
the company s net sales increased from to at an annually compounded rate of  reflecting the company s successful introduction of higher margin test station and virtual test software products during these periods 
during  net sales declined from as a result of the delay of orders anticipated from certain customers for the company s test station products into future periods 
these sales trends  combined with moderate growth in operating expenses  resulted in net income of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
during the last three years  the company has generated the majority of its revenue from sales of its xl  ats  ats blazer  ft and msts test station product families and related software 
virtual test software and related services accounted for  and of the company s net sales during  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  the company introduced testdirect tm  a new digital virtual test productivity software tool 
testdirect provides test engineers with an automated tool for generating test patterns for automated test equipment from the designer s original simulation process 
this product shortens the customers overall product development cycle and improves time to market 
testdirect contributed approximately of net sales during the second half of also announced during the first quarter of was the new xts test station  which extends the pin count of the company s ats test stations to a new high of i o pins 
the xts test station began shipping in the third quarter of and contributed of net sales for the second half of future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  receipt  timing and shipment of major system orders  the introduction of new products by the company and by its competitors  the company s ability to operate independently from cadence  and industry acceptance of virtual test software 
results of operations for the periods discussed here should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period  and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that such growth will be sustained in future periods or that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales

product sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the shortfall in test station product sales  which was partially offset by a increase in sales of virtual test software products 
service and other sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due principally to growth in sales of virtual test related services 
combined sales of virtual test software product and virtual test software related services grew to of net sales during the year  compared to in international sales  as a percentage of the company s net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to increased sales in europe and asia  and relatively weaker performance in north america 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of material  labor  manufacturing and service overhead as well as amortization of capitalized software development costs 
total cost of sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  product cost of sales decreased from million for the year to million for  primarily due to lower product sales volume and certain reductions in material costs 
service and other cost of sales decreased from million in the year to million in  due primarily to a non recurring charge in the first quarter of for the company s change in accounting for spare parts  partially offset by increased labor costs associated with virtual test software related services 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  product gross margin  as a percent of related sales  increased from for the year  to for the increase in product gross margin resulted from an increase in sales of virtual test software products during  partially offset by a slight decline in gross margin realized on sales of the company s test station products 
service and other gross margin  as a percent of related sales  increased from for to for  due primarily to the non recurring charge to cost of service and other sales related to the change in accounting method for spare parts in research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation of equipment and engineering related costs 
research  development and engineering expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  research  development and engineering expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in reported research  development and engineering expense was principally attributable to greater capitalization of software development costs associated with development of the company s new products during while gross research  development and engineering spending remained approximately flat from to the company plans to increase the dollar amount of research  development and engineering in the future  if and when growth in net sales makes it prudent to do so  reflecting the company s strategy to invest in new products and existing product enhancements 
the company has capitalized certain software development costs relating to these activities  in compliance with sfas no 
 in the amounts of million and in and  respectively 
capitalization of software development costs was offset by amortization of previously capitalized costs to product cost of sales in the amount of and during and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and commissions of sales  marketing and administrative personnel  and other marketing and general administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to higher commissions and increased investment in the company s selling function 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  due to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses combined with the impact of lower net sales discussed above 
the company anticipates that selling and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount in the future  as the company continues to expand its distribution infrastructure 
following the company s secondary stock offering in february  cadence s ownership of the company s common stock dropped below  requiring the company to recognize additional compensation expense of approximately during  as a result of payments made by cadence to certain company employees in respect of cadence stock options held by such employees 
other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income  interest expense and gain and loss on sale of assets 
other income  net increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the increase was due to interest income on higher average cash and investment balances  combined with the impact of a one time write off of expenses associated with the company s withdrawn secondary public stock offering in june  due to unfavorable capital market conditions at that time 
costs of the company s successful stock offering in february were charged as an offset to the offering proceeds in shareholders equity 
income taxes 
the company s effective rate for federal and state taxes was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the change in effective tax rates from to was primarily due to increased research and development tax credits during years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in product sales of from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the successful introduction of the company s ats ft test stations  which contributed of net sales during  continued contributions from the company s ats blazer and xl test station products and a increase in sales of virtual test software 
service and other sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due principally to growth in sales of virtual test software related services 
combined sales of virtual test software product and virtual test software related services grew to of net sales during the year  compared to in international sales  as a percentage of the company s net sales  declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to general economic weakness and slowing down of customer capital expenditures in europe  japan and korea 
cost of sales

research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  research  development and engineering expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased expenditures on enhancements to the company s existing products and the development of future generation hardware and software products 
the company has capitalized certain software development costs relating to these activities  in compliance with sfas no 
 in the amounts of and million in and  respectively 
capitalization of software development costs was offset by amortization of previously capitalized costs to product cost of sales in the amount of and  during and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to higher commissions associated with higher sales volume and increased investment in the various selling and marketing functions 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  as a result of control over increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as net sales grew 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  due to the one time write off of expenses associated with the company s withdrawn secondary public stock offering in june  due to unfavorable stock market conditions at that time 
income taxes 
the company s effective rate for federal and state taxes was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the change in effective tax rates from to was primarily due to the generation of research and development tax credits during future operating results results of operations for the periods discussed above should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period  and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
like most high technology and high growth companies  the company faces certain business risks that could have adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  sales to intel corporation represented approximately   and of the company s net sales  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in   or for  of net sales came from customers individually accounting for less than of net sales 
sales of the company s products to intel and a limited number of other customers are expected to continue to account for a high percentage of net sales over the foreseeable future 
any sudden reduction or loss of orders from intel or any other major customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
like most high technology and high growth companies  the company faces certain business risks that could have adverse effects on the company s results of operations  including  but not limited to the following 
the company is dependent on high dollar customer orders  deriving a substantial portion of its net sales from the sale of test stations which typically range in price from million to million per unit and may be priced as high as million for a single unit 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales are typically realized in the last few days of each quarter 
as evidenced by the impact of the delays of orders for the company s test station products discussed above  the timing of the receipt and shipment  and the magnitude of the sales price  of a single order can have a significant impact on the company s net sales and results of operations for a particular quarter and the company s quarterly net sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted if an order is received too late in a given quarter to permit product shipment and the recognition of revenue during that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and planned expenditures are based  in part  on anticipated orders 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research  development and engineering makes it difficult to reduce expenses in a particular quarter if the company s sales goals for that quarter are not met 
the inability to reduce the company s expenses quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of any revenue shortfall on the company s results of operations 
the company purchases some key components from sole or single source vendors  for which alternative sources are not readily available 
a few of these suppliers are small independent companies and could expose the company to increased risk of delivery problems for certain key components 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are also subject to influences driven by rapid technological changes  a highly competitive industry  a lengthy sales cycle  and the cyclical nature of general economic conditions 
during  approximately the company s net sales were to customers in the asia pacific region 
these sales were predominantly to asian locations of us based multinational companies  but also included sales to companies headquartered in japan  korea  taiwan  and singapore 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant impact on net sales from the current financial crisis in the asia pacific region 
there can be no assurance that the asia pacific financial crisis will not negatively impact the company s future net sales 
based on a recent assessment  the company believes that no material modifications to its products are required to be year compliant 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure for year compliance 
the company believes that year compliance for its core operating and financial management applications will be achieved as a result of upgrades to existing software already being planned 
as a result  the company does not currently expect incremental costs necessary to modify the company s information technology infrastructure to be year compliant to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company has efforts underway to assess the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and customers 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers or customers do not successfully and in a timely manner achieve year compliance  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company and by its competitors  industry acceptance of virtual test software  the level and timing of available shippable orders and backlog  and the business risks discussed above 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that such growth will be sustained in future periods or that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  and funds available under an existing bank line of credit of million 
since  the company has relied on cash generated from operations as its principal source of liquidity and has not relied on cadence for working capital 
operating activities 
the company s net cash from operating activities includes cash received from customers  payments to suppliers  payments to employees and interest received and paid 
net cash generated from operating activities amounted to million  million and million for   and  respectively 
cash received from customers amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
combined payments to suppliers and employees for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the period to period changes in cash from customers and payments to suppliers and employees are directly related to the changes in net sales and expenses associated with those sales 
the company s trade receivables  inventories and accounts payable have fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of shipments  cash collections and inventory receipts near period end 
the size and timing of a single customer shipment or collection can have a significant impact on trade receivables and inventories 
trade receivables decreased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting the fourth quarter delay in customer orders discussed above  partially offset by the impact of extended payment terms granted to certain customers and distributors during  especially in the asia pacific region 
the financial difficulties facing the asia pacific region may cause these receivables to age further in inventories increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to additional parts inventories required to produce the company s new products  and the impact of the delay in orders experienced at the end of as a result of cash flows from operating activities  combined with the proceeds of the company s secondary public offering in of million  the company has increased its cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances from million at december  to million at december  investing activities 
capital equipment expenditures of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  were primarily for computers  software  demonstration equipment and engineering equipment used in the company s operations 
expenditures to increase the company s service spare parts pool were million  million and for  and  respectively 
the increases in spare parts reflects the stocking of parts for servicing the company s new ats ft  msts and xts test station product lines 
in addition  the company capitalized certain expenses associated with software development costs of million  and million for  and  respectively 
the company has invested amounts equal to compensation deferred by executive management under the terms of the company s non qualified deferred compensation plan  in the amounts of and for the years and  respectively 
financing activities 
in and  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million  respectively 
in  net cash used by financing activities amounted to cash provided by financing activities during and was attributable to the proceeds from the company s secondary and initial public offerings of common stock  respectively 
cash used for payments of certain capital leases obtained by the company for computers and equipment used in operations was  and for  and  respectively 
in  and  the company received million  and  respectively  from the issuance of stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
the company realized reductions in current income tax liabilities of million  million and million during  and  respectively  resulting from the benefit of tax deductions of employee gains upon exercise of cadence stock options  and to a lesser extent from the exercise of the company s employee stock options 
the tax benefit of the stock option deduction is reflected as an increase in additional paid in capital in the accompanying statements of shareholders equity 
the employee gains are not expenses of the company for financial reporting purposes  and the exercise of cadence stock options does not increase the number of shares of company common stock outstanding 
the tax benefits realized from the stock option deduction will decrease in the future as employee holdings of cadence stock options decline due to option exercises and cancellations 
the timing and magnitude of this decrease in tax benefits is uncertain as the number of employee stock options which are exercised  and the amount of gains realized upon exercise  will be determined by fluctuations in the market value of cadence common stock 
such future decreases in the tax benefits from the stock option deduction will increase the amount of the company s income tax payments and will  consequently  reduce the company s net cash flows from operating activities 
at the end of  the company secured a million revolving line of credit with us national bank of oregon  which is available for general corporate purposes when needed 
under the agreement  the company can borrow  with interest at the bank s prime lending rate  or if lower  at certain margins above banker s acceptance or interbank offering rates 
there have been no borrowings against the line of credit to date 
the term of the current credit line agreement ends april  it is management s intent to renew the agreement at that time 
the company believes that existing funds  funds expected to be generated by operating activities  and the available line of credit  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and other general corporate purposes through at least the next twelve months 
the company currently has no significant capital commitments other than commitments under facility operating leases and vendor contracts for development services  consulting services and parts 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company presently has no significant understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital or require the issuance of additional equity
