market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company utilizes foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  japanese yen  german mark  french franc and canadian dollar 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures daily to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the company s foreign exchange instruments outstanding at february   the company estimates a maximum potential one day loss in fair value of million  using a value at risk var model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various types of modeling techniques that can be used in a var computation  the company used a monte carlo simulation type model that valued its foreign currency instruments against a thousand randomly generated market price paths 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during fiscal years  and marketable securities the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at february  was billion 
the company s investment policy is to manage its marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through the use of different investment brokers 
the company s marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at february   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively  in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
factors affecting the company s business and prospects there are numerous factors that may affect the company s business and the results of its operations 
these factors include general economic and business conditions  the level of demand for personal computers  the level and intensity of competition in the personal computer industry and the pricing pressures that may result  the ability of the company to timely and effectively manage periodic product transitions and component availability  the ability of the company to develop new products based on new or evolving technology and the market s acceptance of those products  the ability of the company to manage its inventory levels to minimize excess inventory  declining inventory values and obsolescence  the product  customer and geographic sales mix of any particular period  the company s ability to continue to improve its infrastructure including personnel and systems to keep pace with the growth in its overall business activities  and the company s ability to ensure its products and information systems and those of its third party providers will be year compliant
