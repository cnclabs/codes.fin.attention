inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the cost of operating resorts increases the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers  however there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s ski and resort operations are extremely seasonal in nature

based on the company s new fiscal year ended july   of total resort revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters

the company is taking steps to smooth its earnings throughout the fiscal year by investing in additional summer activities such as golf course development 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial highlights 
economic downturn 
skiing is a discretionary recreational activity that can be impacted by a significant economic slowdown which could impact the company s operating results 
although historically economic downturns have not had an adverse impact on the company s operating results  there can be no assurance that a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending by the public in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s business 
unfavorable weather conditions the ski industry s ability to attract visitors to its resorts is influenced by weather conditions and the amount of snowfall during the ski season 
unfavorable weather conditions can adversely effect skier days 
in the past years the company s resorts have averaged between and inches of annual snowfall  significantly in excess of the average for us ski resorts 
despite the substantial snowfall  the company manages its exposure to unfavorable weather conditions by investing in the latest technology in snowmaking systems and actively acquiring additional water rights  which has allowed it to offer it s guests more predictable and more consistent conditions  particularly during the early and late ski season 
although historically unfavorable weather conditions have not had a materially adverse impact on the company s operating results  there can be no assurance that unfavorable weather conditions in the future would not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
year compliance the year issue is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system job failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
the company s integral computer software  resort pos  has been designed with the year issue in mind  and to be year compliant  however  the company utilizes many different systems and software programs to process and summarize business transactions 
the company is continuing the evaluation of its various operating systems and determining the additional remediation efforts required to ensure its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  preliminary results of this assessment have revealed that remediation efforts required will vary from system to system 
for example  it appears some systems will not require any additional programming efforts  while others may require significant programming changes 
the company has begun and  in certain cases  completed remediation efforts for many of its computer systems identified as non compliant  beginning with those systems identified by the company as mission critical 
the company has and will continue to utilize both internal and external resources to test its software for year compliance and to reprogram or replace any non compliant software that is identified by the company as mission critical 
the company plans to complete the year project before december  the total estimated multi year cost of the year project is estimated to be between  and  these costs are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software or equipment which will be capitalized 
the remaining  to  will be expensed as incurred 
in a number of instances  the company may decide to install new software or upgraded versions of current software programs which are year compliant 
in these instances  the company may capitalize certain costs of the new system in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software for those sites which it believes may be affected  the effects of year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s reasonable estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
