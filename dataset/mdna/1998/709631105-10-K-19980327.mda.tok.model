outlook the company is targeting to surpass the billion sales level for  before the impact of acquisitions 
while the outlook for each of its segments is very encouraging in  as noted below  pentair has determined that to achieve financial results comparable to those of top performing benchmark companies  it must improve its performance on a company wide basis 
to do so  the company is targeting significant improvements in free cash flow and management of total capital 
in addition  the company has adopted a year target to achieve a million reduction from its planned cost structure 
these gains are anticipated to come from improved cooperation and standardization across all operating units in such areas as transportation  administrative services  outsourcing  and purchasing 
this effort will alter historical management patterns  enabling synergies between all businesses 
the company continues to look for synergistic acquisitions in each of its business segments  in line with its pattern over the past three years 
of the past nine acquisitions  most were smaller businesses or product lines which fit with existing operations  offering new products or expanded geographic scope 
two  however  were stand alone strategic acquisitions of large established businesses  and helped create pentair s latest business segment  water and fluid technologies 
pentair intends to continue to pursue smaller  bolt on purchases  but will also carefully review larger targets which have the capability to significantly expand its current segments 
other acquisitions are possible  but only if they present extraordinary opportunities to pentair 
segment discussion pentair has realigned its operating businesses into three segments to reflect its growing focus in its chosen markets professional tools and equipment pte  water and fluid technologies wft  and electrical and electronic enclosures eee 
professional tools and equipment the pte segment includes delta international machinery  porter cable  lincoln automotive and century manufacturing 
products manufactured include woodworking machinery  portable power tools  battery charging and testing equipment  welding equipment  and lubricating and lifting equipment 
versus pte sales increased million or 
the full year effect of acquisitions contributed to less than half of the growth in sales 
substantial growth was achieved in the tool business due to the introduction of new products  increased brand awareness and continued expansion of the home center channel

versus pte sales increased million or  propelled by new product introductions  expanded distribution in home center and hardware channels  and the partial year effect of acquisitions 
operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in due to favorable product mix  volume efficiencies  and productivity gains 
outlook the professional tools and equipment segment has tremendous momentum going into and sales growth is expected to continue to be in double digits due to product line expansions and cross marketing through multiple channels of distribution 
margins are anticipated to improve slightly  especially from the full impact of improvements currently being made in recent acquisitions 
water and fluid technologies the wft segment includes the pentair pump business  fleck controls and lincoln industrial 
products manufactured include pumps for wells and water treatment  sump pumps  valves for water softeners  and automated and manual lubrication systems and equipment

outlook the water and fluid technologies segment will benefit from full year operations from the recently acquired pump businesses as the overall integration of the pentair pump business continues  driving down costs and improving productivity via rationalization of products  redesign of processes  and the anticipated divestiture or closure of unprofitable product lines 
the automated lubrication and material dispensing business will work to increase its presence in global markets and will expand its product offerings as a result of its january acquisition of orsco  inc  a manufacturer of automated lubricating equipment
