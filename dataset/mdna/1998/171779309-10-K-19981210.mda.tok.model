overview ciena corporation designs  manufactures and sells open architecture  dwdm systems for fiberoptic communications networks  including long distance and local exchange carriers 
ciena also provides a range of engineering  furnishing and installation services for telecommunications service providers 
fiscal was a year of dramatic events affecting the company 
soon after the close of the first fiscal quarter  mciworldcom  the company s largest customer of fiscal  surprised the company with an announcement of a major change in purchasing practices a change that meant materially reduced revenue for the company 
this adverse event was followed in the second quarter by the company s successful  large scale commercial introduction of the company s industry leading channel multiwave sentry the third quarter included resolution of the company s longstanding pirelli spa pirelli litigation  which was followed on june  with the announcement of a planned merger with tellabs  inc in the fourth quarter  just prior to consummation of the merger  at t advised the company that it would no longer consider ciena s long distance dwdm products for deployment in at t s network 
the planned merger with tellabs was later terminated on september  the company s final results for fiscal  its second full year in the dwdm marketplace  show total revenues in excess of million 
the company believes this represents a considerable achievement  particularly given the substantial portion of revenues derived from the sale of its now third generation dwdm product  the multiwave sentry nevertheless  the termination of the tellabs merger represented a setback for the company 
the outlook for fiscal is challenging 
the price discounting offered by competitors striving to catch up to the company and acquire market share has placed pressure on gross margins and operating profitability 
but market demand for high bandwidth solutions still appears robust  and the company believes that its product and service quality  manufacturing experience  and proven track record of delivery will enable it to endure the gross margin pressure while it concentrates on efforts to reduce product costs and maximize production efficiencies 
the company intends to continue this strategy in order to preserve and enhance market leadership and eventually build on its installed base with new and additional products 
pursuit of this strategy  in conjunction with increased investments in selling  marketing  and customer service activities  will likely limit the company s operating profitability over at least the first half of fiscal  and may result in near term operating losses 
highlights of the fiscal year the company recognizes product revenue in accordance with the shipping terms specified 
for transactions where the company has yet to obtain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case revenues for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
revenues from installation service fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
for distributor sales where risks of ownership have not transferred  the company recognizes revenue when the product is shipped to the end user 
for the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded million in revenue of which million was from sales to sprint 
the company increased the total number of customers for dwdm systems from five customers in fiscal to fourteen customers in fiscal revenue from sales to worldcom declined from approximately million in fiscal to an amount less than of the company s total fiscal revenue 
substantially all of the revenue recognized from the sales to worldcom occurred in the company s first quarter ended january  in addition to sprint and worldcom  during the fiscal year ended october  the company recognized revenue from cable and wireless  hermes  enron  racal  telia of sweden  td of france  dti  gst  and  through the company s distributor  nissho electronics corporation nissho  sales to teleway  japan telecom and to ddi 
the company also recognized an immaterial amount of revenue from one undisclosed customer 
during december the company acquired astracom  an early stage telecommunications company located in atlanta  georgia 
the employees of astracom were immediately deployed to assist with the company s development efforts from its multiwave metro product 
the purchase price was approximately million and consisted of the issuance of  shares of ciena common stock  the payment of million in cash  and the assumption of certain stock options 
the transaction was recorded using the purchase accounting method with the purchase price representing approximately million in goodwill and other intangibles  and approximately million in net assets assumed 
the amortization period for the intangibles  based on management s estimate of the useful life of the acquired technology  is five years 
in february the company acquired alta  a canadian corporation headquartered near atlanta  georgia  in a transaction valued at approximately million 
alta provides a range of engineering  furnishing and installation services for telecommunications service providers in the areas of transport  switching and wireless communications 
under the terms of the agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of alta in exchange for  shares of ciena common stock 
the transaction constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interest under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of alta as though it had always been a part of ciena 
in march the company announced an agreement to supply bell atlantic with dwdm optical transmission systems 
the supply agreement has no minimum purchase commitments and includes the company s multiwave  sentry and firefly systems 
deployment and revenue recognition is expected in the first half of calendar  subject to successful completion of ongoing testing 
the bell atlantic dwdm deployment is expected to mark the first time a rboc has committed to deployment of dwdm equipment 
during april the company acquired terabit  a developer of optical components known as photodetectors or optical receivers 
the company believes the technology currently under development at terabit may give it a strategic advantage over its competitors 
terabit is located in santa barbara  california 
the purchase price was approximately million and consisted of the issuance of  shares of ciena common stock  the payment of million in cash  and the assumption of certain stock options 
the transaction was recorded using the purchase accounting method with the purchase price representing approximately million in purchased research and development  million in goodwill and other intangibles  and approximately million in net assets assumed 
the amortization period for the intangibles  based on management s estimate of the useful life of the acquired technology  is five years 
from december until june  the company was involved in litigation with pirelli 
on june   the company announced the resolution of all pending litigation with pirelli 
the terms of the settlement involved the dismissal of pirelli s three lawsuits against the company that were pending in delaware  dismissal of the company s legal proceedings against pirelli in the united states international trade commission  payment to pirelli of million and certain running royalties  a worldwide  non exclusive cross license to each party s patent portfolios  and a year moratorium on future litigation between the parties 
the company recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended october   relating to legal fees and the ultimate settlement to pirelli 
the payment of future royalties due to pirelli is based upon future revenues derived from the licensed technology 
the company does not expect the future royalty payments to have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
on june  the company announced an agreement to merge with tellabs  inc tellabs  a delaware corporation headquartered in lisle  illinois 
tellabs designs  manufactures  markets and services voice and data transport network access systems 
under the terms of the original agreement  all outstanding shares of ciena stock were to have been exchanged at the ratio of one share of tellabs common stock for each share of ciena common stock 
on august  the company was informed by at t that at t had decided not to pursue further evaluation of ciena s dwdm systems 
following the impact of the at t announcement on the market prices of the common stock of the respective companies  the company and tellabs management renegotiated the terms of the merger agreement  and on august  announced an amendment to the original merger agreement which was approved by the respective companys boards of directors 
under the terms of the agreement as amended  all outstanding shares of ciena stock were to have been exchanged at the ratio of share of tellabs common stock for each share of ciena common stock 
subsequent to august   further adverse investor reaction raised serious questions about the ultimate ability to obtain shareholder approval for the merger 
an agreement to terminate the merger was announced on september  in june at the supercomm trade show in atlanta  georgia  the company demonstrated its multiwave metro tm metro dwdm system for metropolitan and local access applications 
metro enables carriers to offer multi protocol high bandwidth services economically using their existing network infrastructure 
the metro product is expected to be commercially available by the first quarter of calendar the company also demonstrated at the supercom trade show a channel dwdm system 
the channel dwdm system is expected to be commercially available during the first half of calendar see risk factors 
the company had previously announced that at t was evaluating a customized version of its multiwave sentry system 
in july at t indicated to the company that capacity requirements of its network had grown to such extent that the delays in final certification and approval for deployment of the company s customized channel system would make actual deployment of that system inadvisable  and that at t would accordingly shift to an accelerated evaluation of commercially available  higher channel count systems 
the company believed at t would evaluate the company s multiwave r system positively in this context  particularly because the company believes it is the only manufacturer in the world with operational channel systems ready for prompt delivery on an off the shelf basis in substantial manufacturing volumes 
however  on august  the company was informed by at t that at t had decided not to pursue further evaluation of ciena s dwdm systems 
during the first quarter of the company continued its effort to expand its manufacturing capabilities by leasing an additional facility of approximately  square feet located in the linthicum  maryland area 
this facility is used for manufacturing and customer service activities 
in april the company leased an additional manufacturing facility in the linthicum area of approximately  square feet 
with the addition of this new facility the company has a total of four facilities with approximately  square feet that can be used for manufacturing operations 
in april the company completed the transfer of its principal executive  sales  and marketing functions located in linthicum in a portion of its  square foot facility to an approximately  square foot facility also located in linthicum 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the process of renovating the vacated portions of the  square foot facility for the purpose of accommodating expanding research and development functions 
as of october  the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was an increase of persons over the approximate employed on october  results of operations fiscal years ended  and revenue 
the company recognized million  million and million in revenue for the years ended october   and  respectively 
sales to sprint accounted for million  million and million  of the company s revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
while worldcom accounted for million of the company s revenue during fiscal  it was not a significant contributor to fiscal revenues 
there were no other customers who accounted for or more of the company s revenues during fiscal  and revenue derived from foreign sales accounted for approximately  
and of the company s revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects sprint s purchases in fiscal to be focused primarily on filling out installed systems with additional channel cards and therefore substantially below the purchasing volume in either of the last two years 
the company also expects the percentage of fiscal revenue derived from foreign sales to increase relative to fiscal based on overall new bid activity as well as expected deployment plans of existing customers  the company believes revenue growth in fiscal over fiscal is possible  but will be highly dependent on winning new bids for shipments from new and existing customers during the year 
competition of new bids is intense  and there is no assurance the company will be successful in winning enough new bids and new customers to achieve year over year sequential growth 
see risk factors 
the company began shipping multiwave systems for field testing in may with customer acceptance by sprint occurring in july for fiscal years and all of the company s dwdm system revenues were derived form the multiwave product 
during fiscal the company began shipments of and recognized revenues from sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave firefly  and multiwave sentry systems 
the amount of revenue recognized from multiwave sales declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline in multiwave sales in fiscal was offset by revenue recognized from sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave firefly  and multiwave sentry systems 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing and engineering  furnishing and installation operations 
gross profit was million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
gross margin was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal was attributable to increased revenues 
the decrease in gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal was largely attributable to lower selling prices 
the increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of a change in product mix from revenues largely derived from lower margin engineering  furnishing and installation sales to higher margin multiwave product sales 
this year to year increase was also attributable to fixed overhead costs being allocated over a larger revenue base  an improvement in manufacturing efficiencies  and reductions in component costs 
the company s gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including continued competitive market pricing  lower manufacturing volumes and efficiencies and fluctuations in component costs 
during fiscal  the company expects to face continued pressure on gross margins  primarily as a result of substantial price discounting by competitors seeking to acquire market share 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to fiscal in research and development expenses related to increased staffing levels  purchases of materials used in development of new or enhanced product prototypes  and outside consulting services in support of certain developments and design efforts 
during fiscal   and research and development expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase moderately in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal to support the continued development of the various dwdm products  the exploration of new or complementary technologies  and the pursuit of various cost reduction strategies 
the company has expensed research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to fiscal in selling and marketing expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels in the areas of sales  technical assistance and field support  and increases in commissions earned  trade show participation and promotional costs 
during fiscal   and selling and marketing expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company anticipates that its selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as additional personnel are hired and additional offices are opened to allow the company to pursue new customers and market opportunities 
the company also expects the portion of selling and marketing expenses attributable to technical assistance and field support  specifically in europe and asia  will increase as the company s installed base of operational multiwave systems increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to fiscal in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels and outside consulting services 
during fiscal  and  general and administrative expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will moderately increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as a result of the expansion of the company s administrative staff required to support its expanding operations 
purchased research and development 
purchased research and development costs were million for the fiscal year these costs were for the purchase of technology and related assets associated with the acquisition of terabit during the second quarter of fiscal pirelli litigation 
the pirelli litigation costs of million in fiscal were attributable to a million payment made to pirelli during the third quarter of and to additional other legal and related costs incurred in connection with the settlement of this litigation 
the pirelli litigation expense in fiscal was primarily the result of a million charge for actual and estimated legal and related costs associated with the litigation 
costs of proposed merger 
the costs of the proposed merger for fiscal were costs related to the contemplated merger between the company and tellabs 
these costs include approximately million in securities and exchange commission filing fees and approximately million in legal  accounting  and other related expenses 
operating profit 
the company s operating profit for fiscal  and was million or of revenue  million or and million or  respectively 
excluding charges for purchased research and development  pirelli litigation and costs from the proposed tellabs merger fiscal operating profit was million or of revenue and excluding pirelli litigation costs in fiscal operating profit was million or 
the decrease in operating profit and operating margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased competitive pricing pressures causing a reduction in gross profit margin and increased operating expenses from investments in operating infrastructure 
the year to year increases in operating profits from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the comparable increases in revenues and gross profits derived from the company s multiwave systems 
if the company is unable to convert fiscal investments in operating infrastructure into significant revenue generating relationships  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
see risk factors 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  net of interest expense associated with the company s debt obligations 
other income expense  net  was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the year to year increase in other income expense  net  was primarily the result of the investment of the net proceeds of the company s stock offerings and net earnings 
provision for income taxes 
during fiscal  the company received product acceptance from its initial customer and commenced profitable operations  at which time the company reversed its previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal of million is net of a tax benefit of approximately million related to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the company s provision for income taxes was of pre tax earnings  or million for fiscal and was of pre tax earnings  or million for fiscal the increase in the tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of charges for purchased research and development expenses recorded in fiscal and an adjustment to the estimated prior year state income tax liability associated with alta operations 
purchase research and development charges are not deductible for tax purposes 
exclusive of the effect of these charges  the company s provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in fiscal the decrease in tax rate  exclusive of the above charges  for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a lower combined effective state income tax expense  a larger benefit from the company s foreign sales corporation and an increase in expected credits derived from research and development activities offset by an increase in non deductible goodwill amortization expense

the company s quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
the company s detailed discussion of risk factors addresses the many factors that have caused such variation in the past  and may cause similar variations in the future 
see risk factors 
in addition to those factors  in fiscal  the distraction attendant to the aborted tellabs merger had a significant  though difficult to quantify impact on the company s operations in the third and fourth quarter 
but apart from the distraction factor  the company believes the single most significant trend affecting the company s financial performance is the material effect of very aggressive price discounting by competitors seeking to acquire market share in the increasingly important market for high capacity solutions 
the company chose in the face of this pressure to continue to build market share in fiscal at the cost of declining margins 
the company intends to continue this strategy in order to preserve and enhance its market leadership and eventually build on its installed base with new and additional products 
pursuit of this strategy  in conjunction with increased investments in selling  marketing  and customer service activities  will likely limit the company s operating profitability over at least the first half of fiscal  and may result in near term operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company financed its operations and capital expenditures from inception through fiscal principally through the sale of convertible preferred stock for proceeds totaling million and capital lease financing totaling million 
the company completed its initial public offering of common stock in february and realized net proceeds of approximately million with an additional million received from the exercise of certain outstanding warrants 
in july  the company completed a public offering of common stock and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
during fiscal and fiscal the company also realized approximately million and million in tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and certain stock warrants  respectively 
as of october   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in corporate debt securities with contractual maturities of six months or less 
the company s operating activities used cash of million in fiscal  and provided cash of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the cash used in operations in fiscal was accounted for primarily by the company s research and development activities relating to its early development of the multiwave system 
cash provided by operations in fiscal and was principally attributable to net income adjusted for the non cash charges of depreciation  amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and warranty  increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income tax payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to increased revenue and to the general increase in business activity 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
included in investment activities were capital equipment expenditures in fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital equipment expenditures were primarily for test  manufacturing and computer equipment 
the company expects additional capital equipment expenditures of approximately million to be made during fiscal to support selling and marketing  manufacturing and product development activities 
in addition  since its inception the company s investing activities have included the use of million for the construction of leasehold improvements and the company expects to use an additional million of capital during fiscal in the construction of leasehold improvements for its facilities 
the company believes that its existing cash balance and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for at least the next to months 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 comprehensive income 
sfas no 
becomes effective for the company s fiscal year and requires reclassification of earlier financial statements for comparative purposes 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the amounts of certain items  including foreign currency translation adjustments and gains and losses on certain securities be shown in the financial statements 
sfas no 
does not require a specific format for the financial statement in which comprehensive income is reported  but does require that an amount representing total comprehensive income be reported in that statement 
the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement will change the way public companies report information about segments of their business in annual financial statements and requires them to report selected segment information in their quarterly reports issued to stockholders 
it also requires entity wide disclosures about the products and services an entity provides  the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues  and its major customers 
the statement is effective for the company s fiscal year the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending october  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
year readiness many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  accordingly  affected hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company s operations make use of a variety of computer equipment and software 
if the computer equipment and software used in the operation of the company do not correctly recognize data information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of work required  if any  to make its systems  products and infrastructure year compliant 
based on internal testing performed to date and completed by the company  the company currently believes and warrants to its customers that its products are year compliant 
however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving interaction of the company s products with third party products  the company may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
the impact of customer claims  if broader than anticipated  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company is currently in the process of conducting a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of both information technology it or software systems and non it systems used to run its systems 
non it systems typically include embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
examples of the company s non it systems include certain equipment used for production  research  testing and measurement processes and calibration 
as of december the company had assessed approximately of the it and non it systems used in its operations with an insignificant amount of those systems having been identified as year non compliant 
the company has begun the process of upgrading or replacing those identified non compliant systems with completion expected during fiscal for the year non compliance systems identified to date  the cost of remediation is not considered to be material to the company s financial condition or operating results 
however  if implementation of replacement systems is delayed  or if significant new noncompliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the company changed its main financial  manufacturing and information system to a company wide year compliant enterprise resource planning erp computer based system during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company estimates that it has spent approximately million on its erp implementation and estimates that it will likely spend  to  to address identified year issues 
the company expects that it will use cash from operations for year remediation and replacement costs 
approximately less than of the information technology budget is expected to be used for remediation 
no other information technology projects have been deferred due to the year efforts 
to date  the company has not yet employed an independent verification and validation process to assure the reliability of its risk and cost estimates 
the company is also in the process of contacting its critical suppliers to determine that suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
to date  the company s optical suppliers have represented that they are year compliant or are in the process of becoming compliant by december  if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they provide to the company  this could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears the company or its key suppliers will not be year compliant  and such noncompliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
risk factors competition 
the company believes the rapid pace at which the need for higher and more cost effective bandwidth has developed was not widely anticipated in the global telecommunications industry a factor which enabled the company to achieve early product and market leadership in the dwdm field 
more than two years after its initial shipments in  the company continues to believe its multiwave and multiwave sentry and systems are the only widely deployed and operational full channel and channel open architecture dwdm systems anywhere in the world  and further believes the demonstrated commercial manufacturability of its multiwave sentry system gives the company s high capacity product offerings a level of credibility not possessed by its competitors 
however  competition in the global telecommunications industry historically has been dominated by a small number of very large companies  each of which have greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater manufacturing capacity  broader product lines and more extensive and established customer relationships with network operators than the company 
lucent  alcatel  nortel  nec  pirelli  siemens  ericsson  fujitsu  and hitachi most of which provide a full complement of switches  fiberoptic transmission terminals and fiberoptic signal regenerators in addition to dwdm equipment  are examples of this type of company 
many of them have substantial economic interests in continuing sales of the legacy equipment which has dominated the historical network architecture designed for voice traffic  those interests are best served by containing the pace at which paradigm shifting new technologies are adopted  such as dwdm over new voice data architectures 
at the same time  these companies must participate in new technology markets or face potentially significant loss of account control and market share in the overall telecommunications equipment marketplace 
new market entrants like ciena  which appear to be achieving rapid and widespread market acceptance of new equipment  can represent a specific threat to these established companies 
as a result  the company expects and has observed aggressive competitive moves from many of these industry participants  which have to date included early announcement of competing or alternative products  substantial and increasing price discounting  customer financing assistance  packaged  one stop shopping deals combining dwdm equipment with other network equipment and supplies  and other tactics 
early announcements of competing products can and does cause confusion and delay in customer purchasing decisions  particularly if the announcements are viewed as credible in terms of both the performance of the announced product  and the time within which it will be available 
for example  lucent announced in january a proposed high capacity dwdm system which it claimed would handle gb s of capacity per fiber  and which it further claimed would be commercially available worldwide in the fourth quarter of the company believed at the time of the announcement that the lucent system would not be commercially available worldwide in the fourth quarter of and continues to believe so  however  the company did compete during against the promise of this product 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not make similar announcements of competing products in the future  with adverse impacts on customer purchasing decisions 
further  if new competing products are in fact developed  perform as advertised  and are manufacturable in volume quantities in the near future  the likelihood of significant orders for the company s multiwave systems may diminish 
the timing of shipments by the company and corresponding revenue  if delayed by reason of deferred deployment of multiwave systems pending evaluation of a competitor s product  could and likely would cause substantial swings  and potentially material and adverse effects  on the company s quarterly financial condition and results of operations 
while competition in general is broadly based on varying combinations of price  manufacturing capacity  timely delivery  system reliability  service commitment and installed customer base  as well as on the comprehensiveness of the system solution in meeting immediate network needs and foreseeable scaleability requirements  the company s customers are themselves under increasing competitive pressure to deliver bandwidth to their customers at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in pricing for dwdm systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions  which may favor larger competitors which can spread the effect of price discounts in their dwdm product lines across an array of products and services  and a customer base  which are larger than the company s 
the company s customers generally prefer to have at least two sources for key network equipment such as dwdm systems  but the company believes it has until recently been the only supplier of channel  or greater than channel  open architecture dwdm systems 
as competitors catch up with manufacturable dwdm systems which are realistic alternatives to those supplied by the company  the company s customers may reduce the portion of their dwdm purchases allocated to the company 
sprint has for several quarters indicated it intends to establish a second vendor for dwdm equipment 
although the company recently negotiated a contract with sprint which conferred preferred vendor status on the company through  the timing of sprint s selection of a second vendor  and the impact a selection might have on relative purchasing from the company and the second vendor  are decisions which are not under the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that these decisions will not result in a reduction in future purchasing from the company  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property disputes may also be asserted as part of a competitive effort to reduce the company s leadership position and limit its ability to achieve greater market share  even if the merits of specific disputes are doubtful 
some of the company s competitors are also key suppliers of components for the company s systems  and could harm the company through delay  interruption or other failures to supply the company with appropriate quality items 
see competitors as suppliers 
while the company will consider all appropriate means to position itself to compete successfully  including taking legal action where the tactics of competitors are believed to be unlawful  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with its larger competitors or that aggressive competitive moves faced by the company will not result in lost sales  significantly lower prices for the company s products  additional decreases in gross profit margins  and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has also observed an increase in the funding of new companies intending to develop new products for the rapidly evolving telecom industry 
the business and product plans for these companies are not always publicly known  but they may provide additional competition as to the company s existing product lines as well as potential future products 
concentration of potential customers  dependence on major customers 
the company s business  and particularly the size of its revenue growth potential  has historically been dependent on two customers  sprint and mciworldcom 
while the scope of commercial applications of the company s multiwave firefly and multiwave metro product scheduled for general commercial availability in the first calendar quarter of and is expected to expand the number of potential customers for the company  in the near term  additional potential customers  consisting almost exclusively of long distance and other telecommunications carriers using fiberoptic networks  are relatively few in number  and of those  a very small number have revenue potential comparable to that of sprint and mci worldcom 
the absence of at t as a potential customer heightens the risks to ciena inherent in having a relatively small number of customers  additionally  the company expects sprint s purchases in fiscal to be focused primarily on filling out installed systems with additional channel cards  and therefore substantially below the purchasing volume in either of the last two fiscal years 
the company s visibility into mciworldcom s purchasing plans for is at present very limited 
the number of potential major customers may also decrease if and as customers merge with or acquire one another 
in may  sbc and ameritech announced an agreement to merge  in july  bell atlantic and gte announced an agreement to merge 
the distraction and or reorganization sometimes attendant to such mergers could delay  limit or otherwise adversely affect the capital equipment purchasing patterns of the parties to them  with a corresponding adverse effect on the company s sales  even if the customer is otherwise satisfied with or interested in the company s products 
the extent to which the negative publicity relating to the company and its terminated merger agreement with tellabs will impact the company s ability to develop additional customers  or obtain additional orders from existing customers  in the near term is difficult to predict  there can be no assurance that there will be no adverse effect 
if the negative publicity has the effect of causing customers to delay or reduce purchases from the company  the adverse effect could be material 
additionally  the size and complexity of the company s potential customers  and the typically long and unpredictable sales cycles associated with them  require the company to make considerable early investments in account management personnel  product customization efforts in both engineering and manufacturing  and in some cases  facilities in proximity to the customer s locations  without assurance of future revenues 
the company invested considerable financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources in positioning the at t relationship to be successful  even though the company had no assurance as to the volume  duration or timing of any purchases which might ensue from at t 
the ongoing leveraging of these resources into other customer opportunities will need to be completed promptly and efficiently in order to minimize their impact on near term results of operations  and there is no assurance the company will successfully do so 
the company also intends to invest in developing significant customer relationships with bell atlantic and other rbocs and clecs  as well as internationally 
over the near term  this investment of resources has been evident in increased operating expenses and in a rise in the company s manufacturing and general overhead structure  with the result that the company may experience operating losses  even if revenues were to increase 
if the company is unable to convert these investments into significant revenue generating relationships  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
impacts of changes in customer mix 
with the company s equipment now widely deployed in the sprint network  with mciworldcom beginning to resume purchasing but at modest levels  and without at t as a potential customer  the company s sales efforts are focused on a greater number of smaller opportunities 
the company believes the pace of bandwidth demand is strong enough to create a number of smaller opportunities sufficient to support revenue growth over the long term 
however  the smaller opportunities often represent new carriers working aggressively to establish saleable new capacity 
these new carriers face a number of problems which the established carriers do not  specifically  they must attempt to balance the need to build their own customer base  acquire all necessary rights of way and interconnections necessary for saleable network service  and build out new capacity sufficient to meet anticipated needs  all while working within capital budget constraints 
these aspects of newer carriers tend to make them even less predictable as to either timing or volume of purchasing than the established carriers  in turn  this tends to exacerbate the problem of limited visibility which the company has regularly struggled with in conducting sales forecasting  materials and manufacturing planning  and in providing guidance to analysts as part of investor relations activities 
see stock price volatility 
unless and until the company s customer base broadens over the next several quarters  the likelihood of unanticipated changes in customer purchasing plans which could adversely impact the company s results relative to investor expectations is higher than it has been in the past 
most of the company s anticipated revenue over the next several quarters is comprised of less than million orders from each of several customers 
slips in timing of purchases  or changes in the amount of purchases at any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and relative to investor expectations 
see stock price volatility 
anticipating demand for bandwidth 
the company s systems enable high capacity transmission over long distance  and with the introduction of multiwave firefly and multiwave metro  certain short haul portions of  optical communications networks  however  the company s customers and target customers determine how much capacity is required  when it will be deployed  and what equipment configurations will be used  if any 
the company has encountered a wide variety of customer views of how much capacity will be needed over what periods of time  as well as how to convert such capacity into revenue 
those views reflect the customers differing competitive strategies and financial and marketing resources  and result in widely varying patterns and timing of evaluation  purchase and deployment of the company s systems  other dwdm systems or other capacity solutions 
certain carriers believe the deployment of large scale capacity quickly is a competitive advantage ie  they believe the accelerating demand for bandwidth will continue and the added capacity will be utilized quickly 
this viewpoint leads to prompt and widespread deployment of high channel count dwdm systems 
other carriers have adopted more of a wait and see approach  which dictates a more gradual channel by channel deployment of higher capacity systems 
new carrier entrants sometimes try to combine these viewpoints  favoring rapid and widespread installation of the foundational elements of high capacity systems  while opting for pricing and other supply agreement features which allow for deferral of channel purchases until the need is demonstrated 
these views are further influenced by the pace at which the higher bandwidth available over long distance routes is distributed or distributable over the last mile of the networks  as well as the willingness of carriers to aggressively lower their charges for services as a means of accelerating consumption of the higher bandwidth 
all of these views are also subject to abrupt change  as competition and the evolving marketplace may demand 
as an example  worldcom informed the company in february that its dwdm system requirements for would be substantially below the previous year s purchases of million 
worldcom indicated to the company that in it had purchased dwdm systems from the company at a level that contemplated two years of capacity requirements  and that s purchases would be substantially reduced 
worldcom s information in february demonstrated that there can be surprises as network operators and their purchasing groups grapple with unprecedented changes and challenges to network planning 
as a further example of the impact of the evolving marketplace  during fiscal the company shipped equipment to and recognized revenue from several new customers attempting to build out new networks under circumstances where the company had not even identified these customer opportunities as of a year prior to shipment 
under these circumstances  for so long as the company remains dependent on few customers  the company will be vulnerable to significant quarterly fluctuations  and to difficulty in predicting the direction or magnitude of future demand for the company s systems 
the company believes growth in data communications and in commercial and consumer use of the internet remains solid as a market driver of demand for bandwidth  which in turn fuels demand for dwdm systems and other high bandwidth solutions 
the company also is confident that its products are well targeted toward the visible emerging chokepoints in the networks 
the company is less certain whether it will be able to accurately anticipate changes in direction or magnitude of near term demand 
unanticipated reductions in demand would adversely affect the company s profitability and  depending on the size of the gap between actual  reduced demand  and investor expectation of such demand  could result in further stock price volatility irrespective of the company s overall competitive position and long term prospects 
customer capital equipment spending and the economy 
in addition to the risks associated with assessing the core demand for bandwidth and its impact on individual customer purchasing decisions  broader concerns about the condition of the world and us economy can have a generic dampening effect on the kind of large scale commitments to capital equipment acquisition on which the company s business depends 
established carriers may delay or reduce capital equipment acquisition during times of economic uncertainty 
new competitive carriers may be less likely to delay or reduce capital equipment acquisition because their ability to generate revenue depends on the prompt deployment of service providing equipment 
but if the new competitive carrier is not adequately financed  economic uncertainty can limit its access to new financing sources and cause a delay in capital equipment purchasing 
if current economic conditions deteriorate sufficiently to negatively impact the purchasing decisions of established or new carriers  or both  the company s business will be adversely affected 
deteriorating economic conditions may also result in demands for vendor supplied financing  particularly among less well financed new carriers 
the company s larger competitors may be able to provide more attractive financing than can the company  which may give them a competitive advantage over the company in this segment of the market 
additionally  the pricing and gross margin pressures experienced by the company as a result of competition could be magnified if deflationary expectations become broadly embedded in the world economy 
new product development delays 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology  industry standards  customer requirements and product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely fashion relative to customer expectations of increasingly short product development cycles  will be significant factors in the company s ability to remain a market leader in the deployment of dwdm systems and in the optical communications market generally 
the complexity of the technology involved in product development efforts in the dwdm field  including product customization efforts for individual customers  can result in unanticipated delays 
the qualification and ramping up of new suppliers for new or customized products requires extensive planning and can result in unanticipated delays which affect the company s ability to deliver such products in a timely fashion 
the software certification process for new telecom equipment used in rboc networks a process traditionally conducted by bellcore on behalf of the rbocs can also result in unanticipated delays  and has resulted in some delay in the commercial introduction of multiwave sentry and firefly for the rboc market 
the failure to deliver new and improved products  or appropriately customized products  in a timely fashion relative to customer expectations which can be influenced by competitors announcements of competing products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and financial condition 
see competition 
the company has made a general commitment to the commercial availability of multiwave metro within the next several months 
the company s performance on this commitment relative to customer expectations will likely have a material impact on the company s ability to further solidify its position in the communications industry as a credible  long term supplier of multiple products and successive next generation solutions 
the company believes it will be successful in this effort  but there is no assurance of that  and there will likely be few objective leading indicators of the company s success or failure  other than purchasing by its customers 
recent product introduction 
the multiwave has been operational and carrying live traffic for approximately two years  the multiwave sentry and multiwave sentry for less than a year  and the multiwave firefly is just now being introduced into the field 
the in service reliability of the company s equipment has to date substantially exceeded statistical standards predicted for equipment of this kind 
however  the introduction of new fiberoptic systems with high technology content is likely to involve occasional problems as the technology and manufacturing methods mature  and the company s experience has been consistent with this expectation 
further  the company s history of installation activity indicates that the newness and high precision nature of dwdm equipment may require enhanced customer training and installation support from the company 
the company is aware of instances domestically and internationally in which installation and activation of certain multiwave systems have been delayed due to faulty components found in certain portions of these systems 
the company is aware of few performance issues once the systems are installed and operational 
however  if recurring or material reliability  quality or network monitoring problems should develop  a number of material and adverse effects could result  including manufacturing rework costs  high service and warranty expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers and declining level of interest from potential customers 
although the company maintains accruals for product warranties  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed these amounts 
the pace at which the customer requires upgrades from to to higher channel count systems occurs which in some cases can involve replacement of portions of the existing equipment can further complicate the assessment of appropriate product warranty reserves 
the company expects there will be interruptions or delays from time to time in the activation of the systems and the addition of channels  particularly because the company does not control all aspects of the installation and activation activities 
the company believes its record to date of problem identification  diagnosis and resolution has been good  but if significant interruptions or delays occur  or if their cause is not promptly identified  diagnosed and resolved  confidence in the multiwave systems could be undermined 
an undermining of confidence in the multiwave systems would have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships  business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuation in quarterly and annual results 
the company s revenue and operating results have varied and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year as a result of a number of factors  including the size and timing of orders  product mix and shipments of systems 
the timing of order placement  size of orders  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria  as well as order delays or deferrals and shipment delays and deferrals  have caused and may continue to cause material fluctuations in revenue 
see competition and impacts of changes in customer mix 
delays or deferrals in purchasing decisions may increase as competitors introduce new competing products  customers change purchasing practices  and as the company develops and introduces new dwdm products or moves to next generation versions of existing products  such as the multiwave sentry  multiwave sentry  multiwave firefly and multiwave metro 
consolidation among the company s customers and target customers  such as that involved in the worldcom mci merger  and the distraction and or reorganization attendant to such consolidation which may continue well after consummation may also lead to delay or deferral of purchasing decisions 
the company believes its present limited visibility into mciworldcom s purchasing plan is in part a reflection of this phenomenon 
see concentration of potential customers  dependence on major customers 
changes in customers approaches to bandwidth deployment can also materially impact purchasing decisions 
see anticipating demand for bandwidth 
the ongoing shift in the company s customer mix also affects the likelihood of fluctuating results  as do general economic conditions 
see impacts of changes in customer mix  customer capital equipment spending and the economy 
the company s dependence on a small number of existing and potential customers increases the revenue impact of each customer s actions relative to these factors 
the company s expense levels in the future will be partially based on its expectations of long term future revenue and as a result net income for any quarterly period in which material orders are shipped or delayed or not forthcoming could vary significantly 
the company s expense levels for the next two quarters to some extent reflect the substantial investment in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources already incurred in order to position the at t  rboc  international and other potential commercial relationships to be successful  even though at t has now removed ciena from further consideration as a dwdm vendor  and there is no assurance as to the volume  duration or timing of any purchases which might ensue from others 
see concentration of potential customers  dependence on major customers 
over the near term  this investment of resources has been evident in increased inventory levels and operating expenses  and in a rise in the company s manufacturing and general overhead and expense structure  with the result that the company s near term results of operations may be only modestly profitable or may involve operating losses  even if revenues sequentially increase 
in general  quarter to quarter sequential revenue and operating results over the next months are likely to fluctuate and therefore may not be reliable indicators of annual performance 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success has always depended in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  particularly those skilled and experienced with optical communications equipment 
the company believes its heritage as an entrepreneurial startup has been an important factor in its success to date in attracting and retaining key personnel 
however  competition for such personnel is intense and often increases when a company becomes party to a merger  as various recruiters look for key personnel interested in leaving 
the terminated merger with tellabs  and the attendant publicity and media speculation regarding its outcome and impact on the company  have intensified competitors efforts to entice employees to leave the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain all of its key contributors or attract new personnel to add to or replace them 
failure to retain the company s key personnel  and to attract new personnel likely would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
legal proceedings 
see part ii  legal proceedings for disclosure concerning recent shareholder class action lawsuits filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors 
the company believes the lawsuits are without merit and is defending itself vigorously 
however  because the lawsuits are at an early stage  it is not possible to predict the outcome at this time  and there is no assurance that the outcome would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
competitors as suppliers 
certain of the company s component suppliers are both primary sources for such components and major competitors in the market for system equipment 
for example  the company buys certain key components from lucent  alcatel  nortel  nec and siemens  each of which offers optical communications systems and equipment which are competitive with the company s multiwave systems 
lucent is the sole source of two integrated circuits and is one of two suppliers of erbium doped fiber 
alcatel and nortel are suppliers of lasers used in multiwave systems 
nec is a supplier of certain testing equipment 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these supply relationships were to decline in reliability or otherwise change in any manner adverse to the company 
the company to date has not experienced to date any general decline in reliability among these vendors  but the intensifying competition described above makes this risk factor increasingly important 
long and unpredictable sales cycles 
the purchase of network equipment such as dwdm equipment is typically carried out by network operators pursuant to multiyear purchasing programs which may increase or decrease annually as the operators adjust their capital equipment budgets and purchasing priorities 
the company s customers do not typically share detailed information on the duration or magnitude of planned purchasing programs  nor do they consistently provide to the company advance notice of contemplated changes in their capital equipment budgets and purchasing priorities 
such changes may occur due to factors unique to the individual customer or in response to general economic conditions 
see customer capital equipment spending and the economy 
additionally  to the extent that the company s customers follow budgeting cycles which generally correspond to the calendar year  the company may experience a slow down in demand toward the calendar year end 
further  the company is experiencing a shift in its customer mix which may add to the length and unpredictable nature of the sales cycle 
see impacts of changes in customer mix 
these uncertainties substantially complicate the company s manufacturing planning  and may lead to substantial and unanticipated fluctuations in the timing of orders and revenue 
the company has in fact experienced such unanticipated fluctuations in prior quarters  but until the third fiscal quarter of  any unanticipated reduction in orders from one customer had been offset in part or in whole by unanticipated increases in orders for other routes with the same customer or in orders from another customer 
there can be no assurance of the company s ability to offset such reductions in the future 
any curtailment or termination of customer purchasing programs  decreases in customer capital budgets or reduction in the purchasing priority assigned to equipment such as dwdm equipment  particularly if significant and unanticipated by the company and not offset by increased purchasing from other customers  could have a material adverse effect on the predictability of the company s business  and on its financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is the case with most manufacturing companies  the company has manufactured  and likely will continue to manufacture a portion of its finished products on the basis of non binding customer forecasts rather than actual purchase orders 
however  in contrast to most manufacturing companies  given the company s dependence on very few customers  and the relatively high cost of the company s dwdm systems  the financial consequences of mismatches between what is built and what is actually ordered can be magnified 
customers may also encounter delays in their build out of new routes or in their installation of new equipment in existing routes  with the result that orders for the multiwave systems may be delayed or deferred 
any such delay with any major customer  as well as any other delay  deferral or unanticipated change in the configuration of orders for multiwave systems  could result in material fluctuations in the timing of orders and revenue  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock price volatility 
the company s common stock price has experienced substantial price volatility  and is likely to continue to do so 
such volatility can arise as a result of the activities of short sellers and risk arbitrageurs  and may have little relationship to the company s financial results or prospects 
volatility can also arise as a result of any divergence between the company s actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by the company  as occurred in the fiscal year just ended 
the company attempts to address this possible divergence through its public announcements and reports  however  the degree of specificity the company can offer in such announcements  and the likelihood that any forward looking statements made by the company will prove correct in actual results  can and will vary  due primarily to the uncertainties associated with the company s dependence on a small number of existing and potential customers  the impacts of changes in the customer mix  the actions of competitors  long and unpredictable sales cycles and customer purchasing programs  the absence of unconditional minimum purchase commitments from any customer  a lack of visibility into its customers deployment plans over the course of the capital equipment procurement year  and the lack of reliable data on which to anticipate core demand for high bandwidth transmission capacity 
an example of this uncertainty is evidenced in the february communication from worldcom that its dwdm system requirements for would be substantially reduced relative to last year s purchases  due to a change in its purchasing policies 
see concentration of potential customers  dependence on major customers 
a further example of this uncertainty occurred the third fiscal quarter  as an order expected to be million or more from a customer was unexpectedly delayed late in the quarter 
this delayed order now appears likely to be withheld as the result of new commitments by the customer to purchase dwdm equipment from a competitor 
see competition and impacts of changes in customer mix 
the worldcom example in fiscal  and the example of the third fiscal quarter indicate that divergence between the company s actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of stock analysts can occur notwithstanding the company s efforts to address those expectations through public announcements and reports 
such divergence will likely occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of the company s overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
for so long as the company remains highly dependent on few customers  and particularly in years  like the just completed fiscal year  when substantial majority of purchases by these customers are likely to be focused on products  such as multiwave sentry and  and multiwave firefly  being introduced for the first time  there is substantial risk of widely varying quarterly results  including the so called missed quarter relative to investor expectations which do not account for these issues  with attendant risk of higher volatility in the company s stock price 
see concentration of potential customers  dependence on major customers  and anticipating demand for bandwidth 
technological change and new products 
the company expects that new technologies will emerge  and existing technologies will rapidly evolve  as competition in the telecommunications industry increases and the need for higher and more cost efficient bandwidth expands 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology  industry standards  customer requirements and product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products will be significant factors in the company s ability to remain the leader in the deployment of open architecture dwdm systems and other high capacity solutions 
there is no assurance of the company s ability to successfully do so 
the market for telecommunications equipment is characterized by substantial capital investment and diverse and competing technologies such as fiberoptic  cable  wireless and satellite technologies 
the accelerating pace of deregulation in the telecommunications industry will likely intensify the competition for improved technology 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and manufacturing capacity with which to develop or acquire new technologies and generally to compete for market acceptance of their products 
the introduction of new products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint  obsolete or unmarketable 
any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers 
suppliers in the specialized  high technology sector of the optical communications industry are generally not as plentiful or  in some case  as reliable  as suppliers in more mature industries 
the company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for key components of its multiwave systems as well as equipment used to manufacture the multiwave systems 
multiwave systems collectively utilize approximately  components  and certain key optical and electronic components are currently available only from a sole source 
while alternative suppliers have been identified for certain key optical and electronic components  not all of those alternative sources have been qualified by the company 
the company has to date conducted most of its business with suppliers through the issuance of conventional purchase orders against the company s forecasted requirements 
the company also pursues long term supply agreements with some key suppliers  but a large majority of its business with vendors continues to be done without such agreements 
the company has from time to time experienced minor delays in the receipt of key components  and any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of them could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency discount notes with an average maturity of less than six months 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union is scheduled to take place in the company s fiscal year the company has not determined what impact  if any  the euro will have on foreign exchange exposure 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of october  the assets and liabilities of the company related to nondollar denominated currencies was not material
