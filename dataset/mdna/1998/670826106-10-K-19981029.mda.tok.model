future outlook in july  william r 
barker was appointed to the newly created executive position of president of the automotive safety products division 
he is responsible for all aspects of the company s inflator and initiator business worldwide 
under mr 
barker s direction  oea s automotive safety products division is focusing on a four phase approach to growth 
the first step is to aggressively attack the cost structure and reduce operating costs in all areas 
this will be essential to offset the weighted average inflator price reduction that became effective august  the second step is to obtain new business for oea s current products 
initial new business awards were announced in september totaling million inflators and million on an annualized basis 
with this new business  the utilization of oea s new  square foot inflator production facility is expected to increase from in the fiscal fourth quarter to in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the third step is to aggressively market new technology such as dual stage smart inflators and micro gas generators for use in seat belt pretensioner systems 
oea s dual stage smart inflator was the first in the industry to receive preliminary approval from general motors 
the fourth step is to identify other commercially viable pyrotechnic products for automotive or other applications 
initial progress on this step is believed to be approximately one year away 
the company will also opportunistically analyze potential strategic acquisitions for oea s automotive safety products division  on a case by case basis 
results of operations fiscal year vs 
net sales net sales for fiscal year were million  as compared to fiscal net sales of million 
the million increase from the prior year reflects a sales increase in both the automotive and nonautomotive segments of the company s business 
automotive segment sales increased million to million in fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in inflator sales million units in fiscal  as compared to million units in fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in initiator sales 
the increased inflator sales reflect continued strong customer acceptance of the company s inflator program and increased demand for air bags from both domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers 
the reduced initiator sales resulted from a temporary one year reduction in demand from a major customer 
management believes initiator volumes will return to expected levels in the coming year as this customer has agreed to significantly increase its commitments for fiscal see settlement of legal claim below for further detail 
nonautomotive segment sales increased million to million in fiscal primarily due to increases in engineering development contracts and the delta satellite launcher program 
management expects continued increases in automotive unit sales in fiscal year  with modest dollar sales increases as a result of price decreases on its current initiator and inflator products 
cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal year was million  as compared to fiscal cost of sales of million 
automotive segment cost of sales was million in fiscal  as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase primarily reflects increased inflator volume  partially offset by reduced initiator volume  a parts shortage resulting in periodic production shut downs on the company s passenger inflator lines  the impact of the general motors strike  increased overhead and other costs associated with the company s new inflator production facility  which was only running at a utilization level by the fiscal fourth quarter  and million in one time charges see one time charges below 
additionally  automotive segment cost of sales was impacted by the adoption of the aicpa s statement of position  reporting the costs of start up activities 
this resulted in expensing previously capitalized inflator start up costs of million in fiscal  partially offset by the reversal of capitalized start up amortization expense in the amount of million 
refer to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle below for further detail on statement of position nonautomotive segment cost of sales was million in fiscal  as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase primarily reflects increased sales  testing and replacement costs relating to a tlx energy transfer line performance issue and million in one time charges see one time charges below 
the cause of the tlx performance problem was quickly identified and corrected and product shipments have resumed 
gross margin gross margin was million of net sales for fiscal  as compared to million of net sales for fiscal automotive segment gross margin was million of net automotive sales for fiscal  as compared to million of net automotive sales for fiscal this decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the increased inflator costs as discussed above  lower leverage of fixed initiator costs due to reduced volume  adoption of the aicpa s statement of position relating to start up costs and million in one time charges see one time charges below 
excluding the adoption of sop and the one time charges  automotive segment gross margin would have been million of net sales for fiscal management expects that automotive gross margin will be tight in the first half of fiscal as a result of price decreases  but that cost reductions undertaken in recent months will take effect and begin to be reflected in improved gross margins in the second half of the fiscal year 
nonautomotive segment gross margin was million of net nonautomotive sales for fiscal  as compared to million of net nonautomotive sales for fiscal excluding the million one time charge  nonautomotive segment gross margins would have been million of net sales for fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million of net sales  as compared to million of net sales  for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a million one time charge related to the settlement of a legal claim see one time charges below and to costs of establishing an infrastructure to service the european inflator market at the company s french subsidiary  pyroindustrie 
excluding the one time charge  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been for fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for both fiscal year and fiscal year research and development costs are expected to increase significantly in fiscal year as the company continues to develop and refine new products such as dual stage inflators used in smart air bags  micro gas generators used in seat belt pretensioner systems  and other advanced inflators 
operating profit loss the company experienced a million operating loss for fiscal year of net sales  as compared to an operating profit of million of net sales for fiscal year excluding the adoption of sop and the one time charges  operating profit would have been million of net sales for fiscal year other income and expense total other income expense was an million expense for fiscal year  as compared to million of income in the prior year 
fiscal includes a million one time charge for the disposal of idle and obsolete automotive segment equipment see one time charges below  while fiscal includes million in income for the sale of the company s foreign joint venture  pyrospace sa the remaining difference is primarily due to interest expense  which was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal interest costs have increased due to the company s higher debt level and the significant reduction in capitalized interest in fiscal the company made substantial capital asset acquisitions ie  building and equipment in fiscal for which related interest costs were capitalized 
these assets were placed in service by fiscal  therefore  interest costs were expensed  not capitalized in fiscal cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in april  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
this statement requires entities to expense costs of start up activities as they are incurred and to report the initial adoption as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
start up activities are defined broadly as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  initiating a new process in an existing facility  or commencing some new operation 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  however  in july the company elected to adopt it retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  the fiscal quarterly financial statements have been restated to expense start up costs in the net amount of million for the twelve months ended july  see cost of sales above 
additionally  the company wrote off in the first quarter the net book value million of its start up and related costs included in the scope of sop as a one time adjustment referred to as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the total after tax amount of these adjustments was million for fiscal year net earnings loss the company recorded a million net loss for fiscal year of net sales  as compared to net earnings of million of net sales for fiscal year basic earnings loss per share was 
for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal excluding the adoption of sop and the one time charges  net earnings would have been million and basic earnings per share would have been 
for fiscal year one time charges the company recognized one time charges in fiscal of million  net of taxes  or 
per share 
explanations of the more significant charges are detailed below 
inventory adjustments 
the company booked inventory adjustments totaling million million after tax in the fiscal third quarter primarily related to the start up of its new inflator production lines 
these adjustments resulted from a combination of the rapid expansion of the inflator program  including significant additions in personnel  and system conversion issues associated with the implementation of a new  fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system for the company s automotive operations 
the company has completely re implemented the erp system and has brought in consultants to review the system set up and procedures  and to re train all employees 
management believes that this problem is resolved  however  physical inventories will be taken each quarter end until it is fully demonstrated that the system is functioning properly 
disposal of inflators 
the company disposed of early production inflators from its new facility for a total cost of million million after tax in the fiscal third quarter  which includes both production and disposal costs 
this resulted from an unusual quality issue that affected one in ten thousand units 
however  due to the unusual nature of the problem  the actual units affected could not be identified 
the company s automotive products are propellant actuated  life saving devices and only the highest level of quality is acceptable 
therefore  all potentially affected units approximately  inflators were disposed of to ensure that they would not be installed in air bag modules or automobiles 
corrective action  which management believes will prevent any future occurrences  was implemented immediately and has been approved by the company s customers 
production and customer shipments have resumed 
domestic initiator consolidation 
the company incurred costs totaling million million after tax in the fiscal third quarter related to the consolidation of its domestic initiator production operations into its utah facility 
these costs consist of million for equipment and personnel relocation and a million charge for idled and or obsolete equipment and inventory 
this consolidation is expected to generate significant annual cost savings  while maintaining the company s domestic initiator capacity of million units 
additionally  the company s french facility has a capacity of million units  which supplies the european market and serves as a back up to its domestic production 
settlement of legal claim 
in consideration of new business and improving relations  the company settled a lawsuit with a major initiator customer 
this resulted in a fiscal third quarter charge of million million after tax for trade receivables and obsolete inventory 
in return  the customer committed to significantly higher initiator purchases in fiscal this resolution is an important milestone toward improving the company s relationship with this customer and should benefit both its initiator and inflator operations 
inflator equipment obsolescence 
the company wrote off million million after tax of low volume inflator production equipment in the fiscal third quarter 
this equipment was originally purchased to support customers requirements by bridging the gap between prototype production and high volume production 
with the company s new high volume inflator production lines becoming fully operational  this low volume production equipment has become idled and obsolete 
aerospace inventory obsolescence 
as the company s aerospace business shifts from traditional defense government business to commercial business satellites and satellite launch vehicles  a more stringent obsolescence approach is required 
the new approach was adopted during the fiscal third quarter and resulted in a charge of million million after tax 
fiscal year vs 
net sales and operating profits for the fiscal year ended july   were million and million  respectively  compared to fiscal net sales of million and operating profits of million 
net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal year were million and  respectively  compared to fiscal net earnings of million and earnings per share of 
consolidated gross margin did  however  decrease from in fiscal year to in fiscal this principally reflected a major shift in product mix in the automotive segment 
in fiscal year  initiator sales represented of total automotive segment sales  while they represented only of total automotive segment sales in fiscal this shift was directly related to the company s increased inflator sales 
initiators represent a more mature  higher margin product line  whereas inflators were in the early production and start up stages of the products life cycles 
the three new major product lines that moved from the start up stage to the early production stage in fiscal were the driver side inflator  the side impact inflator  and the second generation passenger side inflator 
initial mass production of these inflators began late in the fourth quarter of fiscal the automotive safety products division was the primary contributor to the sales and operating profit increases over fiscal year automotive sales and operating profit increased and  respectively  due primarily to increased volume 
nonautomotive sales increased  however  operating profit decreased as a result of investments in new programs 
total operating profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal year was  compared to for fiscal research and development expenditures decreased million to million in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal this was the result of the company completing the development of its driver side  side impact  and second generation passenger side inflators and shifting its resources to product launch 
start up costs of million related to the product launches of the company s new single stage hybrid inflators were capitalized in fiscal these costs were amortized on a straight line basis over a period not exceeding five years 
pyrospace sa  the company s foreign joint venture  was merged with another french aerospace company  pyromeca sa  effective december   creating a new entity  pyroalliance sa oea sold its ownership share of the original pyrospace to snpe sa owner of pyromeca for million french francs approximately million and a ownership in pyroalliance 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is reflected in other income 
also included in other income in fiscal is a million royalty payment from daicel chemical industries  ltd 
this was the third annual payment under a fifteen year agreement for the transfer of technology and manufacture of oea s single stage hybrid inflators for passenger  driver and side impact automotive air bags for manufacture in asia for the asian market 
fiscal year other income included a million payment under the same agreement 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital decreased million during the year to million at july  from million at july  the company made capital expenditures totaling million in fiscal  which were funded from bank borrowings and internally generated funds 
on april   the company entered into a four year  million amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a group of seven banks 
this agreement was amended on june  the company s principal bank is acting as agent for this agreement 
the interest rate applicable margin plus federal funds or libor is progressive and based upon the company s ratio of indebtedness to ebitda 
the margin will fluctuate up or down as determined by the above ratio 
at july   the applicable interest rate was 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants including tangible net worth  indebtedness to ebitda  indebtedness to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage 
the company has  from time to time  failed to meet individual financial covenants  however  it has successfully negotiated a temporary waiver or amendment to the agreement in each such instance 
at the company s discretion  it may convert all or part of the total debt to eurodollar or alternate base rate loan s 
this credit facility expires on december   and provides for two twelve month extensions to the termination date 
at july   the company had million of long term debt drawn down on this credit facility 
anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and facility expansions are expected to be met through bank borrowings and from internally generated funds 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to maintain traceability  process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on current assessments  the company is progressing with its modification and replacement of significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with its modifications to existing software and conversions of new software  the year issue will be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to modify  replace  and test its software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year project by july to date  the company has incurred approximately million related to the assessment of  and efforts in connection with  its year project 
approximately of which are capitalized costs related to the purchase and implementation of new computer software and hardware 
the total remaining costs for this project are currently being assessed and are unknown at this time
