major implementation efforts are scheduled to occur at the end of second quarter the company presently believes that year issues will not pose significant operational problems for the company s new it systems  as implemented 
however  the year issue may have a material impact on the operations of the company in the event the company s new it systems are not implemented as planned 
in addition  the company is currently evaluating its product and service offerings to determine whether any modifications will be necessary to ensure year functionality 
at this time  the company is unable to quantify the cost of any such modifications or other activities required to address the year issue and therefore is unable to determine if such costs and expenses will be material to the company

forward looking statements the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to future goals of the company  including statements contained in this report  the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s reports to shareholders 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  believe or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those presently anticipated or projected 
the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
among the factors that could cause the company s actual results in the future to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods are the following the company s ability to establish a new brand and identity 
prior to the distribution  the transferred businesses had the benefit of certain m trademarks and m s reputation in marketing their products 
pursuant to agreements entered into with m  the company continues to have the use of certain m trademarks for an agreed upon period of time following the distribution 
the company s right to use certain m trademarks such as the scotch tm trademark expires on june   while the right to use other m trademarks expires on june  the company has made and continues to make significant investments in the development of the company s identity and brand 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard or that the loss of use of m trademarks might not have an adverse effect on the business of the company 
competitive industry conditions 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s competitors are both larger and smaller than the company in terms of resources and market shares 
the marketplaces in which the company operates are generally characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolution to digital business solutions  and declining prices in certain product lines 
in these highly competitive markets  the company s success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products and customer solutions successfully on a timely basis 
the success of the company s offerings is dependent on several factors including understanding customer needs  strong digital technology  differentiation from competitive offerings  market acceptance and lower costs 
although the company believes that it can take the necessary steps to meet the competitive challenges of these marketplaces  no assurance can be given with regard to the company s ability to take these steps  the actions of competitors  some of which will have greater resources than the company  or the pace of technological changes 
changing technologies 
the information processing industry is undergoing rapid technological change 
as there is a greatly expanding need to manage and store more complex information in less time  with less resources and with greater accuracy  there is an increasing emphasis in the marketplace on solutions using digital technologies 
in particular  the data storage market is characterized by short product development cycles that are driven by rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences as well as declining product prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to introduce new proprietary products  that the market will be receptive to its new products or that the company s competitors will not introduce more advanced products ahead of the company 
in addition  while the company currently has access to significant proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties  there can be no assurance that it will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new growth products in the markets served by the company 
in addition  new technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability 
therefore  the company must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the technologies in which the company desires to invest 
if the company is not successful in continuing to introduce new proprietary products in growth segments of the markets served by the company  the company may incur a material adverse impact on its business and financial results 
the company s ability to establish independent it systems and business processes 
the company is making significant investments in establishing the company s information technology it infrastructure and in re engineering the company s business processes 
prior to the distribution  these and other corporate services were provided to the transferred businesses by m 
for a transition period following the distribution  m has continued to provide such services to the company 
see item business relationship between m and the company corporate services transition agreement 
during this transitional period the company must establish its own services and support systems independent of m 
the company presently intends to implement a major portion of its new it systems at the end of the second quarter of and is performing extensive testing on the new systems to detect any errors in the systems 
however  as with all major it system installations  there are a number of risks associated with implementation 
if the company is not able to implement the it systems as planned or if the company incurs delays or problems in the implementation  or if the installation results in lost data that is critical to the company s operations  the additional costs associated with such events may have a material adverse impact on the company s business and financial results 
international operations and foreign currency 
the company does business in more than countries outside the united states 
international operations  which comprised approximately of the company s revenues in  may be subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations  including political instability  the possibility of expropriation  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  local government involvement required for operational changes within the company  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
in addition  the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign currency hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  however  these risk management activities are not comprehensive and there can be no assurance that these programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
intellectual property rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and protect its intellectual property rights and to defend itself against intellectual property infringement claims of others 
if the company is not successful in defending itself against claims that may arise from time to time alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  the company could incur substantial costs in implementing remediation actions  such as redesigning its products or processes or acquiring license rights 
such costs or the disruption to the company s operations occasioned by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company utilizes valuable non patented technical know how and trade secrets in its product development and manufacturing operations 
although the company utilizes confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect such proprietary information  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached or that competitors of the company will not acquire the information as a result of such breaches or through independent development 
the company has pursued a policy of aggressively enforcing its intellectual property rights against others who may infringe those rights 
in connection with such enforcement actions  the company may incur significant costs for which the company may or may not be reimbursed by the alleged infringer 
net losses for  and  restructuring charges 
the company began operations as an independent public company on july  and therefore does not have a lengthy operating history as an independent company 
the company reported net losses of million in  million in and million in these results include restructuring charges and other special charges totaling million in  million in and million in excluding these charges  the company would have reported net income of million in  million in and million in see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
while the company s recently announced restructuring plans are designed to reduce the company s cost structure and improve its profitability  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving its financial improvement goals in the future 
in addition  although the company has no current plans to do so  if it becomes necessary for the company to shut down or restructure additional businesses and operations in the future  it could incur substantial  additional charges in the process 
the recording of these charges could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
fluctuations in the company s stock price 
the company s stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
future capital requirements 
in connection with the distribution  the company entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under this facility 
as a result of the restructuring and other special charges recorded by the company in its consolidated financial statements  the company is not currently in compliance with certain of its financial covenants contained in its credit agreement 
the company has obtained waivers for compliance with those covenants from its lenders through january  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity 
the company expects to enter into a new credit facility prior to january  and believes that it will be able to obtain a credit facility of a size and with financial covenants acceptable to the company 
however  the terms of the new credit facility  including the financial covenants contained therein  may affect the company s sources and cost of capital
