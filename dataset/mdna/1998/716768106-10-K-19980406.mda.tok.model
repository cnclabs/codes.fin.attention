item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled purchasing and distribution  competition  and risk factors included in this form k for the year ended february  overview petsmart is the largest operator of superstores specializing in pet food  supplies and services in north america and the united kingdom 
at february   the company operated superstores  consisting of superstores in the united states  superstores in the united kingdom  and superstores in canada 
petsmart s store base has grown rapidly since the company s inception in through the opening of new stores and through the acquisitions of petzazz in march  petstuff in june  pet food giant in september  and pet city in december the company also acquired two leading catalog retailers  sporting dog in may and state line tack in january all of these transactions were accounted for as poolings of interest 
earnings per share are presented in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
the company expects that future increases in net sales and net income  if any  will be dependent on the opening of additional superstores and the improved performance of new and existing superstores 
in view of the increasing maturity of its superstore base  as well as the planned opening of additional superstores in existing markets and single store markets  the company anticipates that its comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of its expansion plans  the company anticipates the timing of new superstore openings  and related preopening expenses  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing superstores may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
the company has achieved less favorable operating results in certain north american geographic regions it recently entered than it has achieved historically in other regions 
in addition  because new superstores have higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature superstores  the impact of new superstore openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
the company charges preopening costs associated with each new superstore to earnings when the superstore is opened 
therefore  the company expects that the opening of large numbers of new superstores in a given quarter will adversely impact its quarterly results of operations for that period 
see risk factors performance of superstores and quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
developments during fiscal for the first half of fiscal  the company reported disappointing operating results due to a combination of reduced inventory levels  which led to out of stock conditions in certain key categories  and lost sales momentum as a result of a departure from the company s historically more effective advertising programs 
in june  samuel j 
parker  the company s chairman  resumed his former role as chief executive officer and began the implementation of a series of back to basics initiatives intended to refocus the company and to improve financial performance 
see business the petsmart strategy back to basics 
in connection with the implementation of these initiatives and other considerations  petsmart recorded restructuring expenses and a charge for merger and business integration costs aggregating million before tax benefits in the second quarter of fiscal  of which approximately million represented a cash charge 
these charges consisted of million in restructuring expenses related to the closure and relocation of certain stores  the elimination of certain departments within petsmart superstores  and additional costs associated with certain of the company s prior acquisitions  and million of other one time charges which were recorded as components of cost of goods sold  store operating expenses and general and administrative expenses 
the million of other one time expenses in the second quarter of fiscal were comprised of the write down or write off of certain discontinued merchandise and impaired assets  reserves for litigation and other matters 
of these expenses  the million that was reflected as a component of cost of goods sold included the writedown of the discovery center inventory from cost to net realizable value in connection with the discontinuance of that department  as well as the writedown of certain non discovery center inventory from cost to net realizable value as a result of the decision to exit other product categories 
as a consequence of its back to basics initiatives and to better focus its merchandise selections on pet related products  the company determined that its discovery center merchandise  consisting primarily of educational and human oriented items  should be discontinued 
given the square footage and store location devoted to this area  combined with the lower turnover and sell through gross margin  management believed the store area would be better utilized with different merchandise 
the million of other expenses reflected as a component of store operating expenses and the million of one time expenses reflected as general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a change in estimated self insurance costs due to adverse loss developments in the company s worker s compensation experience  expenses related to the preliminary stages of a consulting project for the new management information system  certain costs of several litigation matters  as well as expenses related to other miscellaneous matters 
of the million in restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  approximately million was related to the costs of closing or relocating stores  of which were former petzazz  petstuff or pet food giant stores  approximately million was related to the costs of discontinuing the discovery center department in all superstores and the write down or write off of related fixtures and approximately million was related to the company s previous acquisitions 
the remaining charges of million included approximately million of anticipated costs associated with the company s decision to complete the consolidation of the ennis  texas distribution center into the company s new phoenix  arizona facility and approximately million representing the write off of the company s investments in certain other entities accounted for under the cost method  which were impaired as a result of the company s decision to exit certain departments within the petsmart superstores 
as a result of the acquisition of pet city  the company recorded charges for merger and business integration costs of million during fiscal  primarily related to reformatting  refixturing  and remerchandising the acquired stores to the petsmart superstore format and other costs of integration 
the majority of these expenses related to an advertising program to promote the new store image and format 
the company also recorded charges of approximately million for merger and business integration costs during second quarter as a result of additional real estate costs incurred in connection with certain of its previous acquisitions 
the activity within the accrued merger and restructuring costs liability account is summarized below in thousands balance at payments balance at feb 
 additional asset feb 
 expenses write offs professional fees  accrued severance    lease termination real estate costs     accrued business integration costs    store conversion costs    in november   of subordinated convertible notes the notes were issued by the company and sold to qualified institutional buyers as defined in rule a of the securities act in transactions exempt from registration under the securities act  and in sales outside the united states within the meaning of regulation s under the securities act 
the net proceeds to petsmart from the sale of the notes were approximately  the lost sales and earnings momentum experienced in the first half of continued to negatively affect results of operations and comparable store sales throughout fiscal specifically  comparable store sales increases for the north american stores approximated for the second half of fiscal  well below the company s historical and anticipated levels  and gross margins remained below historical norms due to the mix of merchandise sales  increased occupancy and warehouse and distribution costs  higher personnel costs in service areas of the business  and the effects of the company s return to the every day low pricing policy 
store operating expenses also increased during the second half of fiscal due to the increased emphasis on customer service which required increased payroll expenditures  and general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the activities related to the company s management information systems project 
the company does not anticipate these costs to decrease significantly  if at all  during fiscal the company believes that during the second half of fiscal  the operational matters which precipitated the reduced inventory levels  out of stock conditions and lost sales momentum were addressed and that significant progress is being made to prevent a recurrence of these issues 
specifically  the company s comparable transaction counts continue to increase  inventory levels and in stock positions are believed to be more balanced  the company s cash and working capital positions are adequate to fund future growth and projects for the next fiscal year  and the company believes that the increased emphasis on customer service is having positive results in store morale and customer responsiveness 
there can be no assurance that these recent trends and favorable developments will continue or that the company will not experience other operational issues which have a material adverse impact upon results of operations during fiscal additionally  the company s planned schedule of new store openings in fiscal is heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year and therefore  cash requirements  along with the associated preopening expenses and inventory needs  will be significant and may negatively impact results of operations during such period

cash and cash equivalents were million 
cash used in operations was million for fiscal compared to cash used in operations of million for the prior year 
approximately million of the net cash used in operations during fiscal related to the timing of inventory purchases on account and payment of those accounts 
merchandise accounts payable leveraging the percentage of merchandise inventory financed by vendor credit terms  eg  accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory  decreased to at february   compared to at february  primarily as a result of the company taking advantage of cash discounts and the timing of purchasing activities 
inventory balances were approximately million at february   and million at february  average north american store inventory  which excludes the inventory of petsmart direct  decreased to  per store at february   from approximately  at february   due to management s efforts to improve inventory turns 
as part of the company s efforts to reduce the carrying value of north american superstore inventories  certain actions were taken which caused a severe and sudden decrease in inventory purchasing activities during the first quarter of fiscal as a consequence  store deliveries of certain key merchandise were temporarily interrupted and resulted in out of stock conditions in several key merchandise categories and locations 
as a result  certain merchandise was not available for customer purchase during the later half of the first quarter and the first half of the second fiscal quarter of inventory balances  in the aggregate  increased slightly over the second half of fiscal and are anticipated to increase moderately during fiscal this inventory increase is anticipated to occur as a consequence of the inventory purchasing requirements resulting from the company s current plan to open approximately new north american superstores in fiscal cash used in operations was offset by million resulting from the recording in second quarter of the non cash portion of the accrued merger and restructuring costs 
future cash uses for restructuring costs will be partially offset by cash inflows from the liquidation of inventory and the related tax benefits associated with the discontinuation of certain departments within all superstores and the closing of certain superstores 
the company estimates an approximate million to million aggregate positive net cash flow from the restructuring activities over the next two years 
the company has used cash in investing activities since inception to purchase leaseholds  fixtures and equipment and computer software in support of its administrative functions

the company estimates that the cash requirements after lease financing to open each new us prototype superstore  including store fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  preopening costs and inventory is approximately  this amount will include an average of approximately  for leasehold improvements an average of approximately  if the superstore site is a rehabilitated unit  approximately  for preopening costs  and approximately  for inventory  net of accounts payable 
approximately  is required for store fixtures and equipment  which is typically fully funded through lease financing 
petsmart is in the initial phases of developing and implementing an integrated worldwide information system which will feature a common set of applications 
the company estimates that its costs in connection with the development and implementation of the new system in north america  before giving consideration to any lease financing that may be available  will be up to million annually through fiscal the company believes that certain hardware and software components of the new system may be financed through lease transactions  although there can be no assurance that the actual costs for the new system will not exceed current estimates 
there can be no assurance that the new system can be developed  tested and implemented on a timely basis  or at all  or that it will deliver the anticipated operational benefits in a reliable manner 
failure to complete the new system  or to complete the new system on a timely basis  could materially adversely affect the company s future operating results or its ability to expand 
in particular  should the new system not be operational  or should an alternate solution not be implemented  by january   the company may experience software difficulties as a result of the so called year problem 
the company is currently assessing the extent of the year impact on its suppliers and other vendors 
in the event that additional financing is required to complete the company s new information system  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms

management believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under the credit facility and available lease financing will provide adequate funds for the company s foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
the company s ability to fund its operations and to make planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  to refinance indebtedness and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
see risk factors 
seasonality and inflation the company s business is subject to some seasonal fluctuation and it typically realizes a higher portion of its net sales and operating profits during the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products and services designed to address pet health needs  such as flea and tick problems  have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the introduction of alternative treatments  as well as by variations in weather conditions 
in addition  because petsmart s superstores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions 
the company s results of operations and financial position are presented based upon historical cost 
although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation is likely to have a material adverse effect on its net sales or results of operations
