item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with sci s financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
the statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which sci operates  management s beliefs  and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
future factors include i changes in general economic conditions in its target markets that could adversely affect demand for sci s properties and the creditworthiness of sci s customers  ii changes in financial markets and interest rates that could adversely affect sci s cost of capital and its ability to meet its financial needs and obligations  iii increased or unanticipated competition for distribution properties in sci s target markets  and iv those factors discussed below 
these are representative of the future factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
overview general sci s operating results depend primarily upon net operating income from distribution properties  which is substantially influenced by i the demand for and supply of distribution properties in sci s target market cities  ii the pace and economic returns at which sci can acquire and develop additional distribution properties  iii the extent to which sci can sustain improved market performance as measured by lease rates and occupancy and iv the operating performance of sci s unconsolidated subsidiaries see results of operations income from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
no assurance can be given that expected trends for the remainder of in leasing rates and economic returns on acquired and developed properties will be realized 
there are risks associated with sci s development and acquisition activities which include future factors such as development and acquisition opportunities explored by sci may be abandoned  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other expenses  and construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
acquisition activities entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that analysis with respect to the cost of improvements to bring an acquired project up to standards will prove inaccurate  as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
although sci undertakes a thorough evaluation of the physical condition of each proposed investment before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after it is acquired  which could increase sci s total acquisition cost 
risks include the occurrence of any of the events described above that could adversely affect sci s ability to achieve its projected returns on acquisitions and projects under development and could hinder sci s ability to make expected distributions 
sci s target market cities and submarkets have benefited substantially in recent periods from demographic trends including population and job growth which influence the demand for distribution properties 
sci believes its ability to compete is significantly enhanced relative to other companies because of its depth of management and ability to serve customers through the sci international operating system tm  which includes acquisition  development  and property management personnel  and presence in local markets 
sci expanded its operations into mexico and europe in the first half of to meet the needs of its targeted national and international customers as they expand and reconfigure their distribution facility requirements globally 
with six target market cities identified in mexico and identified in europe  sci believes that there are significant growth opportunities internationally 
as a result of acquisitions and developments of distribution properties for the twelve months of  sci s rentable square footage of operating properties increased by million square feet or to million square feet as of december  from million square feet as of december  sci frequently acquires distribution properties that are underleased  and develops such properties  which are not fully leased at the start of construction  which reduces sci s overall occupancy rate below its stabilized level but provides opportunities to increase revenues 
the term stabilized means that capital improvements  repositioning  new management and new marketing programs or development and marketing  in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time but in no case longer than months for properties acquired by sci and months after shell completion for properties developed by sci to achieve stabilized occupancy typically  but ranging from to  depending on the submarket and product type at market rents 
sci has been successful in increasing occupancies on acquired and developed properties during their initial months of operations resulting in an occupancy rate of and a leased rate of for stabilized properties owned as of december  the average increase in rental rates for new and renewed leases on previously leased space million square feet during was 
as leases are renewed or new leases are acquired  sci expects most lease rates on renewals or new leases to increase in these factors should improve sci s results of operations 
capital and credit market conditions which affect sci s cost of equity and debt capital may influence future growth in operating results 
consummation of merger transaction on september   sci terminated its reit management agreement with the reit manager and its property management agreement with the property manager collectively the management companies  pursuant to the merger whereby sci acquired the operations and businesses of the management companies valued at approximately million from security capital in exchange for  common shares 
the number of common shares issued to security capital was determined using a per common share price of the average market price of common shares over the five day period prior to the august  record date for determining sci s shareholders entitled to vote on the merger 
the board of trustees approved the merger transaction based on the recommendation of a special committee comprised of independent trustees 
the merger  which required the approval of a majority of sci s outstanding common shares  was approved by approximately of the shareholders voting on the transaction on september  as a result of the transaction  sci became an internally managed reit and security capital remains sci s largest shareholder ownership based on outstanding common shares as of december  and on a diluted basis assuming conversion of series b preferred shares and limited partnership units and the exercise of options and warrants 
the financial impact of the merger is discussed in more detail below under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
sci has undertaken a review of all of its computer systems and applications to determine if these programs are year compliant and if not  the efforts that will be necessary to bring the programs into compliance 
sci has not identified any computer system or application that  upon failure to be year compliant  would have a material adverse impact on its business activities or results of operations 
however  the preliminary results of this review indicate that some of sci s accounting and financial reporting applications are not year compliant 
for purposes of enhancing operating efficiencies  sci has already undertaken a project that will replace its core financial systems with computer software that will better serve sci in the future 
this new software  that is expected to be fully operational by the end of  is year compliant 
sci is currently evaluating any necessary modifications to other existing software programs such that the programs will function properly with respect to dates in the year the cost of these modifications is not expected to be material and all conversions and modifications are expected to be completed in a timely manner

from inception through december   sci invested billion for the acquisition and development of  operating distribution properties and had invested million in refrigerated warehousing through its subsidiary  sci logistics 
these acquisitions and developments were financed with cash on hand  the issuance of limited partnership units  the assumption of existing mortgage debt and borrowings under sci s line of credit which were repaid with the proceeds of sci s equity and debt offerings 
at december   sci had million of budgeted development cost for developments in process  of which million was unfunded 
sci expects to finance construction  development and acquisitions primarily with cash on hand  borrowings under its line of credit  and cash from future securities offerings 
when issuing debt  sci intends primarily to arrange  fixed rate  year to year debt to finance additional acquisitions and developments 
to a lesser extent  under certain circumstances  sci may arrange for debt with different maturities in order to optimize its debt maturity schedule 
sci considers its liquidity and ability to generate cash from operations and financings to be adequate and expects it to continue to be adequate to meet sci s acquisition  development  operating  debt service and shareholder distribution requirements 
sci s current distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders based upon what the board and management consider to be a reasonable percentage of cash flow 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  quarterly distributions will consistently be higher than quarterly earnings 
pursuant to the terms of the series a preferred shares  the series b preferred shares and the series c preferred shares the preferred shares  sci is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to the common shares unless all cumulative distributions with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for distributions that have been declared for the then current distribution period with respect to the preferred shares

on january   sci adopted the nareit revised definition of funds from operations 
under this more conservative definition  loan cost amortization is not added back to net earnings in determining funds from operations 
the funds from operations measure presented by sci  while consistent with the nareit definition  will not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits which do not compute funds from operations in a manner consistent with sci 
funds from operations are not intended to represent cash made available to shareholders
