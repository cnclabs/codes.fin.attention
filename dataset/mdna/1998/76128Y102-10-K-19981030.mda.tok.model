the company has completed the awareness phase of its project

the company has taken steps to monitor the progress made by those parties  and intends to test critical system interfaces  as the year approaches 
the company will develop appropriate contingency plans in the event that a significant exposure is identified relative to the dependencies on third party systems 
while the company is not presently aware of any such significant exposure  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to properly convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company
