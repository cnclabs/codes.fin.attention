as a result  the managed care industry  which includes health maintenance organization hmo  preferred provider organization ppo and prepaid health service plans  has grown substantially 
while the trend toward managed care solutions has traditionally been pursued most aggressively by the private sector  the public sector has recently embraced the trend in an effort to control the costs of health care provided to medicaid recipients 
consequently  many states are promoting managed care initiatives to contain these rising costs and supporting programs that encourage or mandate medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans

managed plans owned by the company omnicare tn 
omnicare tn was organized as a tennessee corporation in october  and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the company was active in the development of omnicare tn and  through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc ua tn  owns a equity interest in omnicare tn  a local partner owns the remaining 
omnicare tn began as a ppo contractor in tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured recipients  and operated as a full risk prepaid health services plan until it obtained its tenncare hmo license in march omnicare tn s tenncare hmo contract was executed in october  retroactive to the date of licensure 
in november  omnicare tn contracted with tenncare as a ppo  to arrange for the financing and delivery of health care services on a capitated basis to medicaid eligibles and the working uninsured and uninsurable non medicaid individuals who lack access to private or employer sponsored health insurance or to another government health plan 
the tenncare bureau placed an indefinite moratorium on working uninsured enrollment in december  however  such action did not affect persons enrolled in a plan prior to the moratorium 
in april  enrollment was expanded to include the children of the working uninsured up to age the annually renewable tenncare contract was renewed on july  for an additional month term 
consistent with past contract renewals  plan management expects an approximate increase in premium rates 
omnicare tn currently serves shelby and davidson counties in tennessee which include the cities of memphis and nashville 
as of september   total enrollment was approximately  members  of which  and  represent medicaid and non medicaid enrollees  respectively 
a day open enrollment change period for all tenncare eligibles occurs once a year in october 
plan management expects a net increase in enrollment in fiscal resulting from the change in individuals medicaid eligibility status and net enrollment gains during the open enrollment period 
the plan s application for a commercial hmo license is pending 
plan management has been in frequent communication with the state to eliminate any further processing delays of the application and expects the issuance of the license in the third quarter of fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the license will be issued within this time period 
management believes that the receipt of the commercial license and the plan s efforts to expand its provider network to the southwestern area of tennessee would enable omnicare tn to increase its enrollment by marketing its managed care products to the various employer groups in the regions served 
ultramedix 
ultramedix  a network model hmo headquartered in tampa  florida  was founded as a florida corporation in may through its majority owned subsidiary  united american of florida  inc ua fl  the company owns of ultramedix  with the remaining owned by local shareholders 
the march  court order  described below  placed ultramedix and ua fl in liquidation 
as of december   ultramedix was not in compliance with the florida department of insurance fdoi statutory solvency requirement 
the fdoi requires that hmos maintain a statutory reserve as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices of 
million 
ultramedix s statutory deficiency at december  was estimated at million 
as a result  on january   the company  ultramedix and the plan s third party administrator  ua fl  signed and delivered to the fdoi a stipulation and consent to appointment of receiver and order of liquidation entitling fdoi to obtain the entry of an accompanying consent order by the applicable florida court if the company did not cure ultramedix s existing statutory reserve deficiency estimated at million by february  on february   the deficiency had not been cured and pursuant to the fdoi s petition  the florida court entered such consent order 
pursuant to the stipulation and consent order ultramedix and ua fl the organizations admitted that ultramedix was statutorily insolvent as of december   the company paid 
million to the fdoi to cover ultramedix claims incurred during and provider capitation payments due for the eight days ended february   and funded the organizations ordinary business expenses for the same period  the fdoi took control of the organizations bank accounts  the plan ceased enrolling new members  and the organizations continued to provide services to all of the plan s subscribers and to process renewals on all policies as they came due 
pursuant to the consent order  on february   the organizations were declared insolvent and the fdoi was appointed as receiver for the purposes of their liquidation 
on march   the florida court entered a consent order of liquidation  injunction and notice of stay  declaring that any further efforts of the receiver to rehabilitate the organizations would be useless  ordering the fdoi  as receiver  to take possession of and liquidate all assets of the organizations and ordering the immediate cancellation of ultramedix s authority to provide health services as an hmo in florida 
on april   the florida agency for health care administration notified the company of the agency s intent to enforce the company s guarantee agreement  under which the company had agreed to reimburse ultramedix s contracted medicaid providers for authorized  covered medicaid services rendered to covered medicaid enrollees  for which the agency had made payment on behalf of such enrollees  limited to an amount equal to the amount of surplus ultramedix would have been required to maintain under the medicaid contract in the absence of such guarantee agreement 
although the outcome cannot be predicted or reasonably estimated  company management expects that the ultimate resolution regarding the guarantee agreement will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
managed plan operated by the company omnicare mi 
omnicare mi is a not for profit  tax exempt corporation headquartered in detroit  michigan and serving southeastern michigan  operating in wayne  oakland  macomb  monroe and washtenaw counties 
its history includes a number of innovations that were adopted and proved successful for the industry 
it was the first network model hmo in the country and the first to capitate physician services in an ipa model hmo 
omnicare mi also created and implemented the first known mental health carve out in omnicare mi enrollment is through companies that offer the plan to employees and their family members  through individual enrollment that is open once a year for a day period  and through the state s medicaid program pursuant to an agreement with the michigan department of community health  which makes hmo coverage available to eligibles in certain counties and mandatory in others 
this annually renewable agreement was extended by mutual agreement for an additional twelve months from january  to december  as of september   total enrollment in omnicare mi was approximately  of which  represent commercial members  including approximately  point of service members and approximately  represent medicaid members 
among the major employers that offer omnicare mi  ranked by enrollment  are the city of detroit  the federal government  the detroit board of education  ford motor company  the state of michigan  general motors corporation  chrysler corporation  detroit edison  wayne county and comerica bank  the largest of which represents approximately of omnicare mi s total enrollment 
no other group exceeds of the plan s total enrollment 
hmo growth in the state of michigan has remained fairly static over the last several years 
hmo enrollment penetration has remained in the range during that period 
however  management believes that this dormancy will not continue as public acceptance of hmos is growing and employer encouragement is increasing as they realize that hmos cost less and provide quality care 
the state of michigan  in an effort to reduce the cost of its medicaid program  competitively bid its medicaid contracts  with an effective date of july the affected southeastern michigan counties include a significant portion of the plan s medicaid enrollment 
in may  omnicare mi was notified that it had been selected to participate in the state s program 
unsuccessful bidders to the state s request for proposal legally challenged the initiative and  as a result  the state did not assign the medicaid eligibles to plans that were awarded contracts  but nonetheless instituted the rate reduction component of the new program effective july with the indefinite delay of the assignment of approximately  eligible recipients to the selected plans  and the implementation of the rate reductions of  the operating revenues of omnicare mi and the resulting management fee revenues to the company were adversely affected in fiscal there can be no assurance that omnicare mi can control health care costs at the rate of the premium reductions 
newspaper stories in may reported that the michigan insurance bureau the bureau had obtained a sealed confidential court order on may  giving state regulators control over omnicare mi s assets 
the company responded with a public statement on may   stating that omnicare mi was not in receivership but was in active discussion with the bureau regarding compliance with certain regulatory issues  that all services to members of omnicare mi would continue to be provided  with no decrease in the quality of care  and all providers would continue to be paid for their services  and that both the company and omnicare mi had completely restructured their top management 
in june  the company funded a million unsecured loan to omnicare mi  evidenced by a surplus note  to enable omnicare mi to meet its minimum requirements for net worth and working capital 
pursuant to the surplus note  interest and principal repayments are subject to approval by the bureau and are payable only out of the statutory surplus earnings of omnicare mi 
the interest rate is at prime  payable annually and if not paid is forfeited 
the principal has no stated maturity or repayment date 
the surplus note is subordinated to all other claimants of omnicare mi 
the company recorded an impairment loss against its investment in this surplus note based on its evaluation of the recoverable value of such investment and accordingly  recognized bad debt expense of million for the year ended june  on july   the bureau issued a public statement in which the michigan commissioner of insurance announced reaching accord with omnicare mi on a four month plan to revitalize the hmo and cited three major positive developments respecting omnicare an unsecured loan of million by the company  the corrective action plan and the experienced and capable leadership of gregory h 
moses 
the reduction of medicaid rates and other factors were considered in developing the omnicare mi corrective action plan  which is in the process of implementation 
the corrective action plan includes the reduction of medical costs through renegotiation of hospital provider contracts  reduction of pharmacy costs and a reduction in the management fee percentage paid to the company from to  effective june  in fiscal  the company derived of its total revenues from its management agreement with omnicare mi 
management believes that the continued viability of omnicare mi is critical to the company s future operations and concluded that the unsecured loan  in the form of a surplus note  and reduction in the management fee percentage were necessary actions to strengthen the financial condition and continued viability of omnicare mi 
the company  in its restructuring efforts and forecasts  has considered the impact of the reduction in the management fee percentage 
based on the fiscal level of operating revenues of omnicare mi  the pro forma impact of this reduction if applicable for all of that year would have been a reduction in management fee revenues of approximately million or 
earnings per share 
other managed plan ventures omnicare la 
omnicare la  a network model hmo headquartered in new orleans  louisiana  was organized as a louisiana corporation in november  and is owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of louisiana  inc ua la ua la 
the plan was granted an hmo license by the louisiana department of insurance in june in connection therewith  the company funded omnicare la s statutory reserve and net worth requirements through letters of credit for million and million in cash deposited in accounts at state banks in louisiana 
omnicare la was in a pre operational phase since inception 
consistent with the company s restructuring efforts  it has ceased its operations in louisiana and withdrawn its million statutory reserve and is in the process of liquidating and dissolving omnicare la  including the anticipated cancellation of its letter of credit commitments 
philcare 
philcare  a network model hmo headquartered in philadelphia  pennsylvania  was organized as a pennsylvania corporation in may philcare is owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of pennsylvania  inc ua pa  and owned by local participants 
in june  philcare obtained its hmo license  with the company funding philcare s statutory reserve and net worth requirements of million through cash deposited at a pennsylvania bank 
philcare s initial business plan was to participate in pennsylvania s mandatory medicaid pilot program  healthchoices  which required the enrollment of approximately  medicaid recipients in five metropolitan philadelphia counties into hmos 
in october  the company announced its decision to withdraw its support of philcare s participation in the healthchoices program because existing program requirements would have made the company s participation in the program unprofitable 
effective april   philcare entered into an integrated delivery system ids agreement with an entity that arranges for the provision of health care services for its medicaid membership through contracts with health care providers 
the ids agreement places the entity in the position of bearing the risk  but as the contractor with the pennsylvania department of public welfare  the state s regulatory agency for hmos  philcare is looked upon as being responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations 
in  the company recorded a full impairment loss against its investment in philcare based on its evaluation of the net recoverable value of such investment 
this resulted in bad debt expense of million for the year ended june  the company s board of directors has determined to pursue recouping its investment in philcare 
consistent with the company s restructuring efforts  the company has ceased all operational activities of ua pa  except its rent obligations for leased office space in philadelphia which has been substantially sublet and with respect to which the company continues to seek subtenants for the remaining space 
the company is currently negotiating with its landlord to assume the subleases and release the company from its lease obligations  but company management is unable to predict the outcome of such discussions 
advica health management 
in march  the company reached an agreement with new york based healthscope administrative services corporation  later known as healthscope united  inc healthscope  to form a health care management company intended to gain access to one of the largest medicaid eligible populations in the united states 
pursuant to the agreement  healthscope became a wholly owned subsidiary of advica health management formerly united healthscope  inc advica  which was organized to engage in development  consulting and contract management services for publicly funded managed care programs in the metropolitan new york area 
in  new york city officials announced a four year initiative to enroll over million medicaid recipients residing in new york city in managed care plans 
the staggered enrollment aspect of the program was necessitated by an insufficient capacity to enroll all such recipients 
this mandated initiative began to roll out in early advica management anticipated the phase in for its service areas in early  but as of september  the rollout to advica s service areas has not yet begun 
through may  outstanding amounts owed to the company from advica totaled approximately million 
in may  advica s outstanding debt and preferred stock were restructured to attract other investors 
the company converted its interest in advica  including advances  accrued interest and the value of warrants held by the company  to one million shares of non voting preferred stock of the restructured advica in the amount of million  and a warrant to purchase  shares of advica common stock  exercisable at any time at a nominal price  representing approximately of advica s common shares on a fully diluted basis 
the conversion of the company s loans to advica to preferred stock was treated as a troubled debt restructuring with the investment recorded at its estimated fair value at the date of the restructuring 
this resulted in bad debt expense of 
million for the year ended june  subsequently  based on advica s current and historical operating results as of june   the company recognized a full impairment loss on such investment that resulted in bad debt expense of million for fiscal year self funded benefit plans in  the company acquired chf for approximately million in the form of cash  stock  a contingent note and the assumption of liabilities 
the contingent note was for million and was earned out at both june  and june  chf designs customized employee welfare plan arrangements for self funded employers and provides marketing  management and administrative services to self funded employers generally 
management believed that its acquisition of chf represented an opportunity to expand its traditional business into the self funded market that comprises a majority of the private sector employers 
a self funded health benefit plan is one in which an employer directly assumes the financial risk for its employees health care costs by paying for employees medical claims out of a separate fund consisting of employee and or employer contributions 
on september   the company s board of directors approved the proposed stock sale of chf for million in cash to an entity related to the company by certain common shareholders contingent on the buyer securing financing 
the buyer was unable to obtain financing  resulting in the termination of the proposed sale 
subsequently  on may   the company s board of directors approved a new proposed stock sale of chf to a privately held national employee leasing company for million in net cash plus million of the proposed buyer s preferred stock  bearing a annual preferred dividend payable in stock for three years and  thereafter  a annual preferred dividend payable in cash 
this proposed transaction was also not consummated 
with the approval of the company s board of directors  the company reopened discussions with the principals of the first prospective buyer  including louis j 
nicholas  the chief executive officer of chf and a former officer and director of the company 
on august   the company s board of directors approved the terms of a new proposed chf stock sale 
pursuant thereto  on september   chfa  inc  a corporation owned by mr 
nicholas and others  purchased all of the stock of chf for million  comprised of million in cash  a secured note for million and an unsecured note for million 
a regional investment banking firm issued a fairness opinion supporting the reasonableness of the consideration to be received by the company for such sale 
the secured note is payable to the company in four monthly installments of 
million each on the last day of september through december with the balance due in january  with options to extend the final payment to march  plus interest at the prime rate on short term unsecured commercial borrowings 
the unsecured note is payable to the company in two annual installments of 
million with the balance due august  the security for the secured note includes a pledge of the stock of chf and a limited personal guarantee of mr 
nicholas 
the proceeds from the sale of chf have been and will be used to reduce debt and provide security for the company s bank indebtedness 
other venture and product choiceone 
in december  the company completed the stock sale of its wholly owned subsidiary  choiceone  a multi state ppo created in  for 
million in cash 
the sale resulted from the company s re evaluating its strategic objectives and determining that choiceone was not a core business segment 
while owned by the company  choiceone was compensated by receiving either a per member access fee or a percentage of the savings realized from accessing the choiceone network 
as of august   choiceone had approximately  members representing payors 
government regulation the company is subject to extensive federal and state health care and insurance regulations designed primarily to protect enrollees in the managed plans  particularly with respect to government sponsored enrollees 
such regulations govern many aspects of the company s business affairs and typically empower state agencies to review management agreements with health care plans for  among other things  reasonableness of charges 
among the other areas regulated by federal and state law are licensure requirements  premium rate increases  new product offerings  procedures for quality assurance  enrollment requirements  covered benefits  service area expansion  provider relationships and the financial condition of the managed plans  including cash reserve requirements and dividend restrictions 
there can be no assurances that the company or its managed plans will be granted the necessary approvals for new products or will maintain federal qualifications or state licensure 
the licensing and operation of omnicare mi  omnicare tn  ultramedix  philcare and omnicare la are governed by the respective states statutes and regulations applicable to health maintenance organizations 
the managed plans licenses are subject to denial  limitation  suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plans are operating out of compliance with the states hmo statutes  failing to provide quality health services  establishing rates that are unfair or unreasonable  failing to fulfill obligations under outstanding agreements or operating on an unsound fiscal basis 
except for omnicare mi  the plans are not federally qualified hmos and  therefore  are not subject to the federal hmo act 
federal and state regulation of health care plans and managed care products is subject to frequent change  varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and generally gives responsible administrative agencies broad discretion 
laws and regulations relating to the company s business are subject to amendment and or interpretation in each jurisdiction 
in particular  legislation mandating managed care for medicaid recipients is often subject to change and may not initially be accompanied by administrative rules and guidelines 
changes in federal or state governmental regulation could affect the company s operations  profitability and business prospects 
currently omnicare mi is in active discussions with state regulators regarding compliance with certain regulatory issues 
see managed plan operated by the company under managed plans above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
while the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future regulations may be interpreted  regulatory revisions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
insurance the company presently carries comprehensive general liability  directors and officers liability  property  business automobile  and workers compensation insurance 
management believes that coverage levels under these policies are adequate in view of the risks associated with the company s business 
the management agreements with omnicare mi and omnicare tn require  and with ultramedix required  the respective managed plans to maintain general liability insurance  naming the company as an additional insured 
the company or the individual managed plans are or were required to pay the insurance premiums under the terms of the respective management agreements 
in addition  the managed plans have professional liability insurance that covers liability claims arising from medical malpractice  with the company named as an additional insured 
there can be no assurance as to the future availability or cost of such insurance  or that the company s business risks will be maintained within the limits of such insurance coverage 
competition the managed care industry is highly competitive 
the company directly competes with other entities that provide health care plan management services  some of which are nonprofit corporations and others which have significantly greater financial and administrative resources 
the company primarily competes on the basis of fee arrangements  cost effectiveness and the range and quality of services offered to prospective health care clients 
while the company believes that its experience gives it certain competitive advantages over existing and potential new competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the future 
the company competes with other hmos  ppos and insurance companies 
the level of this competition may affect  among other things  the operating revenues of the managed plans and  therefore  the revenues of the company 
the predominant competitors in southeastern michigan are blue cross blue shield of michigan  the wellness plan  total health plan and health alliance plan 
the predominant competitors in central and southwestern tennessee are access med plus and blue cross blue shield 
the company s managed plans primarily compete on the basis of enrollee premiums  covered benefits  provider networks  utilization limitations  enrollee co payments and other related plan features and criteria 
management believes that the company s existing clients are able to compete effectively with their primary market competitors in these areas 
employees the company s ability to maintain its competitive position and expand its business into new markets depends  in significant part  upon the maintenance of its relationships with various existing senior officers  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified health care management professionals 
although the company has an employment agreement with its current chief executive officer  it neither has  nor intends to pursue employment agreements with all of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
consistent with the company s restructuring efforts  the total number of employees was reduced from at august  to at september  of this reduction in staff  approximately was due to the company s cessation of its operations in florida  pennsylvania and louisiana  and was attributable to a reduction in staffing  including attrition  of its corporate and tennessee operations 
management believes that the maintenance of the current staff with nominal projected increases will allow it to complete its restructuring efforts and stabilize operations in fiscal the company s employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit and management considers its relations with employees to be good 
management information systems management believes that timely and relevant information is critical to a managed care operation and utilizes its management information system mis to process claims  analyze health care utilization  support provider  member and employer requirements  and control administrative costs 
the company previously initiated an mis implementation plan intended to enhance its operations  reduce costs and improve customer service with the development of a proprietary client server information system  along with complementary automation products including claims scanning  claims imaging  electronic data interchange and various select technologies for enterprise wide installation 
the company experienced substantial changes in its mis personnel in recent months  and appointed a new senior director of management information systems in august management is currently reassessing its mis requirements and developing a comprehensive mis strategy for the company 
year the company is in the process of developing plans to address issues related to the potential impact of the year on its computerized systems and equipment 
the plans in development will address systems modification requirements in the following primary areas information systems  facilities  payors and suppliers 
while the financial impact of making the required systems changes has not yet been quantified  it is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company presently believes that with such modifications to software and hardware  which are expected to be completed by the end of  the year issue will not pose material problems 
however  if such modifications are not made or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
furthermore  the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and large payors to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues

the enrollment for omnicare tn was approximately  at june   compared to approximately  at june   a decrease of  members or 
the state of tennessee s disenrollment of approximately  members in the quarter ending december was the primary reason for the decrease

medical premiums for ultramedix increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net increase is due to months of activity in fiscal compared to months in fiscal ultramedix s enrollment at june  was approximately  an increase of  from the june  enrollment of approximately  members 
ultramedix made significant enrollment gains in the commercial market since approval of its hmo license in october the increase in the commercial market was due in part to the state of florida s unsuccessful initiative to mandate the enrollment of medicaid eligibles into managed care organizations 
ultramedix was selected to participate in this program and the contract award would have capped ultramedix s medicaid enrollment  including existing members  at approximately  during the contract period 
because of legal challenges from unsuccessful bidders to the state s request for proposal  the initiative was halted indefinitely 
to minimize the uncertainty related to rate reductions contemplated by the initiative  ultramedix retargeted its marketing efforts to expand its commercial business

million of the decrease was due to an agreement reached in june between the company and omnicare tn  pursuant to which omnicare tn agreed to reimburse the company approximately million for start up costs and other expenses incurred for the period january through september operating revenues of omnicare mi decreased in fiscal due primarily to a net decrease in enrollment rates of approximately  which resulted in decreased management fees to the company of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in management fees from ppc  attributable primarily to increased ppc enrollment of approximately  offset by a decrease in premium rates of approximately and months of management fees in fiscal compared to months in fiscal the company s management agreement with ppc was terminated pursuant to binding arbitration  effective may   based in part on a dispute between the parties with respect to the payment of non emergent transportation costs for enrollees as a marketing expense to be incurred under the management agreement 
omnicare mi was notified in may that it had been selected to participate in the state of michigan s initiative to mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care organizations 
similar to the initiative in florida  the state s initiative was legally challenged by unsuccessful bidders responding to the state s request for proposal 
because of these legal challenges  the state did not assign the medicaid eligibles to plans that were awarded contracts in the bid process  but did  however  institute the rate reduction component of this new program effective july total expenses before income taxes from continuing operations totaled million in  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
of the total medical service expenses of million in fiscal  million relates to omnicare tn and million to ultramedix  an increase of million over medical service expenses of million in fiscal the mlr was for omnicare tn and for ultramedix in fiscal the omnicare tn mlr for fiscal was positively affected by the state of tennessee s million settlement to adjust the amount of claims saving paid and or accrued to the state of tennessee prior to omnicare tn obtaining its tenncare hmo license and the recognition of duplicate claims paid to providers

million  from 
million in fiscal to zero in fiscal  due to the company s acquisition of a majority interest in omnicare tn and ultramedix in january depreciation and amortization in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
million 
the increase was due primarily to the amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions and computer software 
interest expense increased approximately 
million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to increased borrowings against the line of credit 
of the bad debt expense of million in fiscal  million relates to a valuation reserve established to estimate the net recovery of million in refundable advances made by omnicare tn to a third party administrator 
the third party administrator has denied the obligation and  as a result  the company is pursuing legal action to collect the receivable 
the balance of the fiscal bad debt expense is due to an additional write down of approximately 
million recorded to reduce the company s million investment in advica 
prior year advica reserves totaled million 
as the investment was capital in nature  no tax credits have been taken against the cumulative reserve of million 
the contract settlement expense recorded in december of million represented a one time adjustment to management fee revenues and its effect on other related accounts based on the provisions of the revised management agreement between ua tn and omnicare tn  as approved by the state of tennessee in november  retroactive to january despite the fact that omnicare tn agreed to reimburse the company approximately million in june for the start up and other costs incurred by the company between january and september  the transaction was not sufficiently documented to allow recognition of the same on the company s financial statements in december for fiscal  the estimated company expense related to the then proposed shareholder class action lawsuit settlement  net of insurance coverage  was million 
the proposed settlement was subject to federal court approval

earnings from discontinued operation  net of income taxes  were million in fiscal  compared to 
million in fiscal  an increase of 
million 
this change is due primarily to a contract entered into with the state of maryland s injured workers insurance fund in june liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had i cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  compared to million at june   ii working capital of negative million  compared to negative million at june   and iii a current assets to current liabilities ratio of 
to  compared to 
to at june  the principal sources of funds for the company during fiscal were million provided from net operating activities  net sales of marketable securities of million  debt borrowings of 
million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 
million offset by furniture and equipment additions of 
million  investing cash used in discontinued operation of 
million  million to repay long term debt and million to fund an unsecured loan evidenced by a surplus note issued by omnicare mi 
in previous fiscal years  to satisfy applicable statutory requirements  the company provided million in letters of credit on behalf of  and a million capital contribution to  omnicare la  and made a million capital contribution to philcare 
the foregoing funds were provided by the company from its line of credit arrangement 
due to the cessation of its louisiana operations  the company withdrew the million capital contribution and is in the process of cancelling its letter of credit commitments 
the company s board of directors has determined to withdraw from all of its involvement in pennsylvania and to pursue recouping its investment in philcare 
on september   the company sold the stock of chf for million  comprised of million in cash  a secured note for million and an unsecured note for million 
the secured note is payable to the company in four monthly installments of 
million each on the last day of september through december with the balance due in january  with options to extend the final payment to march  plus interest at the prime rate on short term unsecured commercial borrowings 
the unsecured note is payable to the company in two annual installments of 
million with the balance due august   plus interest at per annum 
the security for the secured note includes a pledge of the stock of chf and a limited personal guarantee of louis j 
nicholas  a principal of the buyer 
the proceeds from the sale of chf have been and will be used to reduce debt and provide security for the company s bank indebtedness 
on march   effective as of february   the company entered into an amended loan agreement and promissory note for a million line of credit facility with its current bank lender 
on september   the company and the bank amended the loan agreement and promissory note to decrease the line of credit amount to million and modify other terms 
the purposes of the line of credit facility as of february  were to i renew and increase the existing line of credit to pay off outstanding term loans with the same bank and ii guarantee the payment of an existing 
million letter of credit 
the agreement requires the permanent reduction of the outstanding balance and the line of credit facility a at october  to million  b at november  to million  c at december  to million  d at january  to million  e at february  to million and f at april  to the lesser of the then outstanding principal balance or million  and the cancellation of the

financial covenants for minimum net worth  debt service coverage ratio  and maximum debt to worth ratio will be established prior to march  the company is unable at this time to assess the capital requirements  if any  related to the final disposition of ultramedix 
the company s restructuring efforts significantly contributed to the million loss from continuing operations in fiscal however  after adjusting for non cash activities and changes in assets and liabilities  the company generated positive cash flows from operations in fiscal the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its future cash needs will depend on a number of factors  including the stabilization of omnicare mi  continuation of its restructuring efforts  achieving increased operational efficiencies at its tennessee operation and the collection of the chf sale proceeds 
management believes that the negative working capital  excluding the million in medical claims liability established for ultramedix and including long term debt at june  of million  can be funded from the chf sale proceeds and operations in fiscal management further expects that the omnicare mi corrective action plan  which is in the process of implementation  will stabilize that plan and eliminate the need for future cash infusions from the company 
omnicare mi has successfully renegotiated certain major hospital provider contracts  including its most significant hospital contract  which was one of the major components of the corrective action plan  the effects of which will reduce medical costs
