the company then contributed to fac properties  lp  a delaware limited partnership the operating partnership substantially all of its assets and liabilities  except for legal title to properties  which remains in a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in exchange for the company s assets  the company received limited partnership interest units in the operating partnership in an amount and designation that corresponded to the number and designation of outstanding shares of capital stock of the company at the time 
the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership 
as additional limited partners are admitted to the operating partnership in exchange for the contribution of properties  the company s percentage ownership in the operating partnership will decline 
as the company issues additional shares of capital stock  it will contribute the proceeds for that capital stock to the operating partnership in exchange for a number of units equal to the number of shares that the company issues

an eighth center is expected to close in second quarter of the ninth and final center will be managed by the company and is expected to be acquired in the year the loan assumption fee is currently unreasonable  however  the loan is prepayable in the year economic conditions inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years with certain segments of the economy experiencing disinflation  such as  apparel pricing which has slowed the growth of tenant sales which adversely impacts the company s revenue due to lower percentage and overage rents on some properties 
additionally  weakness in the overall retail environment as it relates to tenant sales volumes may have an impact on the company s ability to renew leases at current rental rates or to release space to other tenants 
although the decline in sales does not effect base rental  aside from renewals  this weakness could result in reduced revenue from percentage rent tenants  as well as  overage rent paid to the company 
both revenue items are directly impacted by sales volumes and represented of the company s total revenue in continuance of this trend may affect the company s operating centers the properties occupancy rate and the rental rates obtained and concessions  if any  granted on new leases or re leases of space  which may cause fluctuations in the cash flow from the operation and performance of the properties 
in the event of higher inflation  however  a majority of the tenants leases contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the majority of the company s leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses  including marketing  common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases with two of its anchor tenants  vf factory outlet and carolina pottery  which were executed prior to june  require the tenants to pay certain operating expenses and increases in common area maintenance expenses  which reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

the properties are subject to operating risks common to commercial real estate in general  any and all of which may adversely affect occupancy or rental rates 
the properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as cleaning  electricity  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  insurance and administrative costs  and other general costs associated with security  landscaping  repairs and maintenance 
while the company s tenants generally are currently obligated to pay a portion of these escalating costs  there can be no assurance that tenants will agree to pay such costs upon renewal or that new tenants will agree to pay such costs 
if operating expenses increase  the local rental market may limit the extent to which rents may be increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates 
additionally  inflation may have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
approximately of the company s debt on income properties and notes payable as of december  bore interest at rates that adjust periodically based on market conditions 
following the closing of the million permanent debt facility described above  and the receipt of proceeds from sale of common shares to psr  also described above  the company s exposure to floating rate debt will be significantly reduced 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
substantially all of the company s existing tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants 
the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms by attracting creditworthy national brand name manufacturers  upscale  high fashion manufacturers and new tenants that offer a wide range of merchandise and amenities not previously offered
