changes in the insurance industry may create opportunities for the company

recent developments on march   the board of directors adopted a resolution to change the company s fiscal year end to december effective in the company will file form k for the twelve months ended march   form q for each of the three month periods ended june  and september   and form k for the nine months ended december  on may   the company s stockholders adopted a proposal to amend the company s certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split and the authorized shares reduction 
the reverse stock split and authorized shares reduction was effective as of the open of the nasdaq smallcap market on may  the effective time 
at the effective time  each share of common stock issued and outstanding was automatically reclassified and converted into one fifth a share of common stock 
fractional shares of common stock resulting from the reverse stock split were not issued and instead holders thereof will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares 
all shares and per share information presented as of may  gives effect to the reverse stock split and authorized shares reduction 
the principal reason for the reverse stock split was to increase the trading price per share of the common stock in order to comply with the revised standards for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which went into effect on february  the new nasdaq listing requirements required  among other things  that the minimum bid price per share of a listed company was 
during the calendar year  the closing bid price of the common stock ranged from to 
subsequent to the reverse stock split the closing bid price for the common stock ranged from to 
there is no assurance  however  that the reverse stock split will enable the common stock to trade above the minimum bid price or that the company will otherwise be able to maintain its listing on the nasdaq smallcap market

in october  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which supersedes sop the company will be required to adopt sop for software transactions entered into beginning april   and retroactive application to years prior to adoption is prohibited 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements ie  software products  upgrades enhancements  postcontract customer support  installation  training  etc 
to be allocated to each element based on relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence which is specific to the vendor 
the revenue allocated to software products including specified upgrades enhancements generally is recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenue allocated to postcontract customer support generally is recognized ratably over the term of the support and revenue allocated to service elements such as training and installation generally is recognized as the services are performed 
if a vendor does not have evidence of the fair value of all elements in a multiple element arrangement  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or all elements are delivered 
management anticipates that the adoption of sop will not have a material impact on the company s operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal use computer programs and its software products that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  the inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
based on a preliminary assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace some of its internal use software and modify certain existing products so that the software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to these certain products and conversions to new internal use software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company or its customers 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or not completed timely  the year issue could have a material effect on the company and customers utilizing certain products 
the company has warranted that certain products are year compliant and that certain products will be made year compliant 
the company has initiated formal communication with its vendors to determine the extent to which the company s software products are vulnerable to those third parties failure to correct their own year issues 
generally  software provided by third parties and included in the company s systems is developed by leading software suppliers with year programs in process 
there can be no guarantee that the software of other companies  on which the company s systems rely  will be timely or properly converted 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace and test its software products for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project as soon as practical but prior to any anticipated impact 
the total cost of the year project has not yet been determined  but will be funded through existing cash resources and future operating cash flows 
the requirements and timetable for the correction of year issues are based on management s best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
