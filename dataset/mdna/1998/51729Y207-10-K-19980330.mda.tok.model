the company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report and in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties on the risks and factors that may affect the company s business 
over the past several years  larscom has transitioned its business from supplying single purpose t and ft wide area network customer premises equipment cpe to fortune corporations  to providing high speed network access platform solutions predominantly to nsps 
from through  larscom engaged primarily in the development  marketing and support of t csu dsus and t diagnostic equipment 
in october  the company acquired t technologies inc tt  a broadband products company 
the first broadband products developed by larscom after the acquisition of tt were the access t  one of the first t dsus  and the mega t  the first multiple t inverse multiplexer 
since then  the company has invested significant resources in developing a suite of broadband capabilities for the orion platform 
sales related to the company s broadband products access t  etherspan  mega t and orion represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of netedge further expanding its broadband product line 
a small number of customers  consisting of nsps and resellers  have accounted for a majority of the company s revenues in each of the past several years 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for   and of revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to nsps represented  and in  and  respectively 
sales to nsps and resellers are often difficult to forecast due to the relatively long sales cycle and acceleration or delays in the timing of specific equipment deployment projects for which the nsp or reseller is acquiring equipment 
the company has experienced fluctuations in both annual and quarterly revenues due to the timing of receipt of customer orders as well as decisions from time to time by major customers to cease marketing  purchasing and reselling the company s products 
since the company continues to have significant sales to a small number of customers  similar sales fluctuations may occur in the future 
since most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  the company s ability to predict revenues is limited 
in addition  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in the event that anticipated orders from major customers fail to materialize  or delivery schedules are deferred or canceled as a result of the above factors or other unanticipated factors  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels and margins  however  expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact of the revenue shortfall on the company s operating results may be greater due to the company s inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
the company sells its products primarily through a direct sales force and to a lesser extent through a variety of resellers  including oems  vars  systems integrators and distributors 
sales outside the us have not been significant to date 
on december   larscom entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the agreement 
the agreement provided for the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into netedge systems inc netedge a privately held designer and manufacturer of atm edge access equipment  headquartered in research triangle park  north carolina  which was consummated on december  the total merger consideration paid by larscom consisted of  in cash and acquisition costs of  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  on this basis  the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to various intangible assets  primarily consisting of in process research and development  current technology  trademarks and goodwill based on an independent third party valuation 
the company recorded a charge to earnings of million for acquired in process research and development related to netedge 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development charge related to acquisition total operating expenses operating income loss non operating income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to  in from  in the growth in revenues reflected increased sales of the company s broadband products  particularly the orion  which were partially offset by a small decrease in sales of digital access products 
sales to nsps continue to account for an increasing percentage of total revenue 
the company expects sales of broadband products to increase both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenues due to increased sales of the edge product line and increases in sales of orion products 
gross profit 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in from in this increase was primarily a result of changes in revenue mix to higher margin broadband products and to a lesser extent lower per unit material costs  offset by declining prices of digital access products 
gross profits in and future years  as compared to  will be reduced by  due to the annual amortization of purchased technology related to the acquisition of netedge 
gross profits as a percentage of revenues will also fluctuate depending upon a number of other factors  but primarily as a result of changes in product mix  discounts given and changes in production volume 
the company is continuing to seek to increase broadband product sales and to reduce the cost of its broadband products as well as its digital access products 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to offset the anticipated decline in the average selling prices of both broadband and digital access products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in primarily due to increased headcount working on both the broadband and digital access product lines 
the company believes that a continued commitment to research and development  particularly related to broadband products and emerging technologies in response to customer demands  will be required to remain competitive  although research and development as a percentage of revenues should remain relatively constant 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in from in the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to additional personnel costs in the sales  marketing and administrative functions 
this was offset by lower commissions and amortization expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include a charge from axel johnson for legal  accounting  tax  treasury and administrative services 
for and  these charges were approximately  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as a result of the company s continued investment in the expansion of its sales  service and support organizations  the development of its distribution channels particularly outside the united states and the acquisition of netedge 
the company expects these costs to be partially offset by reductions in the charge for administrative services from axel johnson 
in process research and development

the effective tax benefit rate for of differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of state taxes 
as a result of the acquisition of netedge  the company recorded a deferred tax asset of  related to the company s in process research and development charge discussed above 
the company believes that recovery of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not and accordingly has not established any valuation allowance against it 
in future periods  if it is anticipated that the company is not able to generate sufficient taxable profits to recover its deferred tax assets it will necessary to record a valuation allowance against this asset which could have a significant impact on earnings 
the effective tax rate of for differed from the federal statutory rate as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization and state taxes

research and development 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses declined to in from in due to increased revenues which were offset by an increase in research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses in was due primarily to a increase in headcount during  as well as increased costs associated with product safety and country specific product certification 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in from in the increase in absolute dollars was due to additional personnel costs associated with expansion of the company s sales and marketing resources  as well as higher selling expenses associated with higher revenues

liquidity and capital resources since its acquisition by axel johnson in and until its initial public offering in december  the company met its operating and capital requirements primarily from cash flow from operations and advances from axel johnson 
the company s operating activities generated  in cash in cash generated by operations was primarily the result of net income  before the in process research and development charge  and increases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory

to date the company has not found it necessary to utilize this line of credit 
in addition to such credit agreement  the company and axel johnson entered into an administrative service agreement and a tax sharing agreement for the purposes of defining the on going relationship between them 
see footnotes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company paid cash of  and incurred acquisition costs of  to purchase netedge 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  on this basis  the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to various intangible assets  primarily consisting of in process research and development  current technology  trademarks and goodwill based on an independent third party valuation 
the company estimated that the useful economic lives of the current technology  trademarks and goodwill were five  seven and six years  respectively 
the company recorded a charge to earnings of million for acquired in process research and development related to netedge 
capital expenditures in of  were principally for the purchase of computers  software and test equipment as well as leasehold improvements on the new building occupied in september the company expects capital expenditures during to be approximately  the company believes that working capital together with the company s line of credit and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and capital requirements at least through there can  however  be no assurance that future events  such as the potential use of cash to fund acquisitions  will not require the company to seek additional capital at an earlier date or  if so required  that adequate capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the effects of inflation on the company s revenues and operating income have not been material 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas and statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas established rules for reporting and displaying comprehensive income 
sfas will require the company to use the management approach in disclosing segment information 
both statements are effective for the company during the company does not believe that the adoption of either sfas or sfas will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
certain risk factors year compliance 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation could be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
larscom products use a two digit year value rather than a four digit value 
based on preliminary tests performed on products that account for substantially all of our revenues we believe that there will be no significant impact as the year changes from to this is because the date carried in the internal workings of the company s products do not affect the operation of the networks of which these products are a part 
the company is in the process of performing additional testing procedures to clarify any other issues that may exist related to the year but does not believe that the costs of this testing will be material or that the costs of potential changes to products will be material 
any failure of the company s products to perform  including system malfunctions due to the onset of the calendar year  could result in claims against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also currently in the process of evaluating its information technology infrastructure for year compliance  including reviewing what actions are required to make all software systems used internally year compliant as well as actions needed to mitigate vulnerability to problems with suppliers and other third parties systems 
the company is assessing the extent of the necessary modifications to its computer software  and management does not anticipate that the company will incur significant operating expenses or be required to invest heavily in computer system improvements to be year compliant 
there can be no assurance that such measures will alleviate the year problems which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
customer concentration 
the company believes that its relationships with large customers  particularly the nsps and telecommunications companies  will be critical to its future success 
a small number of customers have accounted for a majority of the company s revenues in each of the past several years 
in  and  nsps and isps represented  and  respectively  of total revenues and the company s top five customers accounted for   and of revenues in  and  respectively 
none of the company s customers are contractually obliged to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period  and product sales to major customers have varied widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders from existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
the company s future operating results are highly dependent on continuing market acceptance of the company s newest products  particularly in the broadband area 
broadband product sales represented of revenues during and are expected to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenues in the longer term although the proportion of broadband sales to total revenues may vary from quarter to quarter 
there can be no assurance that these products or any future products will continue to achieve widespread market acceptance 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
the company s potential inability to develop and introduce new products or versions in a timely manner  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  or to achieve timely and widespread market acceptance of its new products or releases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
the company depends upon its suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company obtains components and licenses certain embedded software from numerous single sources 
other than components and software supplied by waferscale  vicor  xilinx and pmc sierra  the company believes it would be able to develop alternative sources for components and software used in its products without incurring substantial additional costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the inability of the company to develop alternative sources  if required  an inability by such suppliers to meet the company s demand or a prolonged interruption in supply or a significant price increase of one or more components or software will not occur  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company generally does not have any long term contracts with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company s requirements 
any significant interruption in the supply or degradation in the quality of any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
rapid technological change 
the telecommunications equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
if the company were to be unsuccessful or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
limited independent operating history 
the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of axel johnson since until the date of the company s ipo and accordingly  has had limited independent operating history 
the company will be required to further develop financial  management  administrative and other resources previously provided by axel johnson which are necessary to operate successfully as an independent public company 
although the company and axel johnson have entered into several agreements that are intended to ease the company s transition to an independent public company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage this transition or to develop these independent resources successfully 
the company has access  subject to certain conditions  to a  credit facility provided by axel johnson  however there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available upon the expiration or termination of such facility or that additional sources of funding will be available on terms favorable to the company if the company s borrowing requirements exceed the amount of the facility 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  absence of significant backlog 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s sales historically have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
therefore  sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon product shipments to a limited number of customers 
sales to individual large customers are often related to the customer s specific equipment deployment projects  the timing of which are subject to change on limited notice 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
for example  since sales to mci  ibm advantis  at t  uunet and other current customers have occasionally varied by up to million from quarter to quarter 
since most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  the company s backlog and consequent ability to predict revenues is limited 
in addition  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in the event that anticipated orders from major customers fail to materialize  or delivery schedules are deferred or canceled as a result of the above factors or other unanticipated factors  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
the company s backlog at any point in time is typically limited 
accordingly  sales in any quarter are largely dependent on orders received during that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
therefore  customer decisions to delay delivery  cancel orders or reduce purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  cost of components  manufacturing costs and amortization of certain intangible assets 
for example  a price reduction of a particular product in response to competitive pressure which is not offset by a reduction in production costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins would decrease the company s overall gross margin and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company s anticipated increase in overall spending in future periods in order to pursue new market opportunities might also affect operating margins 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels and margins  however  expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact of the revenue shortfall on the company s operating results may be greater due to the company s inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for the shortfall 
results in any period could also be affected by changes in market demand  competitive market conditions  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  the mix of the company s customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  sales promotion activities by the company  the company s ability to expand its sales and marketing organization effectively  the company s ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees and general economic conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results in one or more future periods may be subject to significant fluctuations 
in the event this results in the company s financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of the company s class a common stock could be materially adversely affected 
control by axel johnson 
holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to four votes per share  subject to adjustment  to preserve the initial voting ratio 
axel johnson is the sole holder of the class b common stock 
as a result  axel johnson has sufficient voting power to control the direction and policies of the company  including mergers  the payment of dividends  consolidations  the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and the election of the board of directors of the company  and to prevent or cause a change in control of the company 
in addition  the authorized but unissued capital stock of the company includes  shares of preferred stock the preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the designations  preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional or other rights and restrictions thereof 
accordingly  the company may issue a series of preferred stock in the future that will have preference over both classes of the company s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up or which could otherwise adversely affect holders of the common stock or discourage or make difficult any attempt to obtain control of the company 
such control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company has had minimal sales to international customers to date  and has had little experience in international markets 
the company believes that international sales will increase due in large part to the acquisition of netedge and also to increased international sales of the company s existing products 
the conduct of business outside the us is subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations  expropriation and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the us could deny or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
management of expanding operations 
the growth in the company s business has placed a significant strain on the company s personnel  management and other resources  and is expected to continue to do so 
in order to manage any future expansion effectively  the company must attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  integrate new management and employees into its overall operations and continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems  particularly as the company continues to transition from services previously provided by axel johnson 
availability of qualified sales and technical personnel is limited  and competition for experienced sales and technical personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
moreover  the company expects to increase significantly the size of its domestic and international sales support staff and expand the scope of its sales and marketing activities 
the company s failure to manage any expansion effectively  including the above factors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the us the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as industry standards established by various organizations 
as standards for new services such as atm evolve  the company may be required to modify its existing products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
an important element of the company s strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
the company has no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any such acquisitions 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and or the incurrence of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s class a common stock 
in this regard  as a result of the ownership interest of axel johnson in the company  the company will not be able to use pooling of interests accounting for any future acquisition 
accordingly  such acquisitions could result in amortization of goodwill and other charges including the immediate write off of purchased research and development in process typically associated with purchase accounting 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with the acquisition of netedge 
in addition to risks described under risks associated with potential acquisitions  the company faces significant risks associated with its recent acquisition of netedge 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the desired benefits of this acquisition 
in order to successfully integrate netedge  the company must  among other things  continue to attract and retain key personnel  integrate the acquired products from both engineering and sales and marketing perspectives  and consolidate facilities 
difficulties encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company used purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition of netedge  resulting in a charge to be taken each of the next five to seven years for the amortization of intangible assets 
as a result  the company expects that the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings in limited protection of intellectual property  proprietary information 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secrets  contractual restrictions  copyrights  trademark laws and patents to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
although the company has been issued only one us patent to date  it believes that the success of its business depends primarily on its proprietary technology  information and processes and know how  rather than patents 
much of the company s proprietary information and technology is not patented and may not be patentable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
the company has entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of its employees  and enters into non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected
