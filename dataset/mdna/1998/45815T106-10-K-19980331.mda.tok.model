the company has settled its dispute with coulter corporation coulter arising from the termination of its exclusive sales and distribution agreement the coulter agreement with coulter 
the company terminated the coulter agreement in the fourth quarter of because of coulter s revocation of its commitment to purchase  of micro systems during the third and fourth quarters of and other breaches of the coulter agreement by coulter 
coulter disputed the company s termination of the coulter agreement  claiming that the coulter agreement remained in effect 
the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration 
after the close of business on march   the parties settled their dispute and entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company granted coulter the right to purchase micro systems for distribution worldwide on a nonexclusive basis  at transfer prices set by the company 
to the extent and for so long as the company sells micro systems through other distributors  coulter will have the right to purchase micro systems on the same terms on a country by country basis 
the company and coulter agreed to arrangements for the provision of service and support to end users of micro systems 
as part of the settlement terminating coulter s exclusive rights of sales and distribution  the company agreed to pay to coulter approximately  subject to certain offsets  in exchange for i the return of twenty six of coulter s used inventory of micro systems and certain spare parts and equipment  ii the assignment of four of coulter s customer contract receivables  and iii reimbursement to coulter for certain costs incurred in connection with the sale and marketing of the micro system 
in addition  the company agreed to sell up to twenty one micro systems to coulter at a special discounted transfer price and coulter agreed to purchase four micro systems promptly for placement in japan

the company believes that this program will augment its sales and long term lease programs by giving potential customers the ability to fund a micro with operating funds  thereby  overcoming potential cost barriers associated with limited or non existent capital expenditure funds 
expansion of the short term rental program may require that the company secure additional financing

outlook this section captioned outlook and other parts of this annual report on form k include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
actual results and the occurrence or timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in any of such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
see other factors relating to forward looking statements below 
build up of the company s internal sales force  changes in sales strategy 
costs and delays associated with the company s efforts to build its internal sales and service force in the wake of termination of the coulter agreement have adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in and may continue to do so through however  the company believes that its understanding of the nature of and advantages of the use of the micro system and the training it provides and will provide to its internal sales  marketing and service force will ultimately position the company to achieve better results by selling micro systems directly to end users than the company has realized or could realize with an exclusive distribution relationship with one distributor 
in addition  the company s ability to set prices and to sell the micro system directly to end users will provide the company with a greater ability to enter into more flexible pricing arrangements with end users who lease or purchase a micro system 
such flexibility may increase the number of end users who are financially able to purchase or lease a micro system  result in increased margins on a per unit basis  and result in increased gross and net revenues to the company for and beyond 
however  there can be no guarantee or assurance that increased pricing flexibility and direct selling efforts by the company will result in an increase in the number of potential end users  an increase in sales  or greater margins or gross or net revenues 
in addition  while the company intends to focus its marketing and sales efforts on direct sales  the company may continue to sell micro systems to coulter pursuant to the settlement agreement and to other distributors for resale to customers  and substantial sales to distributors may be possible only at transfer prices substantially lower than projected prices for direct sales 
in addition to the foregoing considerations  during the fourth quarter of the company began to offer a short term rental program which provides for monthly or annual rentals of the micro system 
the company believes that this program will augment its sales and long term lease programs by giving potential customers the ability to fund a micro with operating funds  thereby overcoming potential cost barriers associated with limited or non existent capital expenditure funds 
expansion of the short term rental program may require that the company secure additional financing 
additional funds for this purpose may be sought through equity or debt financings 
there can be no assurance that commitments for such financings can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
product development 
the company believes that manual performance of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures are costly  time consuming and subject to varying degrees of accuracy and consistency 
the company anticipates that the demand for automated microscopy and its attendant ability to reduce laboratory costs and exposure to liability  enhance analytical accuracy and consistency  increase the productivity of medical technologists and improve patient care will continue to increase in the future 
the company s ability to react quickly to a rise in the demand for automated microscopy products by developing a product or line of products that will perform a broad number of microscopic procedures will be critical to the company s success 
the company intends to continue to seek to develop  either internally or through licensing arrangements  products that can meet such demand for a variety of automated microscopic procedures 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop such products before the company can  or that any products developed by the company  even if timely  will receive sufficient fda clearance or approval or will meet with greater market acceptance than those manufactured by the company s competitors 
health care cost containment considerations 
the company believes that pressure in the health care industry to control and contain patient care costs has increased and will continue to increase 
such pressure may result in increased demand for the micro system from those end users who can benefit from the cost savings and other benefits provided by the micro system because they will continue to perform the same type and volume of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures 
if  however  such cost containment pressures result in an actual reduction in the number and type of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures performed ie  a reduction in precautionary testing  the cost savings and other benefits of the micro systems would decrease  and accordingly  demand for the micro system may also decrease 
consolidation of management of health care facilities 
the continuing trend toward consolidation of laboratories and hospitals by acquisitions and through the formation of affiliated and nonaffiliated purchasing groups will create opportunities for penetration of the market by sales efforts directed at the principal decision makers for such groups 
imi entered into two group purchasing agreements in the first was with amerinet  a network of over hospitals and independent laboratories 
the second was with magnet  a network with over hospitals 
market penetration could be more difficult if sales of micro systems are not made through such large purchasing groups 
arbitration with diasys corporation 
in its demand for arbitration  diasys seeks damages in excess of  for imi s alleged breach of the diasys agreement by failing to pay for products delivered and failing to order and pay for additional products under the diasys agreement 
diasys also seeks damages for imi s alleged defamation of diasys and its products 
imi denies that it breached the diasys agreement or defamed diasys  and believes that it properly rejected products supplied by diasys due to non conformance 
imi also seeks damages for libelous statements made by diasys in a july  press release issued by diasys  and for delays in imi s product development efforts caused by diasys s breach of the diasys agreement 
the parties are presently in the process of selecting the panel of arbitrators and no hearing date for the arbitration has been scheduled 
the company believes that diasys s claims are without merit  and that the company will prevail in the arbitration 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in the arbitration or in its counterclaim asserted against diasys  or that any resolution of the dispute  which is expected to occur within one year  would be on terms favorable to the company 
an adverse decision in the arbitration could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
until recently  many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year utilizing both internal and external resources  the company is in the process of defining  assessing and converting or replacing various programs  hardware and instrumentation systems to make them year compatible 
the company s year project is comprised of two components business applications and equipment 
the business applications component consists of the company s business computer systems  as well as the computer systems of third party suppliers or customers  whose year problems could potentially impact the company 
equipment exposures consist of personal computers  system servers and telephone equipment whose year problems could also impact the company 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
while management believes that its products  the micro and neuralvision software  are currently capable of storing four digit year data  allowing applications to differentiate between dates from the s and the year and beyond  such potential incompatibility with two digit application programs may limit the company s sales of product in those situations 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be integrated by the company or its customers with  or otherwise interact with  non compliant software or other products which may expose the company to claims from it customers or other third parties 
the foregoing could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products  increased service costs to the company or payment by the company of compensatory or other damages 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s software product that is designed to be year compliant contains all necessary technology to make it year compliant
