the company has also established a human resource allocation team to ensure that it professionals are quickly placed on assignments to minimize nonbillable time and are placed on assignments that utilize their technical skills and allow for maximum billing rates 
in addition  the company has realized higher gross profit margins from the company s shift to offshore projects in india  where the salaries of it professionals are lower as a percentage of professional service fees 
this benefit is partially offset due to additional coordination efforts and costs for offshore projects

the principal use of cash for investing activities during the three fiscal years ending december  was for the purchase of property and equipment and computer software primarily as part of the development and enhancement of the company s offshore software development centers

 and were issued 
the company will adopt this statement in fiscal year factors that may affect future results recruitment and retention of it professionals the company s business involves delivering it services and is labor intensive 
the company s success depends upon its ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled it professionals and project managers possessing the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver the company s services 
qualified it professionals are in high demand worldwide and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that qualified it professionals will continue to be available to the company in sufficient numbers  or at wages that the company is able to pass along to clients  or that the company will be successful in retaining current or future employees 
failure to attract or retain qualified it professionals in sufficient numbers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
historically  the company has conducted a significant portion of its recruiting outside the countries where the client s work was performed 
accordingly  any perception among the company s it professionals  whether or not well founded  that the company s ability to assist them in obtaining h b temporary work permits and permanent residency status has diminished could lead to significant employee attrition which could result in the company incurring increased costs for it professionals 
government regulation of immigration the company recruits its it professionals on a global basis to create a workforce that it can deploy wherever required and  therefore  must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which it operates  particularly the united states 
as of march   approximately of cbsi s worldwide workforce was working under h b temporary work permits in the united states 
there is a limit on the number of new h b permits that may be approved in a fiscal year 
in years in which this limit is reached  the company may be unable to obtain enough h b permits to meet its personnel requirements 
if the company were unable to obtain h b permits for its employees in sufficient quantities or at a sufficient rate  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  congress and administrative agencies with jurisdiction over immigration matters have periodically expressed concerns over the levels of legal and illegal immigration into the us these concerns have often resulted in proposed legislation  rules and regulations aimed at reducing the number of work permits that may be issued 
any changes in such laws and regulations making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting the ability of the company to retain foreign employees  could require the company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and other expenses 
any such restrictions or limitations on the company s hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
increasing significance and risks of non us operations the company s international consulting and offshore software development operations are important elements of its growth strategy 
the company opened offices in the united kingdom in  in chennai  india in  in bangalore  india in and in hyderabad  india in these operations depend greatly upon political climate and business and technology transfer laws in those countries  and upon the continued development of technology infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that the company s international operations will continue to be profitable or support the company s growth strategy 
the risks inherent in the company s international business activities include unexpected changes in the political climate  regulatory environments  foreign currency fluctuations  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in managing international operations and potential foreign tax consequences  including repatriation of earnings and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
the company s failure to manage growth  attract and retain personnel  manage major development efforts  or profitably deliver services or a significant interruption in the company s ability to transmit data via satellite  could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to maintain and develop successfully is international operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see business cbsi growth strategies 
the company s international operations are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  political risks and risk of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
variability operating results the company s revenues and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during the quarter  the number of working days in a quarter  employee hiring  attrition and utilization rates and progress on fixed price projects during the quarter 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses  in particular personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed  a variation in revenues may cause significant variations in operating results 
additionally  the company periodically incurs cost increases due to both the hiring of new employees and strategic investments in its infrastructure in anticipation of future opportunities for revenue growth 
no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
decrease in demand for year services the company expects that it will continue to receive increased revenues from additional year engagements in the near term 
however  the company expects that year engagements and revenues derived from such engagements will peak prior to calendar year as companies address their needs 
thereafter  the company expects that revenues derived from year engagements will steadily decline 
in the absence of additional revenues from other sources  a decline in such engagements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
exposure to conditions in india a significant element of the company s business strategy is to continue to develop its offshore software development centers in bangalore and chennai  india 
as of march   the company had approximately of its workforce in india 
the indian government  as a means of encouraging foreign investment  has provided significant tax incentives and exemptions to regulatory restrictions 
certain of these benefits that directly affect the company include  among others  tax holidays temporary exemptions from taxation on operating income and liberalized import and export duties 
to be eligible for certain of these tax benefits  the company must meet certain conditions 
a failure to meet such conditions in the future could result in the cancellation of the benefits 
there can be no assurance that such tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels 
with respect to duties  subject to certain conditions  goods  raw materials and components for production imported by the company s offices in india are currently exempt from the levy of a customs duty 
although wage costs in india are significantly lower than in the us and elsewhere for comparably skilled it professionals  wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the us in the past  india has experienced significant inflation and shortages of foreign exchange  and has been subject to civil unrest and acts of terrorism 
although the inflation rate for the periods has been insignificant  increases in inflation in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  changes in interest rates  taxation or other social  political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fixed price projects the company undertakes certain projects on a fixed price basis  as distinguished from billing on a time and materials basis 
significant cost overruns on fixed price projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
these risks may be heightened if the company acts as a subcontractor on a fixed price project because of its limited ability to control project variables and to negotiate directly with the ultimate client 
although the company intends to solicit fewer fixed price project engagements in the future  there can be no assurance that any fixed price project engagements that are accepted by the company will be profitable 
failure to achieve profitability on any fixed price project engagement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition the it services industry is highly competitive and served by numerous national  regional and local firms  all of which are either existing or potential competitors of the company 
primary competitors include cambridge technology partners  information management resources  inc  keane  inc 
and participants within a variety of market segments  including big six accounting firms  implementation firms  software applications firms  service groups of computer equipment companies  general management consulting firms  programming companies and temporary staffing firms 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the company s markets and the company has faced  and expects to continue to face  additional competition from new entrants into its markets 
moreover  there is a risk that clients may elect to increase their internal it resources to satisfy their applications solutions needs 
further  the it services industry is undergoing consolidation which may result in increasing pressure on margins 
these factors may limit the company s ability to increase prices commensurate with increases in compensation 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
management of growth the company has experienced rapid growth that has placed significant demands on the company s managerial  administrative and operational resources 
revenues have grown from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  and the number of employees has grown from as of december  to  as of december  the company s continued growth depends on its ability to recruit and retain it professionals  to increase its international operations  to add service lines and to further expand its offshore facilities 
effective management of growth initiatives will require the company to continue to improve its operational  financial and other management processes and systems and to train  motivate and manage its it professionals 
failure to manage growth effectively and to train  motivate and manage its it professionals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technology change the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changing client preferences and new product introductions 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with changes in the it industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s services noncompetitive or obsolete 
the company s failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
a significant number of organizations are attempting to migrate business applications from a mainframe environment to advanced technologies  including client server architectures and packaged software solutions 
as a result  the company s ability to remain competitive will be dependent on several factors  including its ability to help existing employees maintain or develop mainframe skills and to train and hire employees with skills in advanced technologies 
the company s failure to hire  train and retain employees with such skills could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business 
the company s ability to remain competitive will also be dependent on its ability to design and implement  in a timely and cost effective manner  effective transition strategies for clients moving from the mainframe environment to client server  packaged software or other advanced architectures 
the failure of the company to design and implement such transition strategies in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
risks related to acquisitions and mergers as a significant part of its business strategy  the company has expanded and will continue to seek to expand its operations through the acquisition of or merger with additional businesses that complement its core skills and have the potential to increase the overall value of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into the company without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial problems 
the company continuously evaluates potential business combinations 
future acquisitions and mergers may involve a number of special risks  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  unanticipated events or circumstances  legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
client satisfaction or performance problems within an acquired firm could have a material adverse impact on the reputation of the company as a whole 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired businesses  if any  will achieve anticipated revenues and earnings 
the failure of the company to manage its acquisition strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company may issue additional shares of its common stock to acquire such additional businesses which may dilute earnings per share and reduce the percentage ownership of existing shareholders 
potential liability to clients many of the company s engagements  including year projects  involve projects that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
although the company attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from errors  mistakes  omissions or negligent acts in rendering its services  there can be no assurance that its attempts to limit liability will be successful 
the company s failure or inability to meet a client s expectations in the execution of its services could result in a material adverse change to the client s operations and  therefore  could give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation  adversely affecting its business  operating results and financial condition 
absence of long term contracts the typical contractual engagement with a client is for a term of one to three years 
generally  there is no assurance that a client will renew its contract when it terminates 
in addition  the company s contracts are generally cancelable by the client with to days notice 
under such contracts  clients may unilaterally reduce the use of the company s services without penalty 
failure by the company to retain its existing clients would materially adversely effect its results of operations
