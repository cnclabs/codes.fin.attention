while these efforts will involve additional costs  the company believes  based upon currently available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  or results of operations 
however  if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the cost of updating or replacing the company s information systems exceeds the company s current estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations

forward looking statements this form k includes forward looking statements statements which are not historical facts such as statements about future net revenues and profits  capital expenditures  liquidity sources and needs  working capital needs  increases in headcount  the year issue  and project personnel costs  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and other costs as a percentage of net revenues 
these forward looking statements are subject to several risks and uncertainties and the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
while it is impossible to identify each factor and event that could affect the company s results  variations in the company s revenues and operating results occur from time to time as a result of a number of factors  such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during the year  the number of working days in a year  employee hiring  retention  and utilization rates  acceptance and profitability of the company s services in new territories  and integration of companies acquired 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of the assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  particularly at or near the end of any year  can cause significant variations in operating results from year to year
