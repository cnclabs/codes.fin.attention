item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and overview the fiscal results of operations were a significant improvement over fiscal this was due primarily to the continued strength of the barge drilling operations in the transition zones and most international land drilling markets 
the addition of hercules shallow water and platform drilling business in the gulf of mexico  which acquisition closed in december  also contributed to these positive results 
despite the improvement of fiscal over fiscal  during the last six months of fiscal the oilfield services industry experienced a significant decline in activity 
this decline follows two years of high activity during which oil and gas companies had increased their exploration and production budgets in response to increasing demand and stronger oil and gas prices 
the first half of fiscal reflects this increased demand through rig dayrates and utilization that were at year highs with many segments at or near full utilization 
during the second half of fiscal oil prices have declined to their lowest level in years adjusted for inflation 
the sharp drop in oil prices is the result of a surplus of crude oil in worldwide markets  which has been brought about by reduced demand  particularly in southeast asia  an increase in crude oil production by opec producing countries in mid to late  and a relatively warm winter in the united states and europe 
the decline in crude oil prices has negatively impacted the revenues and profits of oil operators  who have responded by reducing exploration and development expenditures 
this decline in spending has adversely affected the level of oil field activity  and in turn  the revenues of most companies in the oil field service industry 
the impact of these market conditions has been felt most by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in service activity has continued subsequent to the end of fiscal utilization and dayrates have continued to decrease and the company will incur a loss for the quarterly reporting period ending november  management is not able to predict whether or not a further decline in activity will occur or when and to what extent the level of oilfield services will recover 
management believes that cash provided by operations and funds available under the company s revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet working capital needs in results of operations introduction the company s operations and future results have been altered significantly by the acquisitions of mallard and quail in november  bolifor in july and hercules in december in addition to increasing the size and scope of the company s operations  the mallard  quail and hercules acquisitions increased the percentage of the company s revenue generated domestically 
the company generated approximately of its revenue from domestic sources in fiscal the financings related to the mallard and quail acquisitions in november  combined with the company s issuance of the convertible notes in july and million of senior notes in march  have substantially increased the company s debt levels 
at august   the company had million in total indebtedness  compared to million of total indebtedness at august  the substantial levels of debt will result in a higher level of interest expense and an increased percentage of the company s cash flows being used for debt service and may limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing for future acquisitions and capital expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources 
for the foregoing reasons  the acquisitions of mallard  quail and hercules will affect the comparability of the company s historical results of operations 
year ended august  compared to year ended august  the company s net income of million in fiscal reflects an increase of million over the million recorded in fiscal fiscal includes the entire year s results of operations of mallard  quail and bolifor  the company s fiscal acquisitions 
fiscal includes mallard and quail from their acquisition date of november  and bolifor from its acquisition date of july  additionally  fiscal includes the hercules operating results from december   its date of acquisition 
fiscal s improvement over reflects the strong drilling markets which existed primarily in the first half of the fiscal year 
the company s results include a net loss of million in the fourth quarter  a reflection of weakening demand in several of the company s markets 
the company s revenues increased million  to million  as each of the company s market segments recorded an increase in revenues 
the company s acquisitions have substantially increased revenues and affected the comparability of the figures presented in each year 
the table below indicates sources of revenue by each of the company s acquisitions twelve months ended august  land land excluding acquisitions   bolifor   mallard   total land drilling revenues   offshore mallard   hercules  total offshore drilling revenues   rental tools quail   land drilling revenues marked an improvement of million due to increased revenues in each geographic area in which the company operates 
latin america operations contributed an increase of million  to million 
the rigs acquired in the bolifor acquisition contributed million of the increase while operations in colombia and peru also reflected significant increases 
higher utilization and dayrates on certain of the rigs in these countries results of operations as compared to continued contributed to the increase 
land drilling operations in africa provided an increase in revenues of million due to the company s operations in niger in fiscal in the states comprising the former soviet union  the company s revenues of million reflected an increase of million  due primarily to increased rig utilization in kazakhstan 
additionally  the company is presently relocating one rig from pakistan to kazakhstan for a contract in that country 
in the company s asia pacific land drilling operations  revenues increased million  where increased operating days in papua new guinea offset the fiscal completion of contracts in vietnam and in the philippines 
in the united states  the company s land drilling revenue increased million due primarily to higher average dayrates than in although revenue increased in each of the markets noted in fiscal when compared to fiscal  the company has recently experienced declining utilization and dayrates in several markets as contracts have been completed 
in particular  the company s asia pacific operations  including papua new guinea and indonesia  have seen a significant reduction in rig utilization and customer demand in the latter part of fiscal the company s offshore drilling segment s revenues increased million to million  million from revenue generated by rigs purchased in the hercules acquisition and the balance due primarily to a full twelve months of the mallard operations included in the fiscal year compared to approximately months in fiscal mallard s barge drilling operations in nigeria experienced an increase in revenue of million to million  due in part to the full year of operations and near utilization of the company s three barge rigs presently in that country 
the company is currently mobilizing a rig which had previously operated in nigeria in fiscal to the caspian sea where it will begin operations in mallard s domestic drilling operations contributed to the increase in offshore revenues due to higher average dayrates and an increase in utilization days as the mallard operations were included for the entire year in fiscal weakness in mallard s workover and remedial markets resulted in a reduction in revenue from these operations and offset some of the increase in revenues discussed above 
the company s rental tool segment s revenues increased million due to the entire year s operations being included in fiscal and due to increased revenues contributed by the company s new victoria  texas rental facility 
these increases were offset by some weakening in rental tool demand in the company s core offshore louisiana market 
profit margins revenues less direct operating expenses of million reflect an increase of million from the million recorded in fiscal the land and offshore drilling segments recorded profit margin percentages as a percent of revenue of and in fiscal  respectively  percentages which are comparable to those recorded in fiscal the company s rental tool business had a decrease in profit margin percentage from to  due in part to lower margins earned by the company on the disposition on tools  higher discounts given on tool rentals and start up costs at its new victoria facility 
the reduction in demand in certain markets which began in the second half of fiscal has materially reduced profit margins as a percent of revenue in the company s fourth quarter when compared with the entire fiscal results of operations as compared to continued depreciation and amortization increased million  reflecting a full year of depreciation expense recorded on the assets purchased in the mallard  quail and bolifor acquisitions compared to the partial year in fiscal  depreciation expense related to the assets purchased in the hercules acquisition in december  and amortization of goodwill associated with the purchase price in excess of the fair market value of the assets purchased in the mallard  quail and hercules acquisitions 
these increases were somewhat offset by a change in the estimated useful life of the company s land drilling fleet used for financial depreciation purposes from to years  resulting in a reduction of million in fiscal depreciation expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expense increased million  due in part to increased costs required to support the company s expanded operations 
interest expense increased million to million  as debt incurred in november and july to finance the company s fiscal acquisitions remained outstanding all of fiscal this debt included the million senior notes issued in november and the million convertible notes issued in july additionally  in march  the company issued million of senior notes  a portion of which was used to repay the million balance on the term loan of november these increases in interest expense were offset by million of interest charges capitalized to construction projects in fiscal  compared to 
million in the prior year 
non operating other income of million reflects an increase of million which was attributable to the fiscal disposition of the company s interest in onsite technology llc at a gain of million 
fiscal s non operating other income and expense included a million write down from a blowout which damaged barge rig and a million gain from the sale of a subsidiary  parker kinetic designs  inc income taxes of million with an effective tax rate of increased from the million and effective rate the company experienced in fiscal increased revenues and taxable income from the company s foreign operations were primarily responsible for the increased tax expense recorded in fiscal results of operations year ended august  compared to year ended august  the company s fiscal results of operations were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of mallard bay drilling  inc for million and quail tools  inc for million in november the acquisitions added two new business segments to the company s traditional land drilling business offshore and transition zone drilling and workover services utilizing barge and platform rigs and the rental of specialized equipment used in drilling  production and workover applications 
the company recorded net income of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal increased land rig utilization and improved margins plus profit generated by the offshore and tool rental segments were partially offset by increased interest and depreciation and amortization expenses 
the company s results of operations included mallard s and quail s operations for the period from the acquisition date  november   through fiscal year end  august  total revenues of million in fiscal increased million  nearly doubling total revenues in fiscal offshore drilling and tool rental  the two new business segments acquired in fiscal  accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
offshore drilling revenues were derived primarily from barge drilling activity in the transition zones of the us gulf coast and nigeria 
the company furnishes rental tools in both the gulf of mexico offshore and gulf coast land markets 
total land drilling revenues increased million due to increased utilization and dayrates in several of the company s primary land markets 
drilling revenues in the united states increased million due to increased dayrates and a increase in operating days 
in latin america  land drilling revenues increased million due to increased revenues in peru  colombia and bolivia 
four rigs were active in peru for most of fiscal as compared to an average of one rig active in fiscal at fiscal year end  the company had eight rigs under contract in colombia  where revenue increased from additional activity and increased dayrates 
in july  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of bolifor  a leading provider of land contract drilling services in bolivia 
assets acquired included land rigs located in bolivia  paraguay and argentina 
results of operations as compared to continued land drilling revenues in the asia pacific region increased million due to increased drilling services provided in indonesia and increased rig utilization in pakistan  where the company had three rigs under contract at fiscal year end 
drilling activity in the former soviet union and middle east countries remained nearly the same as in fiscal however  at fiscal year end  the company was mobilizing one land rig to niger for a one rig contract and moving a land rig from russia to kazakhstan to begin a drilling program from a gravel island in the caspian sea 
additionally  the company was modifying one of its barge rigs that previously operated in nigeria  for service in the caspian sea 
land drilling revenues generated a profit margin revenue less direct operating expense of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
increased profit margins resulted from increased rig utilization and higher dayrates as previously discussed 
the offshore drilling and tool rental segments acquired in fiscal generated profit margins of million and million  respectively 
the increased profit margins of million were somewhat offset by million higher depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in interest expense 
higher depreciation and amortization expense was attributable to a combined million depreciation for mallard and quail and million of goodwill amortization in fiscal increased interest expense resulted from million of debt incurred in november to finance the mallard and quail acquisitions and the issuance of million of convertible notes in july a million increase in interest income was due to higher cash and cash equivalent levels maintained during the year 
other income decreased million due primarily to reduced gains on sales of assets in fiscal included in other income was a million write down resulting from a blowout which damaged barge rig no 
and a million gain from the sale of a subsidiary  parker kinetic designs  inc general and administrative expense decreased million principally due to non recurring severance costs in fiscal associated with a reduction in corporate personnel 
the increase in income tax expense was attributable to improved international operations and the addition in fiscal of offshore drilling in nigeria and offset by a million reversal in fiscal of an income tax accrual in a country where the company terminated operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments of million at august   a decrease of million from the august  balance 
the acquisition of hercules in december for million was the primary reason for the decrease 
in fiscal  operating activities provided cash of million  of which million was from net income plus non cash charges  primarily depreciation and amortization of goodwill 
the balance of the cash provided by operating activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows  million  is primarily related to changes in account balances of operating assets and liabilities 
other significant sources of cash included the march issuance of million of senior notes at a premium  with net proceeds to the company of million and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million at fiscal year end 
the disposition of the company s investment in onsite technology llc and the sale of property  plant and equipment provided proceeds of million and million  respectively 
debt repayments during the year included million which fully repaid the company s term loan and million borrowed under the company s revolving credit facility 
fiscal capital expenditures of million were the company s highest since  including new opportunities to invest significantly in barge and land based operations 
major barge rig projects included i the modification of barge rig re numbered  which after completion of operations in nigeria was transported to the us gulf coast where it underwent modification for service in the spring of in the caspian sea  ii the purchase of the gulf explorer barge rig  iii the conversion of barge rig from a workover rig into a drilling rig for work in the us gulf of mexico  and iv the construction of new barge rig for a contract in nigeria to begin in the summer of significant projects related to the company s land based operations included i the significant modification  including the conversion to an scr electric rig and installation of a top drive  of a helicopter transportable rig for service in bolivia  ii the modification of rig for service in kazakhstan near the aral sea  and iii the construction of scr electric rig for domestic service 
during the year a new facility was constructed for partech registered trademark  the company s manufacturing subsidiary  in new iberia  louisiana  where it has relocated from odessa  texas 
to finance the acquisitions of mallard  quail  bolifor and hercules and the capital expenditures noted above  the company has issued various debt instruments 
the company financed the november acquisitions of mallard and quail through the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes  series b due november and a million term loan under the senior credit facility 
in anticipation of funding the hercules acquisition  in july the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes bear interest at payable semi annually in february and august 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock of parker drilling company at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at the option of the company at any time after july at certain stipulated prices 
liquidity and capital resources continued in march  the company issued million of senior notes due november  series c at a premium yielding an effective interest rate of 
net proceeds after expenses were million  of which million was used to repay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan under the company s senior credit facility  which facility was previously used to finance a portion of the mallard and quail acquisitions of november the balance of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
all of the series b and c notes were exchanged for new series d notes  in may the form and terms were identical in all material respects 
the million revolving credit facility under the company s senior credit facility is available for working capital requirements  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
at august   million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million in letters of credit had been issued 
availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of supplies in inventory 
all advances to the company under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at the option of the company  at prime to prime plus or at to above the one  two  three and six month reserve adjusted libor rate  depending on the percentage of the credit facility utilized 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by a lien on the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  both the senior notes and the senior credit facility contain customary affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on incurrence of debt and sales of assets 
the senior credit facility prohibits  among other things  payment of dividends and the indenture for the senior notes restricts the payment of dividends 
management anticipates that working capital needs and funds required for capital spending in will be met from existing cash and other short term investments  cash provided by operations  prepayments received to offset construction expenditures as discussed below and from funds available under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company anticipates cash requirements for capital spending will be substantially less in calendar year anticipated million than in fiscal year million  although several of the company s fiscal construction projects will span both years  in particular the construction of barge rig for service in the caspian sea and barge rig for service in nigeria 
although the construction of barge rig requires significant capital spending in and  the company will receive prepayments from the operator to offset a substantial portion of the expenditures required to construct the rig 
as noted  management anticipates that capital spending in calendar year will be less than in due in part to the magnitude of such expenditures in fiscal and also due to the depressed drilling markets discussed previously 
should drilling markets improve to such an extent that new opportunities for investment in the company s rig fleet arise in excess of the company s available cash  the company may consider additional long term debt or equity financing 
other matters business risks internationally  the company specializes in drilling in remote locations and under difficult geological or operating conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by international and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
domestically  the company specializes in drilling deep wells in search of natural gas 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on domestic operations 
historically  due to the importance of oil revenue to most of the countries in which the company operates  the company s operations generally have not been negatively impacted by adverse economic and political conditions 
however  there can be no assurances that such conditions could not have a material adverse effect in the future 
year the company plans to achieve and maintain year compliance with a project consisting of seven phases 
the phases include awareness  inventory  assessment  detailed analysis  compliance testing  remediation and monitoring compliance 
prior to establishing the year project  the company made a decision to replace most of its outdated systems with state of the art integrated systems and standardized desktop systems 
the company spent much of replacing critical financial  human resources and payroll systems with new purchased software that is year certified by the information technology association of america 
the year problem was not the main reason for upgrading the information technology platform  however it will be beneficial in achieving year compliance 
the company has completed the initial awareness phase  inventory and assessment and partial testing of its core information technology systems 
the inventory and assessment of non information technology systems including telecommunication systems  business machines  security systems  premise equipment  rig equipment and other embedded chip technology is partially completed 
the company is surveying its critical supply chain and business partners to establish their state of readiness 
it is expected that all critical systems testing and necessary remediation will be completed by the end of the second quarter of calendar the remainder of calendar will be devoted to monitoring compliance  developing and testing contingency plans 
at this time no system replacement dates were accelerated because of the year problem 
the cost to date for the project have been in internal salaries and purchasing some testing software 
the software costs to date are not deemed material 
approximately  has been budgeted for the year project in fiscal year the company is confident that its critical business and operations systems will be ready for the year the greatest risks for year problems include local accounting systems used in some countries  the telecommunications utility infrastructures in many foreign countries and the vendor supply chain 
additional risks will be faced if key business partners  suppliers  banks  utilities  communications  transportation or government services are not compliant for the year in the event the company and or its suppliers and vendors are unable to remediate the year problem prior to january   operations of the company could be significantly impacted 
in order to mitigate this risk  the company is developing a contingency plan to continue operations should it become necessary to do so 
such procedures are expected to include alternative suppliers  communications  and transportation plans 
the contingency plan will be completed by the third quarter of calendar change in fiscal year on july   the company decided to change its fiscal year end from august to december  effective december  the company will file a quarterly report on form q with the securities and exchange commission covering the transition period of september  to december  indonesian operations the current political and currency instability in indonesia has created uncertainty regarding the company s indonesian operations 
the company provides management  technical and training support to an indonesian owned drilling contractor  whose services include the drilling of geothermal wells  related to power plant projects 
due to the uncertain economic conditions  certain of these power plant projects have been postponed or delayed 
as a result  payments from a significant customer for services provided by the indonesian contractor have been delayed 
the company and the indonesian contractor will vigorously pursue all alternatives to expedite payment 
the company believes that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
