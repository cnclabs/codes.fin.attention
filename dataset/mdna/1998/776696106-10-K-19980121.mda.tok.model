item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated 
amounts are dollars in thousands and percentages are of net sales 
year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings year ended october  industrial controls net sales    gross profit    operating profit    fluid handling net sales    gross profit    operating profit    analytical instrumentation net sales    gross profit    operating profit    includes results of metrix from september  includes results of petrotech from may  excludes any allocation of corporate administrative costs 
such costs were  in   in and  in includes results of fmi from may  includes results of uson from february  includes results of gatan from june  includes results of princeton from may  year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for of million represents the fifth consecutive year that the company has established a record high 
sales were million in the increased sales during were due mostly to the inclusion of the results of gatan and fmi for the entire year each of these companies was acquired during may and combined  contributed million of additional revenues and the inclusion of princeton and petrotech for part of each of these companies was acquired during may and combined  contributed million of sales in 
excluding these four companies  net sales for was approximately the same as metrix and uson each had very strong sales growth in in excess of primarily due to increased volume 
integrated designs reported decreased sales of about due to continued adverse conditions affecting the cyclical semiconductor equipment industry 
integrated design s sales continue to significantly trail the level reported during the first two quarters of isl reported sales about lower in compared to the largest reason for isl s decreased sales was the strengthened us dollar during relative to the french franc about  the functional currency for most of isl s sales 
another factor contributing to isl s lower sales was its restructuring which resulted in the disposal of small sales subsidiaries in the uk and brazil 
ccc also reported lower sales about in compared to ccc had significant sales to its primary customers in the cis  rao gazprom  and ukraine gazprom during million that exceeded comparable sales million 
both of these customers were unable to finalize their respective financing programs to make purchases at similar levels in net sales for the industrial controls segment up million  or increased mostly due to the inclusion of petrotech for the last five months of the increased sales at metrix was largely offset by a sales decline at ccc  where gains in the core business were more than offset by declines in the cis business as noted above 
net sales for the fluid handling segment up million  or increased mostly due to the inclusion of fmi for all of compared to only five months in the decrease in integrated designs sales was partially offset by higher sales at roper pump 
net sales for the analytical instrumentation segment up million  or increased mostly due to the inclusion of gatan for all of compared to the last five months of and the inclusion of princeton since its acquisition in may the increased sales reported by uson were largely offset by decreased sales by isl 
the increase in gross profit in million in compared to million in is also due mostly to gatan  fmi  princeton and petrotech which were acquired over the past two years 
excluding these companies  gross profit increased million in even though sales were relatively flat 
gross profit increased in each of the operating companies except for integrated designs and isl  whose decreases were directly related to decreased sales 
despite the drop in sales  ccc s gross profit improved due to a favorable product mix and certain cost reduction efforts 
industrial controls gross profit increased up million  or mostly due to the inclusion of petrotech million for the last five months of gross profit also increased at ccc million as discussed previously 
fluid handling gross profit increased up million  or mostly due to including fmi for a full year compared to only part of analytical instrumentation gross profit increased up million  or mostly due to the inclusion of gatan for all of compared to only part of million and the inclusion of princeton for the latter part of million 
the overall gross profit percentage in equals that of  despite the increased profitability mentioned earlier 
this is due to the acquisition of petrotech  whose typical gross profit percentage is significantly less than that of the company s other operating units 
excluding petrotech  the company would have reported consolidated gross profit of  or an increase of compared to this increase is mostly due to the product mix and cost improvements at ccc  whose gross margin percentage is up almost compared to and the high margins on increased sales at gatan full year vs 
partial year 
excluding petrotech  industrial controls would have reported gross profit of compared to in due to the improvements at ccc 
gross profit percentages in for the fluid handling and analytical instrumentation segments are each within about of the amounts reported in other than ccc  the gross profit percentages reported by each of the company s operating units are considered relatively comparable between and within 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  during compared to most of the increase million is due to the additional costs associated with those companies acquired during the past two years 
ccc also reported additional costs of million  mostly due to efforts over the past eighteen months to increase the infrastructure supporting the anticipated increased business with rao gazprom and other opportunities in the area 
sg a expenses for industrial controls increased up million  or mostly due to the additional costs reported at ccc and the inclusion of petrotech million 
sg a expenses for fluid handling increased up million  or mostly due to the full year vs 
partial year effects of fmi million 
sg a expenses for analytical instrumentation increased up million  or mostly due to the full year vs 
partial year effects of gatan million and the inclusion of princeton in million 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased costs at isl due to the benefits of the restructuring program executed early in and exchange rate fluctuations 
as a percentage of sales  consolidated sg a expenses was in compared to in most of the increase is due to higher research and development r d spending million in  of sales  compared to million in  of sales associated with the higher technology products at gatan and princeton 
these two companies account for million of the increase 
other r d spending increases reflect a continuing commitment to new product development at all companies 
selling expenses and administrative expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales less than as a result of volume leverage and cost containment programs 
interest expense increased million during compared to this increase is due to the full year effect of the additional borrowings used to finance most of the acquisition costs of gatan and fmi each acquired in may and the partial year effect of the acquisitions of princeton and petrotech 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in results from greater utilization of foreign sales corporation fsc benefits 
utilization of the company s fsc essentially results in income taxes on us export sales being at about one third of the us statutory rate 
the recently acquired gatan  princeton and petrotech all have significant export sales 
reflecting the foregoing  net earnings were million  or per common share  in compared to million  or per common share  in all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on august  bookings during million increased compared to million 
most of this increase is due to the impact of the companies acquired over the past two years million 
excluding these companies  bookings during increased compared to this increase is due to strength in the industrial controls segment up  mostly due to amot and metrix 
fluid handling and analytical instrumentation each reported slightly lower bookings in for those companies included in all of both and no individual company changed greater than 
on a pro forma basis to include gatan and fmi bookings since november  and princeton and petrotech bookings since the comparable date in as their acquisition date in  bookings are up in compared to sales order backlog was million and million at october  and  respectively 
most of the increase million represents the backlog at princeton and petrotech  which were acquired during on a pro forma basis to include these companies backlog at october   the backlog is greater than year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for of million were at record levels for the fourth consecutive year  reflecting an increase of over each of the company s business segments achieved double digit sales growth 
for the industrial controls segment net sales increased by million  or 
a increase in net sales from ccc  despite a modest increase in its business with rao gazprom  and the inclusion of metrix for a full year  were the primary contributors to the increase 
the ccc sales gains included the first significant orders shipped to customers other than rao gazprom in the cis following establishment of a significant local infrastructure 
also  ccc made significant gains in other international markets for processing plant compressor controls 
other contributors to sales gains within the industrial controls segment included favorable market conditions in certain of the core markets and incremental sales on new products 
the fluid handling segment experienced net sales gains of million  or  with the inclusion of fmi for five months and the continued growth from cornell pump and integrated designs 
this offset a decline in roper pump s net sales resulting from weak demand in the early quarters for rotary gear and progressive cavity pumps 
record first half sales at integrated designs were eroded by lower third and fourth quarter sales as a result of a cyclical decline in the semiconductor industry  but still showed a full year growth of from continued international market gains  particularly in asia 
the analytical instrumentation segment reported net sales increases of million  or  with the inclusion of gatan for five months and net sales gains at the other two businesses 
these sales gains were principally attributable to incremental sales on new products  expansion into the medical supplies testing market and international market expansion 
in  net sales to customers outside the united states represented of the total as compared to in the leading reasons for international sales growth were the acquisition of gatan which made of its sales outside the united states and increasing penetration of european and pacific rim markets through the existing roper infrastructure 
results of foreign operations were not significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in gross profit of million in increased by million over the same period in  while the gross margin decreased to from for this margin reduction was contributed to by similar margin impacts from both industrial controls and fluid handling segments as offset by improved margins in the analytical instrumentation segment 
the gross margin for the industrial controls segment declined to from 
this was largely attributable to more low margin  buy out products sold to rao gazprom and increased engineering and infrastructure costs supporting ccc s operations in the cis 
the gross margin for the fluid handling segment declined to from in  primarily due to lower margins at integrated designs caused by increased discounted sales to oem s and vendor price increases 
the margins at integrated designs returned close to historical levels for the last month of the fiscal year 
gross margins for the analytical instrumentation segment increased to from in reflecting the higher margin rates from the acquisition of gatan and margin improvements at isl and uson  both of which benefited from the leverage of additional volume  cost reduction efforts and price increases on products sold 
sg a expenses increased by million to million  an increase of 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales reduced to from in this reduction is attributable to the industrial controls segment where sg a expenses reduced to of sales in  from in  and was principally the result of lower r d costs at ccc where the series design was stabilized and from reduced bonus compensation in r d expenses were million in  an increase of million  reflecting the increased investment required in higher technology products throughout the company 
income from operations increased by million to million 
the operating margin declined to versus in in the industrial controls segment  operating profit before allocation of corporate administrative expenses increased by million to million  of sales  principally due to increased sales at ccc and the full year inclusion of metrix results 
operating profits before allocation of corporate administrative expenses of the fluid handling segment increased by million to million  of sales  with the inclusion of fmi offsetting margin related declines at integrated designs and volume related declines at roper pump 
the analytical instrumentation segment increased operating profits by to million  of sales  largely as a result of the acquisition of gatan 
interest expense increased by million  or  due to the additional borrowings for the acquisitions 
the decrease in other income results from lower royalties collected under a license fee agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was in as compared to in the effective tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate largely because of the favorable tax treatment afforded export sales attributed to its fsc and a lower state tax burden 
reflecting the foregoing  net earnings were million or per common share  in as compared to million or per common share  for bookings for increased by to million pro forma to include gatan  fmi  metrix and uson for 
sales order backlog was million and million at october  and  respectively  reflecting a increase in pro forma bookings in the fourth quarter 
this increase in bookings included a number of orders which totaled million from ukrainian gazprom 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations and credit available under its nationsbank credit agreement are the company s primary sources of short term liquidity 
in  the company generated million of cash from operations  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increased operating cash flow in principally resulted from higher earnings which were partially offset by additional investments in working capital 
working capital increased significantly million during to a total of million at october  most of the increase million is due to the working capital at october  of princeton  petrotech and ids  which were acquired during the year 
the major components of the increased working capital are accounts receivable million  million due to the acquisitions  inventories million  million due to the acquisitions  less current liability increases in accounts payable million  million due the acquisitions and accrued liabilities million  million due to the acquisitions 
an additional million of working capital at october  is invested in ccc accounts receivable and inventories compared to last year 
ccc has not collected certain receivables  primarily from rao gazprom  as anticipated and inventories were built up at october  in anticipation of sales to rao gazprom that have been delayed due to continuing financing issues 
the company anticipates that all receivables from rao gazprom will be collected and that rao gazprom will resolve its financing issues in fiscal further shipments to rao gazprom may also be affected by rao gazprom s ability to secure financing arrangements acceptable to the company and are subject to uncertainty as described below in outlook 
the acquisitions were financed primarily with long term debt and equity 
at october   approximately million of borrowings under the company s nationsbank credit facility was classified as current in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
during  this agreement was amended and restated such that there are no longer any interim pay down requirements 
capital expenditures in were million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
inclusion of gatan and fmi for a full year in and princeton and petrotech since their acquisition added approximately million of capital expenditures in compared to offsetting this increase was decreased spending at other companies 
the company believes that it can absorb anticipated sales growth without any significant expansion in manufacturing facilities  that capital requirements will generally be confined to ongoing replacement and upgrading of current machinery and facilities 
capital expenditures have historically not been very significant never greater than of sales in recent years and this trend is expected to continue in the approximate doubling of the company s cost for buildings is attributable to two buildings acquired pursuant to the acquisitions 
the increase in intangible assets reflects approximately million of additions for the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets acquired for the three companies that were acquired during princeton million  petrotech million and ids million 
the increase in other noncurrent assets and other noncurrent liabilities is primarily a reclassification within the balance sheet to separately reflect liabilities arising from insurable losses and the associated amounts receivable from the insurance companies 
the estimated total of insurable settlements and payments by insurance companies is approximately million 
in may the company amended and restated its nationsbank then existing credit agreement raising the borrowing capacity to million  up from million 
total borrowings under this agreement were approximately million at october  compared to approximately million at october  this increase in debt during resulted primarily from financing the acquisitions of princeton  petrotech and ids 
total cash acquisition costs were approximately million 
total debt to total capitalization was and at october  and  respectively  indicating in management s opinion a relatively modest level of financial leverage 
the slight increase in leverage is due to higher debt levels largely offset by the company s record earnings and the value of the company s common stock used to partially fund the acquisitions completed during the year 
at october  the company had million of additional borrowing capacity under its nationsbank credit agreement  the material terms and conditions of which are set out in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
most of the company s borrowings are libor based with maturities generally within days 
over longer terms  the company s interest expense is influenced by the volatility of financial markets 
interest costs are therefore subject to significant changes depending upon the movement of short term interest rates and other factors 
the company is exploring transactions that would reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
no such transactions have currently been entered into 
total stockholders equity increased by million to million  an increase of 
major components of this increase include current year net earnings of million and million of the company s common stock issued pursuant to acquisitions  and stock option exercises 
dividends paid on common stock were million in  an increase of compared to increased dividend payments are primarily the result of higher dividend rates per share in compared to quarterly rates in ranged from to higher than the comparable quarters in although the company has a history of paying dividends each quarter since its ipo in february and it has increased the dividend rate per share annually since  future dividends and rate changes are at the discretion of the company s board of directors and cannot be assured 
the company believes that internally generated cash flow and available unused credit facilities will continue to be adequate to fund normal operating requirements  capital expenditures  debt service costs and dividends 
however  the rate at which the company can reduce its debt in and the avoidance of associated interest expense will be significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of any financing requirements of any new acquisitions 
the company has generally been able to hold manufacturing and operating cost increases to levels which are at or below inflation levels 
it will continue its aggressive efforts to minimize increases in the prices it pays for materials and services and to implement cost reduction programs to offset the effects of inflation 
the company expects to continue to be successful in passing along any net cost increases to its customers 
outlook with incoming orders of about million for each of the last two quarters of fourth quarter bookings were about higher than the comparable quarter last year and a backlog of million  the company expects its three business segments to continue their growth in sales and earnings absent any material adverse change in the market and business conditions 
as previously announced  the company acquired ids on october  ids will be included in the company s analytical instrumentation segment 
effective december  the company acquired flow technology  formerly eg g flow technology  inc  which will be included in the company s fluid handling segment 
the annual sales of these two businesses prior to acquisition was approximately million in total and the company anticipates these acquisitions will have immediate favorable contributions to earnings 
the company also continues working to close another acquisition of a company that would become a part of its analytical instrumentation segment  as previously announced 
this transaction is currently undergoing review by the federal trade commission  which has delayed the earliest case timetable described in the company s third quarter form q 
it is also subject to final negotiation and execution of a purchase agreement 
pending satisfactory resolution of these contingencies  the company expects that it will be able to complete this transaction during the early part of calendar the company has been informed by rao gazprom that it will discontinue its efforts to obtain us export import bank guaranteed financing to fund equipment purchases under an existing turbomachinery controls equipment supply contract with ccc 
rao gazprom has expressed its continuing commitment to this supply contract and has indicated that funds will be made available in out of their general credit facilities 
however  in light of rao gazprom s past difficulties in carrying out its financing intentions  the company will proceed cautiously until it is reasonably assured that rao gazprom can fully fund its business with ccc at the levels and on the schedule provided for in the supply contract 
in the event that rao gazprom is unable to provide this assurance by mid year  the company may walk away from much or all of this opportunity because of the prohibitive cost of maintaining the infrastructure needed to support such sales 
additionally  such a circumstance may place collection of existing accounts receivable at risk 
see note and note of the company s consolidated financial statements in this regard 
the company believes that most year issues associated with its business systems and products have already been resolved and that there are no further significant costs associated with addressing any remaining matters 
the company expects to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and  unless otherwise indicated  it is not feasible to reasonably estimate when any such acquisitions will occur  what the financing requirements will be or what the impact will be on the company s activities  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board has issued several new accounting and reporting standards that are applicable to the company and will become effective at the company over the next several years 
the issues most applicable to the company include disclosures related to earnings per share reporting  comprehensive income reporting and business segment reporting 
once adopted  the information to be presented in accordance with these new standards is not expected to significantly affect the company s disclosures 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the specific new pronouncements 
forward looking information the information provided elsewhere in this report  in other company filings with the securities and exchange commission and in other press releases or public disclosures contains forward looking statements about the company s businesses and prospects as to which there are numerous risks and uncertainties which generally are beyond the company s control 
some of these risks include the level and timing of future business with rao gazprom  the integration and performance of ids and flow technology  the completion of any additional acquisitions and the impact money market volatility can have on the company s leveraged capital structure 
there is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on the company s future operations  financial condition or financial results
