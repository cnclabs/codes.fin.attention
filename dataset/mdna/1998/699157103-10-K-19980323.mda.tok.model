item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since  the company s primary focus has been exploratory drilling through the use of d seismic technology 
the company s long term business strategy is to increase the company s reserve base by utilizing d seismic technology 
the company intends to exploit its existing properties and acquire those properties which it believes can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
the company undertakes projects only when it believes the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
the company also endeavors to maximize the present value of its projects by accelerating production of its reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management 
as part of this business strategy  the company has acquired producing oil and gas properties in the permian basin of west texas and has discovered oil and gas reserves through the use of d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio wilcox gas trend onshore the gulf coast of texas 
capital utilized to acquire such reserves has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of the company s equity securities and cash flow from operations 
the company s operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices received for its oil and gas and the company s production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that the company receives for its oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices the company receives are primarily influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users and proximity of the company s wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructure and  to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing operating performance include production expenses  overhead requirements  and cost of capital 
the company s oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
accordingly  the company capitalizes all c osts incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
certain directly identifiable internal costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
such costs capitalized in  and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
depletion of such costs is provided using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was   and for  and  respectively 
costs from unproved properties are excluded from depletion until evaluated 
in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
results of operations the company s business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in reserve base  sources of production  product mix gas versus oil volumes and prices received by the company for its gas and oil 
consequently  year to year or other periodic comparisons of the company s results of operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe the company s condition

production costs 
production costs increased  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period of the decrease in production of  ebo and an overall increase in direct field operating expenses was responsible for the increase in production costs 
production costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily because of the decrease in oil and gas production volumes 
additionally  average production costs per ebo increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of as a result of decreased production volumes from the company s yegua frio wells drilled in at december   substantially all of the company s oil wells employed artificial lift pumping and have higher associated production costs than its gas wells  which flow 
as a result of its drilling efforts in the yegua frio wilcox gas trend during and  the company s production has become more weighted toward gas production 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the increase was primarily due to the company capitalizing less of its general and administrative expenses  increased public reporting costs and adding one additional employee

net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  operating cash flow increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net income and operating cash flow increases are primarily due to a increase in oil and gas revenues and  due to the company s low administrative cost structure  costs not increasing in proportion to the increase in revenues 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased million as of december  compared to december  current liabilities exceeded current assets by million at december   compared to current assets exceeding current liabilities by  at december  current assets increased primarily due to an increase of  in cash  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  current liabilities increased due to an increase in accounts payables of million  resulting from the company s increased drilling and seismic activities in the fourth quarter of the company and its bank lender are parties to a loan agreement which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
loans are made to the company under the revolving credit facility pursuant to a promissory note maturing july  the note is secured by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties and bears interest at the election of the company at a rate equal to i the bank s base lending rate or ii the bank s eurodollar rate plus a margin of 
on december   the interest rate in effect was the bank s base lending rate of 
commitment fees of 
per annum on the difference between the borrowing base and the average daily amount outstanding are due quarterly

the borrowing base reduces automatically each month at a rate of  the monthly reduction amount per month until april  the borrowing base and the monthly reduction amount are redetermined by the bank on or about april and october of each year or at such other times as the bank may elect 
at december   the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million 
the company intends to borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving credit facility from time to time as necessary  subject to borrowing base limitations  to fund d seismic surveys  lease option exercises and drilling activities on its properties in the yegua frio wilcox gas trend  developmental drilling on the company s permian basin properties  other drilling expenditures and acquisition opportunities and for general corporate purposes 
the loan agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements  including i the maintenance of certain financial ratios  ii limitations on additional indebtedness  and iii prohibiting the payment of dividends 
on december   the company consummated the sale of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share

proceeds received by the company  net of related expenses  were approximately  the net proceeds from the sale of the  shares of common stock were used to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
in august   and after drilling one marginal infill well in march   the company sold its interest in the north nena lucia unit  located in nolan county  texas  for approximately million 
however  the company retained all deep rights  being approximately  feet below the surfac the proceeds from the sale of the property were used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company incurred costs of million in its oil and gas property acquisition and development activities for the year ended december  such costs were financed by the utilization of working capital in addition to the sale of selected properties for million  net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million  which was attributable to a net increase in bank borrowings in the amount of million and net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the oil and gas industry is capital intensive 
the company makes  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the exploration  acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves 
historically  the company has financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and sales of equity securities 
the company s cash flow from operations and the continued availability of credit to it are subject to a number of variables  including the company s proved reserves and proved developed reserves  the level of oil and gas the company is able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and gas are sold and the company s ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  each of which can materially affect the borrowing base availability under the company s revolving credit facility  its only credit facility 
the company may from time to time seek additional financing  either in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of the company s securities or other forms of financing 
except for the company s revolving credit facility  the company has no agreements for any such financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
trends and prices the company s revenues  cash flows and borrowing capacity are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the markets for oil and gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and gas typically fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the company is unable to accurately predict domestic or worldwide political events or the effects of such other factors on the prices received by the company for its oil and gas 
the company historically has not entered into transactions to hedge against changes in oil and gas prices  but may elect to enter into hedging transactions in the future to protect against fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
during  the average sales price received by the company for its oil was approximately per bbl  as compared to in  while the average sales price for the company s gas was approximately per mcf in  as compared to per mcf in at march   the price received by the company for its oil production was approximately per bbl  while the price received by the company  at that same date  for its gas production was approximately per mcf 
information systems for the year the company will be required to modify its information systems in order to accurately process data referencing the year because of the importance of occurrence dates in the oil and gas industry  the consequences of not pursuing these modifications could significantly affect the company s ability to manage and report operating activities 
currently  the company plans to purchase software modifications from third parties in order to correct any existing deficiencies 
the total cost will be approximately  and the information systems are anticipated to be updated by the end of year issues as they relate to field operation programs  suppliers and contractors remain to be evaluated by the company 
however  based on current available information  the company does not anticipate that the costs associated with any necessary modifications will be material to the company s operations or financial condition 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s comparative results of operations
