the company generated million of cash from operating activities in and has generated an aggregate of million over the last three years 
during  the company received million in proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets 
the major uses of cash over the three year period have been to consummate the n o acquisition million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this amount  to purchase property  plant and equipment see below  to invest in interest bearing securities and to repay debt 
cash has also been used to pay dividends 
in  the company repaid million of bank debt and paid million in dividends

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s commitments to ponderay 
the company had million of available credit under its current bank credit agreement at december   however  it replaced this credit line under a new bank agreement obtained to finance the cowles merger see below 
the company also had an interest rate swap that effectively converted million of its debt to fixed rate debt at a rate of  which the company terminated upon the closing of the cowles merger  with no significant loss to the company 
a syndicate of banks and financial institutions have provided the debt financing of the cowles merger under a new bank credit agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of the following a term loan consisting of tranche a of million bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points  and will be payable in seven years  and tranche b of million bears interest at libor plus basis points and is payable in nine and one half years 
a revolving credit line of up to million bears interest at libor plus basis points and will be payable in seven years 
as the company reduces the outstanding debt relative to cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  the interest rate spread over libor will decline 
the debt is secured by certain assets of the company  and all of the debt is pre payable without penalty 
the company intends to accelerate payments on this debt as cash generation allows 
the definitive terms of the credit agreement include certain operating and financial restrictions  such as limits on the company s ability to incur additional debt  create liens  sell assets  engage in mergers  make investments and pay dividends 
while the company expects that most of its free cash flow generated from operations in and in the foreseeable future will be used to repay debt  management is of the opinion that operating cash flow and its credit facilities as described above are adequate to meet the liquidity needs of the company  including currently planned capital expenditures and other investments 
year compliance the company is currently in the process of addressing an issue that is facing all users of automated information systems 
the issue is that many computer systems process transactions based on two digits for the year of the transaction for example  for  rather than a full four digits 
these computer systems may not operate effectively when the last two digits become  as occurs on january  in some cases the new date will cause computers to stop operating  while in other cases incorrect output may result 
the issue could affect a wide variety of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers and communications systems 
a corporate task force is in place to assess the needed changes to the company s many different information systems and an implementation plan is expected to be completed in a dedicated year compliance coordinator will be named in early to ensure the company meets its own internal deadlines for compliance 
many of the necessary changes in computer instructional code are expected to be acquired during the course of normal upgrading of systems that are budgeted between now and the year  and in the course of normal maintenance 
other changes will necessitate re writing of computer instructional code  the majority of which is expected to occur in and the first half of at present  the company does not have an estimate of the total cost of evaluating and making required changes 
the costs incurred in addressing the year issue will be expensed as incurred  in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the project may also impact capital expenditure budgets  through increased expenditures for vendor supplied software and computer hardware 
forward looking information the preceding management discussion contains estimates and other forward looking statements covering subjects related to financial operating results 
these forward looking statements  and any other statements going beyond historical facts that mcclatchy management has discussed  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
these include changes in interest rates to be paid on the company s debt facilities  increases in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs over anticipated levels  competition from other forms of media in the company s principal markets  increased consolidation among major retailers in the company s newspaper markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  an economic downturn in the local economies of california s central valley  washington state  alaska  the carolinas or minnesota  or other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and classified advertising
