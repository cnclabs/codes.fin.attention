this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and associated notes 
this discussion includes the impact of the acquisition of ram optical instrumentation  inc roi and light control instruments  inc 
lci which were accounted for using the pooling of interests method and mikroprecision instruments  inc mikroprecision which was accounted for using the purchase method  as described more fully in note to the financial statements on page of this form k 
results of operations financial analysis the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percent of the company s net sales and as period to period percent increases or decreases period to period percent of net sales increase decrease net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income net sales for  and  the company s net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net sales for increased million compared with  with increases of million in domestic markets partially offset by a million decrease in international markets 
net sales for increased million compared with  represented by increases of million in domestic markets and million net of million unfavorable exchange rate effect in international markets 
domestic sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  sales increased million compared with the growth is primarily attributable to a million increase in sales to the semiconductor equipment  fiber optic communications and computer peripherals markets  sales growth totaling million to research customers and increases in page sales to other general metrology customers 
sales for increased million versus the increase was attributable principally to sales revenue at mikroprecision million for which there were no comparable amounts in and increases in sales of vibration isolation and precision motion systems to the semiconductor equipment  fiber optic communications and computer peripherals markets 
international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales in decreased million versus primarily due to the effect of the stronger us dollar  which negatively impacted the translation of european sales by million when compared with  and continued softness throughout most of the year in european research markets  particularly france and germany 
excluding the negative foreign exchange rate effects  european sales were approximately flat year to year 
pacific rim sales declined million in versus results in this region were mixed with sales to the hong kong and taiwan markets growing million while sales to japan and the asean countries declined million 
for  sales increased million versus and was attributable principally to increased sales into the fiber optic communication and computer peripherals markets in pacific rim countries million  offset partially by declines in europe million  primarily france where funding for research equipment was reduced  including the previously mentioned million unfavorable exchange rate effect 
the order rate in the us continues to show strength in response to the increasing sales and marketing emphasis on higher growth market niches in the fiber optic communications  semiconductor equipment and computer peripherals industries and on new products introduced in management expects improvements in sales in particularly in the united states and europe as the company continues to leverage its expertise in the design  manufacture and marketing of high precision components  instruments and integrated systems to the fiber optic communications  semiconductor equipment  computer peripherals and scientific research markets 
however  the continued strength of the us dollar against european currencies and the economic uncertainty in asia may offset in part the anticipated sales growth in those markets 
overall  management anticipates that net sales in will increase over  however  such growth is dependent on many factors and cannot be assured 
operating income total costs and expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in gross margin in from was attributable primarily to the higher growth rates in sales to oem customers in the company s target markets that generally have lower margins  but also lower sales and marketing expenses 
the decrease in gross margin in from was attributable primarily to the addition of sales of products manufactured by mikroprecision  which typically have lower margins than the company s other products 
management anticipates that  despite the expectation that sales to oem customers in the company s target markets will comprise an increasing proportion of the company s net sales  the company s overall gross margin will increase slightly in as a result of increased sales volume and continued manufacturing productivity improvements company wide 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in the respective years 
the million decrease in sg a in resulted primarily from favorable exchange rate effects in europe  decreases in advertising and other controllable expenses  delayed personnel replacement and the favorable effect on sales and marketing expenses from the mix shift toward oem customers 
excluding the million benefit of exchange rates  real sg a expenses increased million or less than over the increase million was attributable primarily to expenses incurred at mikroprecision for which there were no comparable expenses in million and to adverse determination of an appeal of litigation in france dating prior to the acquisition of micro controle sa million offset in part by a favorable exchange rate effect in europe of million 
management anticipates sg a expenses in total will increase in but will continue to decline as a percent of sales as a result of anticipated increased sales volume 
page research and development r d expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
r d expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increases in r d expenses in compared with and compared with  were attributable primarily to increased personnel costs related to the development of a number of new products and product enhancements some of which were to complement the autoalign fiber alignment system  including the orion semiautomated single mode fiber alignment system for the fiber optic communications market  improvements to the laserweld packaging workstation  development of laser diode burn in and characterization systems and new products and software by the company s roi and mikroprecision subsidiaries 
management is committed to continued product development and intends to maintain r d expenditures at a level between and of net sales for the development of new products and product improvements 
the company is dependent to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce innovative new products that gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in selecting  developing or manufacturing new products  or in enhancing its existing products so as to achieve such market acceptance 
operating income totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
operating income represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
management anticipates that operating income will improve in  both in total and as a percentage of net sales  primarily as a result of anticipated net sales growth exceeding expense growth 
interest expense interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense for over was primarily the result of additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of mikroprecision 
the company anticipates interest expense for will remain approximately the same as because its long term debt base will remain relatively constant until the th quarter when a million principal payment is due  and because the majority of the company s debt is at fixed interest rates 
other income expense  net interest and dividend income totaled million  million and million for the years  and respectively 
exchange losses were million in versus exchange gains of less than million in both and the company recorded investment gains totaling million in minimal investment gains were recorded in and no investment gains were recorded in taxes based on income the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared with was primarily the result of higher state income taxes  a lower utilization of foreign operating losses and no reduction in valuation allowance which were partially offset by a benefit from higher foreign sales corporation income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared with was primarily the result of lower utilization of state net operating losses nols and foreign operating losses and a lower valuation allowance reduction which were partially offset by a benefit from the conversion of foreign subsidiaries to us partnerships 
management anticipates that the company s effective tax rate in will be slightly higher than in employment worldwide employment of the company totaled  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in employment at december   was a result of the acquisition of mikroprecision and increased production to meet sales requirements 
sales per employee approximated   and  during  and  respectively 
stockholders equity stockholders equity increased from million per share as of december   to million per share as of december  and to million per share as of december  the increases in and were attributable to the respective year earnings and issuance of stock under stock option and purchase plans  offset in part by dividend payments  unrealized translation losses and repurchase of stock under the company s share page repurchase program in the company paid dividends totaling million  million  million during each of the years  and  respectively 
this represents cents per share for each year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributable to the company s operating income plus non cash items  principally depreciation and amortization  offset in part by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
inventories decreased in over levels as a result of programs introduced in to minimize inventory levels while maintaining competitive manufacturing lead times 
the company believes that it must maintain certain levels of inventory in order to ensure that the lead times to its customers remain competitive  however high levels of inventory increases the risk that the company will have to write down inventory in the future due to obsolescence if the company does not correctly anticipate market demand for certain of its products 
customer receivables remained at approximately the same level as in  while sales grew by 
accounts payable decreased in compared with in part as a result of reducing inventory levels and changes in the timing of material purchases 
net cash used in investing activities of million was attributable principally to the company s purchases of property  plant and equipment million and the final payment due on the acquisition of mikroprecision instruments million 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment aggregated million and million for and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities of million was attributable principally to the repurchase of stock under the company s share repurchase program  partially offset by the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and purchase plans 
in february  newport s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares under the company s share repurchase program which commenced in april this brings the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to  the originally authorized  shares were repurchased in at december   the company had in place a million unsecured line of credit with interest at prime  or libor plus and an unused line fee of basis points to support its domestic operation 
in addition  a million french franc million unsecured line of credit with interest at pibor plus was in place to support the company s european requirements 
both lines of credit were scheduled to mature on december  at december   there was no amount outstanding under the domestic unsecured line of credit with million available after considering outstanding letters of credit 
the amount outstanding under the company s million french franc million european unsecured line of credit was million french francs million 
in february the company modified its bank credit agreement increasing its overall unsecured line of credit to million to support the company s worldwide operations replacing the previous million domestic unsecured line of credit and million french franc unsecured line of credit 
this modified credit agreement retains the same interest rate prime or libor plus while reducing the unused line fee from basis points to basis points and extends the maturity of the line to december  the company believes its current working capital position together with estimated cash flows from operations and its existing financing availability are adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business at least through  including anticipated capital expenditures  debt payment requirements  and continuation of its share repurchase program 
although the company has no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material page acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies  the company continues to evaluate acquisitions of products  technologies or companies that complement the company s business and may make such acquisitions in the future  and there can be no assurance that the company will not need to obtain additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisitions 
additional factors that may affect future operating results the company s future operating results  and stock price  may be affected by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ from those stated herein 
these factors include the following rapid technological change  new product development the computer peripherals  semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications equipment markets  as well as the other markets for the company s products  are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements 
demand for certain of the company s products is dependent upon the market acceptance of the products manufactured by the company s customers  and there can be no assurance that such market acceptance will be achieved 
the company is also dependent to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to predict the needs of its customers and to develop and introduce innovative new products on a timely basis that gain market acceptance 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that meet its customers needs and achieve market acceptance could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company maintains an active development program to improve its product offerings  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely or cost effective basis 
risks of doing business in international markets in  and  international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s net sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result of conducting business internationally  the company is subject to various risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering its business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability and general trade restrictions 
in addition  due to various factors  including the difficulty of assessing the various political and economic factors that may affect the strength of foreign economies  it is often difficult to project demand for the company s products in foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the company s international sales and operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets  the us dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies as well as local costs and expenses of the company s foreign operations 
the company uses forward exchange contracts  and other risk management techniques  to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations relating to its intercompany transactions  however  its international subsidiaries remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
dependence on research budgets of customers a substantial amount of the company s net sales has historically been derived from sales of its products to page academic and governmental research institutions in the united states and various foreign countries  and the company anticipates that sales to such institutions will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales for the foreseeable future 
as such  the company s future performance is directly dependent in part upon the capital expenditure budgets of its research institution customers and the continued demand of such customers for the company s products 
many domestic and foreign research institutions  including certain of the company s customers  have experienced constraints on their capital expenditure budgets due to factors such as reduced governmental funding of research activities and reduced defense spending 
the company s operating results may in the future be subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of such funding constraints  and there can be no assurance that such constraints will not continue over time  or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
competition intense competition exists among manufacturers of precise motion  measurement and automation products  and the company believes that competition in the company s markets from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
the company competes principally in several specialized market segments against a limited number of companies  some of which are more established  enjoy higher name recognition and possess far greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company  while others are relatively small and highly specialized firms 
the company currently competes principally on the basis of the performance and quality of its products  including reliability  as well as on price and timely manufacture and delivery 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that new competitors  some of which may have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company  will not seek to enter the markets served by the company s products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not cause the company to reduce prices  which would negatively affect its gross margins 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers the company s ability to meet customer demand depends in part upon its ability to obtain adequate supplies of components from its vendors on a timely basis 
the company currently procures various components from single sources due to unique component designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements 
if such single sourced components were to become unavailable or were to become unavailable on terms satisfactory to the company  the company would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
if for any reason the company could not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  certain of the company s suppliers require long lead times to deliver requested quantities of components 
if the company were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components used in the manufacture of its products  resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could occur and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
fluctuations in operating results the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results will be  subject to fluctuations resulting from a number of factors  including the availability of government research funding  the demand for the products sold by the company s customers  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  variations in the mix of products sold by the company  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers  including possible decreases in average selling prices of the company s products in response to competitive pressures  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of the company s products  the availability and cost of key components  the availability of manufacturing capacity  and fluctuations in general economic conditions 
the company s overall gross margins may vary significantly on a period to period basis due to a number of factors including variations page in product mix 
in addition  competitive pressures may adversely affect gross margins 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain satisfactory gross margins 
the company also may choose to reduce prices or to increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities  all of which may adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters  which would likely result in a decline in the trading price of the common stock 
integration of acquisitions the company s recent growth primarily has been the result of strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
accordingly  the company s future operating results will be dependent on its ability to integrate various business operations in an effective manner 
the company intends to further broaden its product offering by designing and marketing complete systems comprised of components manufactured within its various operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in managing and integrating such business operations 
in addition  the company s acquisition related growth will continue to place additional demands on the company s management and resources 
impact of year certain of the company s business operations software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those software programs are time sensitive and recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company initiated a review of its business operations software requirements in early as part of the normal course of upgrading its systems to support current and anticipated growth 
among the criteria for acquiring new or upgraded software was that it be year compliant 
in the company acquired new operating software that is year compliant and is currently in the test and conversion phase  with implementation expected to be substantially complete by december  based upon the results of the work done to date  the company believes that the remaining work will be completed in a timely manner and that the overall cost of such work will not be material 
newport sells certain products that include various software applications 
currently the company is in the process of upgrading or otherwise ensuring that its product software is year compliant 
the company has also requested assurance from its goods and services providers that they are  or have programs in place to be  year compliant 
while the company currently believes that neither the software developed by it as part of its products nor the software licensed by it for its internal use will be materially affected by year problems  there can be no assurance that the company s product software  its internal computer systems and networks or those of its key vendors  developers and distributors will not be affected by such year issues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
pending adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 which is effective for years beginning after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in page interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore the company will adopt the new requirements effective with the filing of its annual report on form k for the year ended december  management has not completed its review of sfas no 
 but does expect that  while adoption of sfas no 
may result in more reported segments than are currently reported  it will not have an impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow
