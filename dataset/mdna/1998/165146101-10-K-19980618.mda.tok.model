item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s operating revenues are derived from two principal sources product development services and commercial production 
the company provides its customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with product development services  including experimental products for use in clinical trials  and manufacturing services for fda approved commercial drugs and medical devices on a contractual basis 
the company  which is currently expanding its commercial production capacity  has particular experience and expertise in the development and production of sterile  process sensitive biopharmaceutical products  and is iso certified 
the company s scientific and engineering staff perform multiple product development functions for cbl s customers  including research and development of sterile product formulations  test method development and validation  container closure system design  accelerated and on going product stability studies  process design and manufacturing validations  and regulatory and compliance consulting 
following final development of a stable formulation of the pharmaceutical product and validation of the manufacturing process  the company s production expertise is typically called upon to produce the development stage product for use in clinical trials or investigations as part of the fda approval process 
cbl produces and manufactures fda approved products for commercial sale by others 
the major commercial product manufactured by cbl during fiscal year was vitrax tm  an ha based product developed by the company and used in human ophthalmic surgery  for allergan botox  ltd  a subsidiary of allergan  inc allergan 
the previously extended contract manufacturing agreement for the manufacture of vitrax tm expired during the fiscal year and the last shipment of vitrax tm was made in september during the fiscal year ended march   the commercial production facility build out continued in the  square foot building purchased by the company in november  located in the carroll camden industrial park 
the company moved its executive and administrative staff and warehouse operation into the building in february  as the renovation of the pharmaceutical production area proceeded 
the commercial production facility was mechanically completed in december  and is currently undergoing start up and quality control testing to assure compliance with fda regulations 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company s revenues continued to be generated solely from its  square foot seton plant which is primarily a development products facility with limited commercial capacity 
the company incurred over  in expenses as the renovation of the new and larger facility progressed over the entire fiscal year 
these expenses include operating and maintenance costs  associated with the opening and pre production activity at the new facility and also includes net interest expense  on funds borrowed to finance the renovation 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues for the fiscal year ended march   were million compared to million for fiscal year despite this decrease  the company s fiscal year revenues were the second highest in the history of the company 
fiscal year revenues reflect the anticipated reduction in sales of vitrax tm to allergan  which amounted to  but this reduction was substantially offset by a increase in sales to other customers 
sales to allergan as a percentage of total sales were  and for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company secured new customers  accounting for sales of approximately million  during the fiscal year 
all operating revenues were generated by the company s existing experimental products facility  as renovation of the new pharmaceutical production facility progressed throughout fiscal year gross margin was of revenue for the fiscal year compared to for fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of costs related to the new facility  including the  in operating expenses as described in the overview section above and the decrease in revenues 
in addition  during late fiscal year  additional personnel were hired  initially to assist in start up and quality control testing associated with the new facility 
it is expected that once the facility is determined to be fda compliant  these personnel will perform production functions 
the additional personnel and the related expenses are necessary in anticipation of the company s need for trained and experienced pharmaceutical personnel  although the effort of these personnel did not contribute to the revenues in the current fiscal year 
operating expenses for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year the increase is  primarily  attributed to the addition of an experienced pharmaceutical industry marketing executive and the development and implementation of a multi faceted marketing  advertising and promotion program 
with more aggressive marketing  advertising and promotion  the company seeks to continue to expand its customer base 
as the company pursues opportunities for significant growth  management recognizes that receivable risks may increase and  consequently  has incurred operating expenses in fiscal year to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts above historical levels as of march  due to the compound effect of the increase in expenses and the decrease in total revenues  operating expenses were of revenues in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal year in summary  although the decrease in revenues contributed to the fiscal year operating loss  a substantial portion of the loss was a direct result of costs associated with the company s production capacity expansion and its increased marketing  advertising and promotion activities 
both of these undertakings are integral to the achievement by the company of its objective of increasing profitability by expanding its share of the market for product development and production services for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
other income includes both interest income on the  of net proceeds to the company from the follow on public offering of class a common stock  completed in june  and interest expense of  on the november loans to build out the commercial production facility

the strong growth in revenues for fiscal year was due to a increase in sales of vitrax tm to allergan and an increase in sales of product development services to new and existing customers

sales to allergan represented of the company s total revenue for fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year gross margin for fiscal year was of revenues compared to in fiscal year the decrease was due to expenses related to the expansion and relocation of the company s executive and administrative offices and warehouse to the new facility and the increased proportion of sales of vitrax tm  which has historically had a low margin 
operating expenses for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of approximately 
this increase was due to a full year of research and development expenses in fiscal year for a program that had been initiated in the second half of fiscal year  the salary of an additional executive officer hired in the first quarter of fiscal year and an increase in professional fees 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year interest income was  in fiscal year compared to  in interest expense in fiscal year this improvement was due primarily to the increase in cash flow from operations which eliminated the company s need to utilize available bank credit

the company paid  in cash and  shares of class a common stock for the land and existing improvements 
renovations to convert the building to a commercial production facility commenced during late fiscal year and continued through fiscal year the cash portion of the purchase price for the land and existing building  as well as the cost of the proposed renovations and a portion of the pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment and related pharmaceutical facility build out  was financed through the issuance of  variable rate economic development demand revenue bonds by the maryland industrial development financing authority midfa and a  loan from the mayor and city council of baltimore  acting through the department of housing and community development and the city of baltimore development corporation 
in addition  approximately  of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment was financed through equipment operating leases from companies affiliated with nationsbank  american equipment leasing a unit of european american bank  bancboston and corestates 
the bonds issued by midfa are variable rate  tax exempt  and are issued pursuant to a trust indenture 
the maximum annual interest rate provided for under the terms of the bonds is and  subject to certain conditions  the bonds may be converted to fixed rate at the option of the company 
however  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement and  as a result  the interest rate applicable to the bonds through november  is capped at 
as of may   the interest rate was 
the principal portion of the bonds  and the accrued interest thereon  is payable from monies drawn under a direct pay letter of credit issued by first union national bank of north carolina the bank  in amounts up to  interest is payable quarterly  commencing february   and principal portions of the bonds are subject to redemption  in part  commencing november  in accordance with a schedule set forth in the bonds 
the maturity date is august  the letter of credit is issued pursuant to a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement containing various terms and covenants applicable to the company 
the company s obligations in respect to the letter of credit and the bonds are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  including the new facility

the loan from the city of baltimore development corporation accrues interest at a fixed rate of per annum  amortized over twenty years with monthly interest only payments due through november  and monthly payments of principal and interest due thereafter through november the terms of the midfa bond financing and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  and corresponding regulations limit to  the aggregate amount of capital expenditures incurred by or attributable to the company within the city of baltimore during the six year period from november to november the code and corresponding regulations provide that capital expenditures made by others at the seton business park facility  including the landlord and other facility tenants  may accrue against the company s capital expenditure limit 
the company intends to manage its anticipated growth to avoid making capital expenditures which would cause the company to exceed the imposed limit 
for example  equipment obtained by the company through operating leases  which are not capital expenditures  would not accrue against the limit  nor would capital expenditures by the company on facilities outside of the jurisdictional limits of the city of baltimore 
nevertheless  the company may exceed the capital expenditure limit inadvertently or because it determines that to do so is in the best interest of the company 
in the event that the capital expenditure limit is exceeded  the company would be required to refinance the existing indebtedness through a taxable bond issue  conventional debt financing  or other means
