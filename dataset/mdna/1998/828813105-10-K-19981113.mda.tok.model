item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview simon transportation provides nationwide  predominantly temperature controlled truckload transportation for numerous major shippers 
in recent years  much of the company s growth has resulted from earning core carrier status with major shippers and meeting the demands of these shippers for additional equipment 
the company has grown to million in revenue for its fiscal year ended september   from million in revenue for fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of 
from fiscal through fiscal  the company s pretax earnings grew to million from million  a compounded annual growth rate of 
the increase in pretax earnings was attributable primarily to revenue growth  greater equipment productivity  and the reduction in financing costs attributable to public offerings in and during fiscal  the company continued its strong revenue growth  with revenue increasing approximately 
pretax earnings decreased substantially  however  as the company experienced financial and operating difficulties 
for much of the year the industry wide driver shortage contributed to a substantial number of unseated tractors 
to address this problem  the company raised driver wages by a total of four cents per mile 
although management believes the higher wages have made the company more competitive in attracting and retaining drivers  the combination of unproductive equipment and higher wages adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company s financial results also were affected by unusually high accident claims and repair expense during the second fiscal quarter 
since may of  the company has raised its freight rates to partially offset the increased wages  and the insurance and repair expenses have returned to historical levels 
going forward  management has deferred deliveries of new tractors to better match the anticipated availability of drivers 
this is expected to reduce revenue growth compared with historical levels  but improve profitability compared with fiscal in comparing the company s historical financial position and results of operations  readers should be aware of changes in financing methods 
during fiscal years and  the company financed most of its tractors and trailers with debt and capitalized leases 
during fiscal years  and  the company has financed most of this revenue equipment under operating lease arrangements 
financing equipment with operating leases increases the company s operating ratio because the implied interest component of the lease payments is reflected as an above the line operating expense rather than as interest expense 
the use of operating leases also affects the presentation of the statement of cash flows 
however  the method of financing does not affect net earnings or net cash flows 
the company s operating ratio may fluctuate from time to time based upon the method of equipment financing 
the company operated as an s corporation from october  to november  as a result  the company s net taxable earnings were taxed directly to the company s existing stockholders rather than to the company 
the pro forma statement of earnings data included in the selected financial and operating data set forth the company s net earnings for such periods as if the company had been subject to federal and state income taxes at a combined effective rate of for fiscal year  for fiscal year  and a combined effective rate of for fiscal years through in addition to the ongoing income tax effect  the termination of the company s s corporation status resulted in a one time  non cash charge of approximately million during fiscal year in recognition of deferred income taxes

inflation inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other truckload carriers 
seasonality the company experiences some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume  as shipments have historically decreased during the first calendar quarter 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
fuel availability and cost the company actively manages its fuel costs by requiring drivers to fuel at company terminals or  whenever possible en route  at service centers with which the company has established volume purchasing arrangements 
the company controls fuel purchases by using its proprietary software and qualcomm communications ability to schedule fueling stops and amounts purchased based upon fuel prices at locations on drivers routes 
the company historically has been able to pass through most increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of higher rates and fuel surcharges 
year compliance the company has completed a review of each of its core systems to determine year yk compliance 
the company s billing  dispatch  edi  fueling  payroll  telephone  vehicle maintenance  and yard and equipment inventory systems and all other critical hardware and software systems were designed to be yk compliant from inception 
the company is currently reviewing the yk compliance status of its facilities and equipment 
the company expects to complete this review and have taken actions toward making each non core system yk compliant by june the company relies on qualcomm to provide the satellite tracking system necessary to track the location of its equipment  and to provide dispatch and routing information to its drivers 
the company has been informed that the software utilized by qualcomm and the company is fully yk compliant 
the company utilizes comdata to transmit payroll funds to its drivers and to allow drivers to purchase fuel outside of the company s terminal locations 
the company has been informed that comdata expects to be fully yk compliant by june the company also interacts with many of its vendors through electronic data interchange edi 
although the company is yk compliant in its edi applications  we cannot and do not guarantee the yk compliance of our business partners systems 
the company has incurred internal staff costs necessary to review and further yk compliance of its core operating systems 
because the systems were designed to be yk compliant since inception  the costs have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company will incur additional internal staff time to complete its compliance review of non core systems embedded in facilities and equipment 
these non core systems include microcontrollers contained in tractor engines and other components  refrigeration units  and terminal facilities 
the costs of such review are not expected to be incremental since they represent the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
because of the relatively young age of its facilities and equipment  the company does not expect to find non core systems that need to be replaced to further yk compliance 
the company anticipates that the risks related to its core and non core systems will be mitigated by ongoing assessment and correction of the systems 
the primary risk to operations is service disruption from third party providers that supply satellite communication  telephone  fueling and financial services 
any disruption of these critical services would hinder the company s ability to receive  process and track its freight or communicate with its customers and drivers 
a failure of the satellite communication system could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is relying on the contingency plan established by qualcomm to prevent the interruption of business 
as an additional backup  the company plans to use its existing telephone systems to dispatch its equipment and provide support to its drivers in the event of a complete satellite system failure 
in the event of edi failures on the part of our customers  the company plans to use its telephone and facsimile system to receive load tenders from its customers 
the company would switch to paper invoices for its customers unable to use edi 
management believes that the company s current state of readiness  the nature of the company s business  and the availability of the contingency plans minimizes yk risks 
management does not foresee significant liability to third parties if the company s systems are not yk compliant 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recoverable 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to drivers or curtail the company s growth
