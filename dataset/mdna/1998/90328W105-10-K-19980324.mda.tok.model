the company sold the assets and operations formerly owned by prospect in november in april  the company acquired the assets of ams 
the stock of the cpi group and the stock and assets of usc europe were acquired in august and september  respectively 
the former mli and ams operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report and are included in metal services  which the company is actively attempting to sell 
results of operations in the third quarter  the company established a restructuring provision of million for plant closings and overhead cost reductions 
in the fourth quarter  the company  at the direction of its board of directors  employed the assistance of external business consultants to review operations and explore other avenues for enhancing shareholder value 
as a result of this review  the company established another restructuring provision of million primarily to include further personnel reductions and the reduction of asset value associated with equipment used in the businesses the company has exited or is in the process of exiting 
the key components of the restructurings include closure of the racine  wisconsin aerosol assembly plant  the midwest litho center in alsip  illinois  the sparrows point litho center in baltimore  maryland  and the california specialty plant in vernalis  california  a writedown to estimated proceeds of the sale of the orlando  florida machine shop plant and the baltimore  maryland specialty and paint distribution business  and organizational changes designed to reduce general overhead 
in july  sc johnson  a major aerosol can customer and principal customer of the racine plant  awarded all of its global aerosol business to a single supplier which is a us can competitor 
approximately million of annual sales will be affected due to the loss of this customer 
closure of the two litho plants and racine assembly plant is due to the loss of the sc johnson business and increased efficiencies at other plants 
the custom and specialty business of the california plant will be transferred to other locations 
as part of the business and operational realignments  the company has sold its steel pail business 
after the consolidation of the saddle brook operation  the company s steel pail business was conducted entirely from its north brunswick  new jersey facility 
substantially all of the assets of this business were sold in november for million plus the assumption of certain liabilities and future payments 
revenues of the steel pail business through october  were approximately million

 and revenues from these operations were million  million  and million excluding intra company sales which are expected to be continued by the buyer and including third party sales from the closed midwest litho plant  which other than sales to sc johnson have been transferred to other metal services plants 
the company anticipates that the sale of metal services will be completed in in aggregate  the company provided for a million million after income taxes loss on the sale of these two businesses  primarily representing the excess of recorded carrying value over the anticipated aggregate net sales proceeds for the net assets to be sold in the dispositions 
as of december   the net assets of metal services  excluding the discontinued operations reserve  included net current assets of approximately million and net other assets of approximately million 
the company continuously evaluates the composition of its various manufacturing facilities in light of current and expected market conditions and demand 
while no formal plans currently exist to further consolidate plant operations  such actions may be deemed appropriate in the future 
for further details on the restructuring provisions and the discontinued operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the steel pail and metal services businesses 
year ended december   as compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over the corresponding period in sales gains were the result of the company s acquisition of usc europe in september  and modest growth in domestic steel paint and oblong unit volumes 
the usc europe acquisition accounted for nearly of the total year to year increase 
gross income gross income of million was down million or from gross margin declined to in versus in competitive pricing pressure and increased steel costs compressed margins 
plant start up costs  primarily in europe  also adversely impacted gross income in operating income operating income in before the restructuring provision was million versus million last year 
lower gross margins adversely impacted operating income 
selling  general  and administrative expenses remained flat at of net sales through and including the impact of the million restructuring provision  the company reported operating income of million for due to the timing of the plant closings and other cost reduction actions included in the restructuring provision  no material benefit was realized in the results 
interest and other expenses interest expense on borrowings increased million in as compared to  due to increased borrowing  primarily to finance the company s acquisition of usc europe  and the refinancing of shorter term  lower rate bank debt with a portion of the proceeds of the notes issued in october other expenses were flat year to year as a percent of net sales 
net income loss net loss from continuing operations in was million or per share  versus net income of million or per share in the restructuring provision recorded in had a negative after tax effect of million or per share 
including the million  or per share  loss related to the divested steel pail business  and the million or per share loss on the discontinued metal service business  net loss for was million or per share  versus net income of million or per share including discontinued operations loss of million and extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of million after tax 
year ended december   as compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the corresponding period in companies acquired by us can during the first three quarters of  including usc europe  added approximately million to sales in the company has also realized additional sales as a result of the plastite and hunter acquisitions in and the cpi group and usc europe acquisitions in sales gains for the year also reflect volume growth in substantially all of the company s products 
gross income gross income of million for was million  or  higher than gross income for the acquisitions were the primary reason for this increase 
volume gains in with stable costs contributed to improved performance 
gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in despite a significant advance purchase of steel in late which resulted in the company not realizing the full impact of the steel price increase in the first quarter of in  margins  as well as sales  were negatively impacted by weak second half demand 
in  the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by the somewhat lower margins of acquired businesses and seasonality of the new european operations 
however  these were more than offset by improved sales and margins in core operations 
operating income the company s operating income of million for was million  or  higher than operating income for income was favorably impacted by increased sales  improved margins and the effect of an overhead reduction program begun in late operating income as a percent of net sales was for as compared to for the company experienced an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during  primarily due to acquisitions 
however  these expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in interest and other expenses interest expense on borrowings increased by approximately million in as compared to the increase is a result of increased borrowing  primarily to finance the company s acquisitions and the refinancing of shorter term bank debt with a portion of the proceeds of the million note issue in october amortization of deferred financing costs and other expense remained flat in as compared to the company believes more permanent long term capital is the most appropriate means to finance acquisitions  and  accordingly  issued the notes to repay short term acquisition debt  in addition to the notes 
as a result  repayment of lower cost  shorter term debt with the note proceeds has generated somewhat higher interest expense even though a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem higher cost notes 
net income for  income before discontinued operations and extraordinary item was million  more than three times the million reported in during  the company redeemed its notes with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
the early extinguishment of the notes resulted in an extraordinary charge of million net of income taxes of million primarily representing a prepayment premium and the write off of related unamortized deferred financing costs 
earnings per share before discontinued operations and extraordinary item were for the year 
final net income was million per share in compared to net income of million per share in liquidity and capital resources during the last three fiscal years  the company has met its liquidity needs primarily through internally generated cash flows  borrowings under its credit lines and proceeds of securities offerings 
principal liquidity needs have included operations  repayment of indebtedness and related interest  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
cash flow from operations has increased from million in to million in and million in  primarily due to improved working capital management in results also include million of payments related to the company s recent restructuring activities  including costs related to its discontinued operations

all of the notes were tendered in the exchange offer and  as a result  only the exchange notes remain outstanding 
in april  us can entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of banks the credit agreement  providing a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
in february  the revolving credit facility was reduced to million 
obligations under the credit agreement are secured by us can s domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
funds available under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including ongoing working capital needs and funds for permitted acquisitions 
the credit agreement has a five year maturity and amended and restated the april credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement permits the company to borrow funds available under the revolving credit facility in us dollars  british pounds or french francs 
the weighted average interest rate on this indebtedness at december  was 
as of december   the company s total debt was approximately million and scheduled principal payments excluding principal due on the revolving credit facility were approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years    and  respectively 
as of march   us can had borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement  million in letters of credit had been issued pursuant thereto and million of unused credit remained available thereunder 
primarily as a result of the special charges and discontinued operations  the company failed to comply with certain financial ratios  including total leverage  maximum domestic leverage and interest coverage  during the year and at year end 
the company obtained permanent waivers from the appropriate lenders and the company and such lenders have amended the credit agreement to better reflect the company s current configuration and expected operating results 
the company expects to remain in compliance with the amended financial ratios in the credit agreement through as of december   us can was in compliance with the credit agreement and its other long term debt agreements 
the company s capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in of the total capital expenditures in and  approximately million relates to the start up of the merthyr tydfil  uk plant 
in each year  these capital expenditures also included investments in new can production lines  paint can line enhancements  advanced lithography technology and computer integrated manufacturing  to increase manufacturing capacity  reduce changeover times and improve productivity 
the company has also invested capital in plant expansions and the installation of state of the art end making presses and automated packaging equipment 
the company expects to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures during the five years commencing in  in an amount of approximately million in and in roughly equal amounts of approximately to million in each year thereafter 
the company makes capital expenditures principally for improvements in the productivity and quality of lithography operations  continued technological enhancement of existing equipment  automation of existing processes  computer integrated manufacturing techniques  quality and service improvements  facility expansion  and  if necessary to meet demand  additional can making capacity 
the company s capital investments have historically yielded reduced operating costs and improved the company s profit margins  and management believes that the strategic deployment of capital will enable the company to improve its overall profitability by leveraging the economies of scale inherent in the manufacture of containers 
management believes that cash flow from operations  amounts available under its credit facilities and proceeds from equipment financings should provide sufficient funds for the company s short term and long term capital expenditure and debt amortization requirements  and other cash needs in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes it will be able to refinance the revolving credit facility on or prior to maturity 
if future strategic acquisition opportunities arise  the company would expect to finance them though some combination of cash  stock and or debt financing 
acquisitions during  the company acquired four businesses for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  plus contingent payments of up to million  and the assumption of approximately million in debt 
the cash portion of the purchase prices was financed primarily from borrowings under us can s revolving line of credit 
in april and june  the company acquired from alltrista corporation alltrista for approximately million and the assumption of a million liability substantially all of the assets other than steel inventory of alltrista metal services ams  a division of alltrista 
in june  the company purchased ams s remaining inventory for million

in addition  us can has made contingent payments  based upon the cpi group s financial performance during and  aggregating million 
this acquisition was financed with borrowings under a special acquisition line of credit provided to us can by its senior lenders 
in september  the company completed the acquisition of a portion of crown cork seal company  inc s crown s european aerosol can businesses usc europe for million  in addition to the assumption debt of million 
this acquisition included manufacturing operations in the united kingdom  france  spain and germany and the aerosol can manufacturing equipment and assets from a crown facility in italy 
the companies acquired and established in connection with the usc europe acquisition comprise the majority of the european subsidiaries 
the company incurred million of costs in completing this acquisition which have been included in total acquisition costs 
in january  the company acquired certain assets from owens illinois closure inc o i for cash consideration of million  subject to adjustment based upon the actual value of the inventory acquired and potential contingent payments of up to million based upon realization of certain new business which o i was seeking at the time of the acquisition

o i will operate these lines for up to one year  pending relocation into one or more of the company s plants 
the company will continue to evaluate and selectively pursue acquisitions which it believes are strategically important to meeting its customers needs  attracting new customers  adding new products  complementing its existing business and expanding its geographic reach 
environmental matters for a discussion of the san leandro  california environmental order  see legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and expenses in connection with this order 
the processes involved in the lithography and certain aspects of the manufacture of steel containers have historically involved the use and handling of materials now classified as hazardous substances under various laws 
these activities described above may expose owners and operators of facilities involved in those activities to potential liability for the cost to clean up or remedy any environmental contamination resulting from such substances relating to those businesses 
as of december   the company s reserves for future ascertainable costs of environmental remediation in the united states were approximately  management does not believe that such costs  if any  in excess of the reserve will have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in making this assessment  the company considered all information available to it including its and other companies reported prior experience in dealing with such matters  data released by the epa and reports by independent environmental consultants regarding certain matters 
it is possible that the company s insurance coverage may extend to certain environmental liabilities  but the company has not been able to estimate such coverage due to the complexity and uncertainty inherent in such an estimate 
in addition  the company has obtained indemnities against certain liabilities in connection with its recent acquisitions 
however  the statements related to environmental liabilities made by the company in this report are made without regard to any potential insurance recovery or recovery of amounts from indemnitors 
a variety of propellants are used in the company s principal product  aerosol cans 
these propellants include hydrocarbons  compressed gases for example  carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide  and volatile organic compounds such as propane  butane and isobutane individually  voc and collectively vocs 
some united states and european regulations have caused consumer product manufacturers the company s customers to reformulate either their products  the propellants used therein or both if they contain vocs 
to date  most of the company s customers have been successful in reformulating both their products and propellants 
however  there can be no assurance that all customers will be able to effect such reformulations or future reformulations  if any  in either products or propellants with satisfactory results 
if customers are unable to do so  this could have an adverse effect on the market for aerosol cans 
usc europe includes five aerosol can making operations located in the united kingdom  france  spain  germany and italy 
the company has retained an independent environmental consultant to perform an initial environmental inventory  and the seller provided disclosure on environmental matters relating to each plant and site 
the company has also performed its own audit of plant operations and facilities 
in connection with this acquisition and with the company audit  no subsurface sampling was performed to identify possible contamination 
several of the facilities have been operating at their locations for more than ten years and  according to a survey conducted by an independent environmental consultant  it is likely there have been releases of hazardous substances at these locations in the past 
the operation in southall  uk and schwedt  germany are in historically industrialized areas  and there is potential for area wide contamination involving adjacent sites 
there can be no assurance that there are not significant environmental liabilities unknown to the company 
the company has made  and expects to continue to make  significant capital expenditures to upgrade its facilities in accordance with current and pending environmental regulations 
the company received a request for information from the us epa in january  concerning the lithography operations at its chicago facility formerly owned by alltrista 
in march  representatives of the us epa inspected the chicago facility and requested additional information  including compliance tests and reports 
the company has cooperated fully with the us epa inquiry 
the company does not know what the outcome of this inquiry will be 
in the acquisition agreement between the company and alltrista  alltrista agreed to indemnify the company for compliance costs that relate back to alltrista s operation of this facility 
as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites in the us  the company is or may be legally responsible  jointly and severally with the other members of the prp group  for the cost of remediation of these sites 
based on currently available data including epa data  internal records and other sources believed to be reliable  the company believes its contribution  and or the contribution of its predecessors  to these sites was de minimis 
based on the information available as of the date of this report  management does not believe that its aggregate remediation costs or potential liabilities in connection with these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the other prp s will pay their proportionate share of the remediation costs at these sites and  as a result  future costs or liabilities incurred by the company could be material 
seasonality the company s business as a whole is not affected to any significant degree by seasonal variations  although quarterly sales and earnings tend to be slightly stronger starting in early spring second quarter and extending through late summer third quarter 
aerosol sales do not tend to fluctuate during the year  with only relatively minor spring and summer increases related to household products and insect repellents 
paint sales tend to be stronger in spring and early summer due to the favorable weather conditions 
portions of the custom and specialty products line tend to vary seasonally  because of holiday sales late in the year 
interest rates foreign currency management does not believe that interest rate fluctuations have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   of the company s borrowings were floating rate obligations 
in the past  management has adopted strategies to increase the company s floating rate exposure to benefit from declining rates 
currently  the company holds no interest rate swaps 
however  in an effort to limit foreign exchange risk related to the financing of the merthyr tydfil facility  the company has entered into a series of british pound dollar forward contracts that will not exceed million in notional amount or a term of more than seven years 
the indenture under which the notes were issued limits the company s ability to enter into currency hedging transactions that would be considered speculative  but the company is specifically permitted to hedge payment obligations on indebtedness permitted by the indenture 
to the extent that the company obtains financing in united states dollars and receives revenues and incurs expenses in the development  construction and operation of usc europe in its local currencies  the company will encounter currency exchange rate risks 
while the company may consider entering into transactions to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that the company will engage in such transactions  or  if the company decides to engage in such transactions  that shifts in the currency exchange rates will not have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or its ability to repay principal or interest on its debt obligations 
inflation historically  the company has not always been able to immediately offset increases in tin plate prices with price increases on the company s products 
however  in most years  a combination of factors has permitted the company to improve its profitability notwithstanding these conditions 
the company s capital spending programs and manufacturing process upgrades have increased operating efficiencies and thereby reduced the company s unit cost of production 
in addition  historically  the company has been able to negotiate lower price increases than those announced by its major suppliers 
see business raw materials 
the operating efficiencies and reduced unit cost of production which have been achieved through the company s capital spending programs have mitigated the impact of inflation on the company s cost structure 
in and  higher material costs were one of the factors contributing to the company s reported earnings 
customer relationships aerosol containers aerosol containers accounted for of the company s total net sales for the year ended december  a significant reduction in the number of aerosol containers used by the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company and  in particular  its european operations which are comprised solely of aerosol manufacturing facilities 
in october  us can received written confirmation of gillette s intention to purchase certain annual unit volumes of aerosol cans from us can  including us can s european operations  through  with the option to extend for an additional period  subject to price adjustment for actual volumes purchased 
the company s manufacturing facility in merthyr tydfil  in which the company has invested approximately million  was opened in large part due to gillette s decision 
the loss of gillette as a customer or a material reduction in the benefits to the company expected under this arrangement would have an adverse impact on the profitability of that facility and the company s ability to recoup the start up costs of establishing the facility 
it is not us can s policy to have any plant devoted exclusively to one customer and management plans to service other customers from this facility 
the company s relationships with its customers are critical to its business 
a significant portion of the company s annual net sales is attributable to repeat customers 
the loss of a significant number of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
year us can is currently in the process of converting from an ibm mainframe legacy system to an integrated as software package from american software  that is year compliant 
order entry and accounts receivable functions have been converted to the as based system  and general ledger and accounts payable functions are scheduled for conversion no later than the third quarter of in addition  several plant manufacturing operating and data base management systems are being upgraded to year compliance at a minimal cost 
the company has also surveyed its primary vendors which have indicated they will be year compliant 
the company has also reviewed certain telephone  time and attendance  voice mail  and programmable logic control systems 
the company believes it will be year compliant in advance of the new millennium  and does not believe the compliance costs will be material
