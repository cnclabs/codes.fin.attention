matters discussed below should be read in conjunction with statements of operations data and operating data convenience stores only on the preceding pages 
the company experienced a significant loss of million in fiscal year this loss includes a charge of million net of tax of  as a result of the change in method of accounting for inventory  a pre tax charge of million relating to the termination of getty leases  and a pre tax charge of million for the impairment of long lived assets 
before the effect of these charges  the loss from operations was million on a pre tax basis  or million after tax 
the loss from operations is attributable primarily to significant declines in gross profit rates on the sale of gasoline products and merchandise sales 
in addition  the company s selling expenses increased primarily as a result of higher labor costs associated with the staffing of branded fast food units within its convenience stores 
depreciation  amortization and interest expenses also increased due to the costs of new and remodeled stores and upgrading stores for fast food installations 
the company had expected fast food installations would result in enhanced revenues which would offset these expenses 
however  the anticipated increase in revenue has not been realized to date 
the company recently entered into an agreement with getty pursuant to which getty has agreed  among other things  to purchase certain store equipment and gasoline equipment for million 
the company intends to use a portion of these proceeds to repay million of its outstanding senior debt 
as a result of the termination of the getty leases  the number of stores operated by the company will be reduced by  which were previously leased to the company by getty 
in addition  the company will no longer be required to purchase petroleum products from getty 
in fiscal year  these stores generated merchandise sales of million and sold million gallons of gasoline  for total sales of million 
termination of the relationship with getty will permit the company to purchase petroleum products from a variety of competing sources 
the company has recently entered into agreements to purchase branded gasoline for locations 
the company will purchase unbranded gasoline from various sources for locations 
these arrangements should provide for purchases of gasoline at cost levels which are less than those offered by getty 
the company believes that the agreements it has already entered into to purchase gasoline as well as its ability to purchase petroleum products from a number of competing sources will enable it to improve gasoline margins 
however  gasoline margins have historically been volatile and there can be no assurance that the company s gasoline margins will be enhanced by purchasing such products from competitive sources 
in addition  the company has suspended its program of capital expenditures for fast food installations and currently does not anticipate adding any such new installations in the near future 
the company expects to improve the operating results of its existing fast food units

while the company expects to sell more gallons per store as it continues to implement its strategy of adding high volume gasoline dispensing facilities  the price of gasoline can be volatile  and there can be no assurance that an increase in sales volume will result in higher revenues or gross profits 
however  the company expects that total gallons of gasoline sold in fiscal year will decline due to the loss of gasoline locations leased from getty 
in fiscal year  the locations leased from getty sold million gallons of gasoline 
average merchandise sales per store  for stores open two full years  have increased from approximately  in fiscal year to approximately  in fiscal year to approximately  in fiscal year this merchandise sales growth trend is primarily the result of increased sales of branded fast food items and the addition of in store traffic enhancing services  such as the sale of lottery tickets  money orders and prepaid telephone cards  the acceptance of utility bill payments  atms and free check cashing 
tobacco sales represented approximately of total merchandise sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
there has been volatility in selling prices as a result of competition among cigarette manufacturers 
since the company expects this volatility to continue  it has sought increased sales of other merchandise to offset the uncertainty in cigarette sales 
convenience stores selling gasoline have been heavily affected by environmental regulations principally concerning underground storage tanks  which require large capital expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
in the late s  the company began making significant expenditures to meet  and exceed  applicable standards 
management believes that the company is currently in compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and expects to expend approximately million in fiscal year to maintain compliance 
in addition  the company has adopted a program to ensure that new gasoline installations comply with federal and state regulations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain expense items to total revenues 
since the company s franchise agreements for of the company s franchise locations permit the company to exercise complete control over the operations of these franchised stores and the company bears the attendant risks of ownership  the results of operations include sales and related cost of sales of stores operated by these franchisees 
it should be noted that the primary factors influencing the percentage relationship of cost of sales to revenues are the volatility of gasoline prices and the proportional increase in the number of stores selling gasoline 
on a percentage basis  the gross profit on gasoline sales is significantly less than the gross profit on merchandise sold in the convenience stores

liquidity and capital resources most of the company s sales are for cash and its inventory turns over rapidly 
as a result  the company s daily operations do not generally require large amounts of working capital 
from time to time  the company utilizes substantial portions of its cash and interim credit facilities to acquire and construct new stores and renovate existing locations 
in addition  the company periodically utilizes credit facilities for working capital as it did during fiscal year at september   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in both its senior note agreements and its bank term loans and revolving credit agreement 
this noncompliance resulted primarily from lower gross profits on merchandise and gasoline sales as well as lower than anticipated profit contributions from newly constructed and remodeled stores during fiscal year the senior notes had an outstanding balance of  at september  the agreements related to these notes had previously been amended in january  april and july to waive covenant noncompliance by amending certain covenants and the scheduled amortization of the notes 
the agreements related to these notes were further amended by the holders in december to waive covenant noncompliance for the fiscal quarter ended september  and the first fiscal quarter ending january  in consideration of the december amendment  the company has agreed to repay the remaining  of outstanding principal on february  the bank term loans and revolving credit agreement were amended on december  to waive covenant noncompliance for the fiscal quarter ended september   modify certain existing covenants and add new covenants effective on the amendment date 
the new schedule of term loan principal payments beginning on february   requires quarterly payments of  through october  and  through october   with the remaining balance due on december  in addition  the company must make mandatory prepayments if specified cash flow targets are met or if the company receives proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
the rate of interest paid by the company to the banks for the revolving credit loan was increased by 
per annum 
in addition  the amendment restricts the company s capital expenditures to million in fiscal year and places certain restrictions on any additional borrowing by the company 
as a result of the amendments discussed above  the company has debt service requirements for fiscal year of million  a significant increase from requirements in prior years 
as of september   the company had cash balances of approximately million but had no additional borrowing available under its existing credit agreements 
the company expects to utilize approximately million in proceeds from tax refunds and asset disposals for a portion of the debt service requirements 
management believes these sources of cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its obligations in fiscal year impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  increases in the company s cost of merchandise can be quickly reflected in higher prices of goods sold 
however  the upward movement of gasoline costs may have short term negative effects on profit margins  since the company s ability to raise gasoline prices can be limited due to competition from other self service gasoline outlets 
in addition  fluctuation of gasoline prices can limit the ability of the company to maintain stable gross margins
