item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general emisphere is a drug delivery company focused on the discovery and application of proprietary synthetic chemical compounds that enable the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since its inception in  the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to research and development conducted on its own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
the company has no product sales to date 
the major sources of the company s working capital has been proceeds from its initial public offering in  a second public offering in  a third public offering in  private equity financing  issuance to an affiliate of elan corporation plc of stock and warrants in and subsequent exercise of the warrants in april  reimbursement of expenses and other payments from corporate partners  the registered sale of one million shares of common stock to two institutional investors in  the issuance on may  of three year   aggregate principal  senior convertible notes  and income earned on the investment of available funds 
the company s operations are not significantly affected by inflation or seasonality 
in december  the company and novartis pharma ag novartis entered into a research collaboration to investigate the company s technology for oral delivery of two selected novartis compounds 
the agreement with novartis provides for an initial research collaboration period of at least months and the option on the part of novartis to acquire an exclusive license to use the company s technologies for the development and commercialization of an oral formulation of the novartis compounds 
in march  eli lilly co 
lilly and emisphere executed two license agreements granting lilly the right to use emisphere s technologies in connection with the oral formulation of two of lilly s therapeutic proteins the subject proteins in the areas of osteoporosis and endocrinology including growth disorders 
as a result  lilly made two milestone payments to emisphere 
the license agreements provide that lilly is obligated to seek to market the oral formulations of the subject proteins and that emisphere is obligated to provide a material portion of the supply of carrier necessary for the production of any such formulation 
in may  emisphere initiated on behalf of ebbisham limited ebbisham  a joint venture between emisphere and elan corporation plc  a phase ii clinical trial for ebbisham s oral heparin product 
prior to initiating the phase ii trial  emisphere had completed six single dosings and two multiple dosing phase i trials 
the phase i trials demonstrated that the oral heparin was well tolerated and retained the properties observed in the pre clinical models 
the phase ii trial was designed with three arms of approximately forty patients each who have undergone surgery for hip replacement 
two different doses of the oral heparin formulation will be compared to subcutaneously administered heparin 
the objective of the study is to demonstrate that orally administered heparin utilizing emisphere s proprietary technology is well tolerated and comparable to subcutaneous heparin in preventing deep venous thrombosis 
the results of the phase ii trial are expected sometime before january  results of operations the company has since its inception generated significant losses from operations 
the company does not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future 
profitability will ultimately depend on the company s ability to develop its lead products in conjunction with ebbisham  lilly  and novartis  or to develop other products in conjunction with other partners 
there can be no assurance that the development will be completed or if completed  any regulatory agency will approve the final product 
even if final products are developed and approved  there is no assurance that sales will be sufficient to achieve profitability 
if development of such products is not achieved or approval not granted  the company s prospects will be materially affected 
the ability of the company to reduce its operating losses in the near term will be dependent upon  among other things  its ability to attract new pharmaceutical and other companies who are willing to provide funding to the company for a portion of the company s research and development with respect to specific projects 
while the company is constantly engaged in discussions with pharmaceutical and other companies  there can be no assurance that the company will enter into any additional agreements or that the agreements will provided research and development revenues to the company 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s contract research revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal such increase was the result of the company performing additional services on behalf of its collaborators 
revenues in fiscal consisted of recognition of  from ebbisham   from lilly and  from novartis 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended july  increased by  or  as compared to fiscal the details of the increase are as follows research and development costs increased by approximately  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is mainly attributable to increased personnel and laboratory supply costs in connection with the collaborations with lilly  novartis and the ongoing clinical work for heparin

the company believes that this level of research and development spending will continue for the foreseeable future and may increase if operations are expanded

the costs associated with ebbisham may increase substantially depending upon the agreed timing and scope of future research and development efforts

the company also experienced an increase in rent expense in connection with payments for a new lease for administrative office space and an increase in personnel and related expenses associated with an increase in administrative staff positions 
this was partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees paid in connection with the finalization of the ebbisham joint venture and the agreement with lilly during fiscal in connection with the relocation of its operations  the company incurred a charge of approximately  which represented the write down of leasehold improvements on its old facility

in august  the company loaned ebbisham ltd 
 to cover past costs incurred by ebbisham ltd 
the company expects the research funding received from lilly and novartis to approximate the costs to be incurred by the company in connection with the development of each of the company s projects 
see collaboration agreements under present operating assumptions  the company expects that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital requirements through fiscal thereafter  the company would need to seek additional funds  primarily in the public and private equity markets and  to the extent necessary and available  through debt financing 
the company has no firm agreements with respect to any additional financing and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds were not available  the company would be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs  or obtain funds  if available  through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
the company does not maintain any credit lines with financial institutions 
year compliance the year problem relates to many currently installed computers  software  and other equipment that relies on embedded technology collectively  business systems 
these business systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than two years  business systems used by many companies  in a very wide variety of applications  will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified  upgraded  or replaced to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
if a business system used by the company or a third party dealing with the company fails because of the inability of the business system to properly read a st century date  the results could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year business systems failures and has established a team to address year risk 
the team is reviewing the company internal infrastructure and believes that it has identified substantially all of the major business systems used in connection with its internal operations 
the company has commenced the process of identifying and correcting the major business systems that may need to be modified  upgraded  or replaced  and expects to complete this process  along with remedial actions before the end of fiscal costs incurred to date to correct year problems have been immaterial 
the company estimates the total cost to complete any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of affected business systems will not have a material impact on the company s business or results of operations 
this estimate is being monitored and will be revised  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the company also recognizes the risk that suppliers of products  services  and collaborators with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis may not comply with year requirements 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant suppliers and collaborators to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable if these third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
the review is ongoing and the company is unable to determine  at this time  the probability that any material supplier or collaborator will not be able to correct any year problem in a timely manner 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services  or continue the collaborations with the company  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
based on the above  the company has yet to develop a comprehensive contingency plan with respect to the year problem 
the company will continue to monitor its own business systems and  to the extent possible  evaluate the business systems of its third party suppliers and collaborators to ensure progress on this critical matter 
however  if the company identifies significant risk related to the year compliance or progress deviates from anticipated timelines  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
the discussion of the company s efforts  estimates  and conclusions herein contain forward looking statements and are based on managements best estimates of future events 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of modifications  our ability to discover and correct the potential year problem  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review
