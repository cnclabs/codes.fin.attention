consolidated revenues increased in as compared to and in as compared to the increase in consolidated revenues in is primarily due to a increase in revenues from advanced messaging services resulting  in large part  from sales of skyword plus units  an advanced text messaging service with guaranteed delivery which was introduced by the company in april the number of advanced messaging units in service increased in as compared to and increased in as compared to revenues from one way messaging operations in the united states increased in as compared to and in as compared to these increases in revenues were primarily attributable to increases in the number of one way paging and voice messaging units in service in the united states which increased in as compared to and in as compared to net unit additions on the one way messaging network decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of the emphasis by the company s direct sales force on the sale of advanced messaging services and the migration of nationwide alphanumeric one way paging customers to the more efficient advanced messaging network 
approximately of skyword plus sales in were upgrades from skytel one way services 
overall average revenue per domestic unit in service decreased slightly to in as compared to in average revenue per one way messaging unit in service was in as compared to in  and average revenue per advanced messaging unit declined to in from in the company cannot predict future trends in average revenue per unit because of limited experience with usage charges from advanced messaging services and the planned introduction of new value added services in in  the company intends to continue to emphasize the distribution of its family of advanced messaging services  including skyword plus  two way interactive messaging and fixed location services 
the advanced messaging network provides the company with the opportunity to place a substantially higher number of units in service because of significantly increased network capacity due to higher transmission speed and spectrum reuse 
this increased capacity should permit the company to achieve improved cash flow from operations on an incremental basis at such time as the company places a sufficient number of advanced messaging units in service to cover the fixed costs of the advanced messaging network and operating costs decline as a percentage of revenues 
the company also intends to continue to feature its one way services through the promotion of products and services which more efficiently utilize the capacity of the flex enabled one way messaging network  such as the beepwear pager watch and prepaid paging services  and the establishment of distribution channels which can effectively market these products and services 
the ability of the company to continue to achieve improved operating results will be dependent on the continued improved performance of its direct and reseller distribution channels  the success of new distribution channels and the timely availability and market acceptance of new products and value added services which the company expects to introduce on the one way messaging network and the advanced messaging network in in addition  the company cannot predict the extent to which competitive advanced messaging services will be available in  if at all

in addition  operating expenses during and future periods will reflect monthly rental expenses recorded in connection with operating lease agreements entered into with motorola inc motorola in the third and fourth quarters of pursuant to which the company leased a total of  skyword plus units valued at approximately million
