counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
such agreements are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s debt portfolio is managed to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate obligations 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to help maintain the overall interest rate parameters set by management 
as a result of this interest rate mix  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or the fair values of its market risk sensitive financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts or uses other hedging strategies to substantially limit its exposure to changes in foreign currency rates  primarily the deutschemark 
as such  changes in currency rates would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations
