these compare to returns on average equity of and and returns on average assets of and for and  respectively 
total assets decreased slightly from billion in to billion in loans receivable increased by million  largely due to the continued emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents which was attributable to higher than usual deposits left on hand by governmental agencies at december  total deposits were billion at december  compared with billion at december  the increase in earnings during compared to was primarily attributable to a higher level of interest earning assets as well as an increase in the net yield from to 
these combined factors resulted in an increase in net interest income of million to million for noninterest income totaled million for up from million for commissions from insurance sales  which commenced with the may acquisition of the pomerleau agency  were million in credit card and merchant servicing income increased  to million in service charges on deposit accounts increased  to million and trust income increased  to million in mortgage servicing income declined slightly in as a result of increased amortization expense related to originated mortgage servicing rights 
gains on sales of mortgages decreased to million in  compared to million in due to decreased market activity 
noninterest expense totaled million in  up million from the level 
salaries increased million from million in employee benefits increased by million to million in the increase in salaries and benefits during was primarily due to higher staffing levels and related recruitment expenses 
fdic insurance premiums totaled  up from  in included in the increases of the various noninterest expense categories except fdic premium during were administrative expenses for the insurance agency acquired during the second quarter of  totaling million 
the million increase in earnings from to was due to several factors 
net interest income increased million to million due to the higher level of average earning assets  which offset a decrease in the net yield from to 
the provision for possible loan losses was million  down  from the level reflecting continued strength in asset quality 
revenues from noninterest sources were million  up million  led by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans and by higher net credit card processing revenues 
the increase in mortgage gains was attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   which requires the capitalization of originated servicing rights related to loans sold on a servicing retained basis 
an additional million in gains representing the value of the mortgage servicing rights were recognized in net credit card and merchant servicing income increased to million as a result of higher processing volumes in over levels 
total noninterest expense increased million to million for  of which million was due to the completion of the bwm acquisition late in the first quarter of considering the effect of including bwm for the full year  noninterest expenses were up for compared to the previous year 
financial condition loans chittenden s gross loan portfolio increased by million during  to end the year at billion 
the overall proportions of commercial related and consumer types of loans increased from the mix at the end of the company continues to pursue its strategy of gradually shifting its loan mix through continued focus on commercial and non real estate consumer lending while at the same time selling on the secondary market substantially all of its originated fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
growth in non residential consumer loans  including automobile leases  was million or from the previous year  while non real estate commercial loan growth was million or from year end the total real estate portfolio  including home equity credit lines  decreased million or from year end the classification of the company s loan portfolio is based on underlying collateral 
at december   commercial loans secured by non real estate business assets totaled million or of total loans  up from the million posted at year end commercial real estate loans  representing of the portfolio  stood at million at year end  up slightly from million at december  construction loans amounted to million at december   down slightly from million the year before 
residential real estate loans stood at million at year end  down from million at december  reflecting the shift in the company s strategy  this category represented of the portfolio at year end  compared to at year end in total  million in residential mortgages were originated during  compared to million during secondary market sales of mortgage loans totaled million in  compared to million in the company underwrites substantially all of its residential mortgages to secondary market standards 
during  the company continued to follow its policy of selling substantially all of its fixed rate residential mortgage production on a servicing retained non recourse basis 
included in the real estate portfolio are home equity credit lines  which totaled million at december   compared to million the previous year 
the unused portion of these lines totaled million at december   compared to million at year end the portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for investors totaled  million at december   compared to  million at year end these assets are owned by investors other than chittenden and therefore are not included in the consolidated balance sheets of the company 
of the loans serviced  the company originated million and the balance consisted of purchased mortgage servicing rights acquired prior to consumer loans increased significantly in  ending the year at million  compared with at year end this increase resulted from the company s continued development of the indirect auto lending and leasing market  which reflects the company s emphasis on responding to the marketplace through dealer relationships within its existing deposit franchise area 
the company underwrites all of its indirect automotive loans  maintaining substantially the same credit standards as for car loans originated in its branch offices 
the company does not originate any subprime loans 
indirect installment lending through auto dealers was up million from year end to million at the end of the company also offers auto leases through its dealer base 
this product is underwritten and priced similarly to indirect installment auto loans 
lease financing receivables outstanding at december  were million  up from million a year earlier 
the company has residual insurance through outside insurance companies which substantially eliminates the risk associated with the residual values of its leased vehicle portfolio 
contrary to these trends  direct installment and credit card balances at december  stood at million and million  respectively  compared with million and million at the end of by emphasizing the indirect and leasing programs as well as limiting credit card lending to its existing retail and commercial base these trends should continue 
unused portions of credit card lines totaled million at the end of  down from million one year earlier 
the company s lending activities are conducted in market areas focused in vermont and western and central massachusetts  with additional activity related to nearby trading areas in quebec  new york  new hampshire  maine  and connecticut 
in addition to the portfolio diversification described above  the loans are widely diversified by borrowers and industry groups 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio for the five years ended december  december  in thousands commercial      real estate residential      commercial      construction      home equity      consumer      lease financing    total gross loans      allowance for possible loan losses      net loans      mortgage loans held for sale      nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
management classifies loans  except consumer and residential loans  as nonaccrual loans when they become days past due as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and are in the process of collection 
in addition  loans that have not met this delinquency test may be placed on nonaccrual at management s discretion 
consumer and residential loans are included when management considers it to be appropriate 
nonaccrual loans with a related guarantee by a governmental agency are reflected net of those guarantees in nonperforming statistics 
generally  a loan remains on nonaccrual status until the factors which indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for possible loan losses 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is reduced and or other terms are modified because of the inability of the borrower to service debt at current market rates and terms 
other real estate owned oreo is real estate that has been formally acquired through foreclosure

oreo totaled  at year end  compared with million at the end of allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the risks in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known or anticipated at each reporting date 
in addition to evaluating the collectibility of specific loans when determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience  the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified  and economic trends 
the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against adversely classified loans  and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes 
as previously mentioned  the mix of the company s loan portfolio has changed during the past three years 
this  and uncertainties concerning how changing interest rates and unclear  or contradictory economic indicators will affect the local and regional economy also were considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses

the coverage ratio  or allowance for possible loan losses to nonperforming loans  stood at at year end  compared with at the end of the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in  compared to million in  and million in the lower provision during and was primarily attributable to the reduction in the level of nonperforming assets and the strength of the ratios in connection with the allowance for possible loan losses 
commercial charge offs for include a million charge related to ctc s commercial customer credit card processing business 
the charge off related to a future services company  which had contracted with  and accepted deposits  from customers  prior to discontinuing operations 
this company was obligated to provide services to its customers upon the payment of a second amount 
at the time this company discontinued operations  ctc chose to honor these obligations  leading to the charge off of the resulting million overdraft 
the company has assessed its merchant servicing customer base and has evaluated the processing volumes related to similar future services businesses 
it has also taken steps to mitigate the risk of similar charge offs in the future

because of the company s profitability over the past several years  total capital increased from million at december  to million at december  during  the company adopted measures to maintain a capital level consistent with the needs for its activities 
the quarterly dividend rate was increased from to per share in the second quarter and an additional special per share dividend was paid in the fourth quarter of additionally  a share repurchase plan was implemented  in which up to  shares could be repurchased during and at december   capital stood at million  a reduction of million from million at december  repurchases of  shares of the company s stock totaling million and dividend payments totaling million reduced the capital position during these reductions were partially offset by earnings of million  million of common stock issued in connection with benefit plans and a change in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of million 
the capital position increased during by million 
earnings of million and million of common stock issued in connection with benefit plans added to capital during the year 
dividend payments totaling million reduced the capital position  as did a change in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of  both the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic have defined leverage capital requirements 
at december   the company s leverage capital ratio which is calculated pursuant to the frb s regulations was  ctc s  bwm s  and fbt s leverage capital ratios which are calculated pursuant to the fdic s regulations were  and  respectively 
the ratios in were for the company  for ctc  for bwm  and for fbt 
additionally  the frb and the fdic have a risk based capital standard 
under this measure of capital  banks are required to hold more capital against certain assets perceived as more risky  such as commercial loans  than against other assets perceived as less risky  such as residential mortgage loans and us treasury securities 
further  off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit  are included for the purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
commercial banking organizations are required to have total capital equal to of risk weighted assets  and tier capital consisting of common stock and certain types of preferred stock equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
tier capital  included in total capital  includes the allowance for possible loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
at december   the company s risk based capital ratio was and its tier capital  consisting entirely of common stock  was of risk weighted assets 
this compares with year end ratios of and  respectively 
fdic regulations pertaining to capital adequacy  which apply to the banks  require a minimum leverage capital ratio for those institutions with the most favorable composite regulatory examination rating 
in addition  a tier risk based capital ratio  and an total risk based capital ratio are required for a bank to be considered adequately capitalized

liquidity and rate sensitivity the company s liquidity and rate sensitivity are monitored by the asset and liability committee  based upon policies approved by the board of directors 
strategies are implemented by the banks asset and liability committee 
this committee meets periodically to review and direct the banks lending and deposit gathering functions 
investment and borrowing activities are managed by the company s treasury function 
the measure of an institution s liquidity is its ability to meet its cash commitments at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price 
at december   the company maintained cash balances and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at december  cash on hand at december  was higher than usual due to a change in the timing of certain payments to municipalities by the state of vermont 
in addition  repurchases of the company s stock totaling million and dividend payments totaling million reduced the company s cash position during the year 
during  the company continued to be an average daily net seller of federal funds 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
these limits and guidelines reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying them and taking appropriate actions 
the company quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as simpler gap analyses 
the company uses simulation analyses to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short ie  within one year time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets and liabilities under various scenarios 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the next months should decline by less than 
the following table reflects the company s estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next months  assuming an immediate shift in interest rates rate change estimated exposure as a basis points of net interest income as noted above  one of the tools used to measure rate sensitivity is the funds gap 
the funds gap is defined as the amount by which a bank s rate sensitive assets exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
this indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period 
this mismatch will improve earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the gap is referred to as negative and indicates that a greater volume of liabilities than assets will reprice during the period 
in this case  a rising rate environment will inhibit earnings and declining rates will improve earnings 
notwithstanding this general description of the effect on income of the gap position  it may not be an accurate predictor of changes in net income 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
as of december   the estimated exposure was asset sensitive 
the following table shows the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that reprice during the periods indicated repricing date over one day over six one year over to six months to to five five months one year years years total in thousands interest earning assets loans      investment securities      interest bearing cash equivalents   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits      borrowings     total interest bearing liabilities      net interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative gap at december cumulative gap at december amounts are based on amortized cost balances

net interest income is affected by the change in interest rates and the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for  net interest income was million  up million from the level 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased million from  to million in these improvements resulted from higher levels of interest earning assets and an increase in the net yield on interest bearing liabilities

the allowance for possible loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is the amount management believes is necessary to absorb possible loan losses based on evaluations of collectibility and prior loan loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans  and current and anticipated economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
management believes that the allowance for possible loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for possible loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgements different from those of management 
the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in compared to million in see allowance for possible loan losses noninterest income and noninterest expense noninterest income was million in  up million from the million reported in trust income was up  from the level  to million 
the effects of an increase in the number of trust clients served and higher levels of administered assets were enhanced by the impact of the advances in the stock and bond markets during the year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased in  rising to million from million in the previous year 
this was partially attributable to ctc s new deposit fee schedule  which was implemented during the second quarter of net income related to credit card activities includes fees and costs related to the issuance of credit cards and revenue generated net of processing costs when credit card transactions are processed through the company s commercial customers 
the company has emphasized development of this business in recent years which has expanded to include local and national customers involved in retail  service  and mail order businesses 
these activities generated net income of million in  up from million in the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the number of commercial customers serviced  and consequently  significantly higher levels of credit card processing volume  billion was processed in  compared with million in net insurance commissions generated by the insurance agency acquired in may totaled million 
in addition  the company posted a total of million in other noninterest income compared to million in this category represents over thirty categories of fee income 
noninterest expense totaled million in  up million from the level 
salaries increased million from million in employee benefits increased by million to million in the increases in salaries and benefits during were primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million resulting from higher staffing levels and related recruitment expenses and a  increase in accruals for incentive compensation plans due to stronger profits 
fdic insurance premiums totaled  up from  in the banks paid minimal insurance assessments in as compared to  when assessment rates were increased to cents per of deposits

the majority of the company s income is generated in the state of vermont  which levies franchise taxes on banking institutions based upon average deposit levels in lieu of taxing income 
on august   the franchise tax rate increased from to 
per  of deposits 
this increased franchise tax expense from approximately  per month prior to august  to approximately  per month thereafter 
for the year ended december   total franchise taxes of  were approximately  higher than in franchise taxes are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
for  the federal and state income tax provisions amounted to million 
this compares with an income tax provision of million for the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
during and  the company s statutory federal corporate tax rate was 
the company s effective tax rates differed from the statutory rates primarily because of the proportion of interest income from state and municipal securities and corporate dividend income which are partially exempt from federal taxation and tax credits on investments in qualified low income housing projects 
year the year problem  which is common to most corporations  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to properly recognize and process date sensitive information as the year approaches 
the company has commenced an assessment of the majority of its systems and is in the process of developing a specific workplan to address this issue 
the company currently believes it will be able to modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effect on operations 
while it is not possible  at present  to give an accurate estimate of the cost of this work  these costs may be material to the company s results of operations in one or more fiscal quarters or years  but are not expected to have material adverse impact on the long term results of operations  liquidity  or consolidated financial position of the company 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net interest income for  net interest income was million  up million from the level 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased million from  to million in these improvements resulted from higher levels of interest earning assets that outpaced a decrease in the net yield on earning assets 
average interest earning assets totaled  million for  up million from the level 
the taxable equivalent net yield on earning assets was in  down nine basis points from in because the reduction in the average yield on earning assets was greater than the reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the net yield on earning assets declined from the year before  although growth in net earning assets produced a higher net interest income on a tax equivalent basis than a year ago 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in and million in the provision was reduced due to  among other things  the reduction in the level of net losses experienced in the loan portfolio and the strength of the ratios in connection with the allowance for possible loan losses 
noninterest income and noninterest expense noninterest income was million in  up million from the million reported in trust income was up  from the level  to million 
the effects of an increase in the number of trust clients served and higher levels of administered assets were enhanced by the impact of the advances in the stock and bond markets during the year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased again in  rising to million from million in the previous year 
mortgage banking activity was strong throughout  as generally favorable interest rates impacted the business 
mortgage servicing income rose slightly to million 
the january  adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  which requires the capitalization of mortgage servicing rights which relate to loans which have been originated and sold on a servicing retained basis  led to a million increase in gain on sale of mortgages 
net income related to credit card activities includes fees and costs related to the issuance of credit cards and revenue generated net of processing costs when credit card transactions are processed through the company s commercial customers 
these activities generated net income of million in  up from million in the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the number of customers serviced  and consequently  significantly higher levels of credit card processing volume  million was processed in  compared with million in the company posted a total of million in other noninterest income  up  from the level 
this category represents over thirty categories of fee income
