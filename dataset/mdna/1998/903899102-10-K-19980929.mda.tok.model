item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis below  and throughout this report  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements 
the following discussions and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
general the company develops  manufactures and markets primary and rechargeable lithium batteries for use in a wide array of applications 
recently  the company has been focusing on the commercialization of its advanced rechargeable batteries which are based on its proprietary lithium ion solid polymer technology and are integrated into consumer electronic applications such as portable computers and cellular telephones 
the company believes that its advanced rechargeable batteries are the only solid polymer lithium batteries that have been manufactured and sold for commercial use 
the company intends to increase its production capacity of advanced rechargeable batteries in order to supply oems and the after market for consumer replacement of batteries in electronic devices 
the company was formed in december in march  the company acquired certain technology and assets from kodak relating to the volt lithium manganese dioxide battery 
the company then expanded its operation by its acquisition by its subsidiary  ultralife batteries uk ltd  in june of certain assets of dowty in abingdon  england 
the customer base of ultralife uk was further expanded by the acquisition of assets of hoppecke in july since revenues and expenses of ultralife uk are paid in british pounds sterling  the company s results of operations are not materially affected by changes in currency fluctuations 
in december  a fire occurred at the company s abingdon  england facility  which caused extensive damage to the manufacturing facilities 
since the december fire  the company has been receiving insurance proceeds compensating the company for loss of its plant and machinery  leasehold improvements  inventory and business interruption 
sales of high rate and sea water batteries have been significantly reduced over the past months  however  the company s insurance policy covers losses associated with business interruption until may if insurance proceeds relate to reimbursement for destroyed assets  the proceeds are reflected as gain on fire on the statement of operations 
if the insurance proceeds relate to reimbursement of excess costs of working such as rental of temporary space  telephones  vehicles transportation to move to the temporary site  et cetera  such proceeds are recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
if the insurance proceeds relate to reimbursement for normal overhead costs related to lower production volumes resulting from the fires  such proceeds are recorded as an offset to cost of sales 
insurance proceeds received by the company may exceed recorded losses 
the company has incurred net operating losses primarily as a result of funding research and development activities  and to a lesser extent manufacturing and general and administrative costs 
to date  the company has devoted a substantial portion of its resources to the research and development of its products and technology  particularly its proprietary lithium ion solid polymer technology 
the company expects its operating expenses to increase as it expands production activities 
the company s results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the number of orders received  technology contracts entered into and the pace of the company s research and development activities 
year ended june  in thousands total revenues by business segment battery sales    technology contracts    total revenues    net income loss by business segment batteries    technology contracts all other    net loss    results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  revenues total revenues of the company increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  battery sales decreased  or approximately from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decline in battery sales was primarily due to lower sales of high rate batteries by ultralife uk as a result of suspended operations at the company s abingdon  england facility due to a fire which occurred in december the completion of the u 
s 
army contract in december for ba primary batteries also contributed to the lower sales in fiscal substantially offsetting these declines were greater sales of volt lithium batteries which increased over the prior year 
technology contract revenues increased  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the increase in technology contract revenues resulted principally from development funds arising from the company s agreement with mitsubishi for the development of rechargeable batteries for a new generation notebook computer 
in addition  work on the company s phase iii small business innovation research sbir department of defense contract for enhanced ba batteries further contributed to higher technology contract revenues 
cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue decreased from approximately to for the year ended june  cost of batteries sold decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the cost of batteries sold as a percentage of revenues was principally the result of increased production volumes of volt batteries 
during the fourth quarter the company attempted to further increase its production rates for volt batteries to respond to an increase in customer orders 
while the company was successful in achieving a moderate increase over the previous quarter  the company experienced higher production costs along with lower yields 
corrective actions are being implemented to improve efficiencies at higher production rates  which the company believes will improve yields  raise production levels and lower costs as a percentage of sales over the next several quarters 
cost of products sold includes  of insurance proceeds received by ultralife uk that offset unabsorbed overhead expenses resulting from lower production volumes associated with suspended manufacturing operations following the december fire 
technology contracts cost of sales increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from to for the year ended june  the decrease in technology contract cost of sales as a percentage of revenue reflects a greater number of contracts to absorb overhead expenses 
operating and other expenses operating and other expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  of the company s operating and other expenses  research and development expenses increased  or  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  research and development expenses increased as a result of the company s efforts to improve its production processes and performance of its advanced rechargeable batteries 
selling  general and administration expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the increase in selling  general and administration expenses are primarily attributable to increased personnel to support the company s expansion plans  legal costs to resolve various claims  higher compensation  and associated personnel expenses 
selling and administrative expenses also include insurance proceeds of a  offsetting incremental costs of operations corresponding to replacement facility rental  transportation costs and other such costs relating to the december fire at ultralife uk 
total operating and other expenses also decreased by  as a result of the receipt of insurance proceeds to replace assets previously written off due to fires at ultralife uk 
interest income interest income decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease of interest income is the result of lower average balances invested since the company used cash and investments to fund operations and capital additions primarily for high volume production equipment for rechargeable batteries 
net losses net losses decreased  from  or per share  for the year ended june  to  or per share  for the year ended june   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
year ended june  compared with the year ended june  revenues total revenues increased by  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this was principally due to an increase of battery sales in the amount of  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this increase in battery revenues was generated by both the us and the us operations 
in the us  revenues from the company s ba battery increased  as contract extensions were received from the us army which supported increasing production rates throughout the year 
this was partially offset by reduced levels of volt battery sales which declined  primarily in the smoke detector market 
in the uk  sales to the ministry of defense increased  reflecting increased orders for high energy batteries 
this increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from high rate lithium and seawater batteries in the second half of the year due to a fire in december at the abingdon  england facility 
revenues generated from technology contracts decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease in revenues from technology contracts is primarily attributable to the completion of certain contracts and delays in receipt of new development programs as the company focused its efforts on the implementation of the company s production line of advanced rechargeable batteries 
cost of products sold cost of products sold increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues remained at approximately during the fiscal year ended june  and june  cost of batteries sold increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  cost of batteries sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from approximately for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  the decrease in cost of batteries sold as a percentage of revenues reflects the receipt of  from insurance proceeds as a result of fires in september and december at the company s abingdon  england facility 
partially offsetting this recovery of costs associated with fires were increased costs of batteries attributable to the company s decision to temporarily reduce manufacturing levels of volt batteries to align inventory with sales volume 
technology cost of sales decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  reflecting lower contract volumes 
cost of technology contracts as a percentage of revenues increased from approximately for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  this increase reflects greater direct costs of fulfilling contracts performed during the year ended june  than for the prior year 
operating and other expenses operating and other expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  attributable to increased support provided for new products planned to be introduced 
the year ended june  included the receipt of insurance proceeds amounting to  to offset costs relating to the september and december fires 
research and development expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this increase is due primarily to increased expenditures related to the development of the rechargeable battery program 
also included in total operating and other expenses was  received in excess of the loss provision related to the fires which occurred in the abingdon  england factory 
during the three months ended march   a reserve of  was established for the december fire and during the year ended june  the company provided a reserve of  for losses related to the september fire 
generally  the company records expenses related to the fires as they are incurred and records the offsetting insurance proceeds only when received 
operating and other expenses also increased as a result of a write off of a china development project and related receivables due under provisions of various agreements during the year ended june  the total cost of these write offs was  the original purpose of the company s participation in a china development program was to make available a a size lithium battery at a competitive cost 
other sources for this battery have since been identified 
interest income interest income decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  the year ended june   due to a lower average balance invested as the company used cash and investments to fund capital equipment improvements and operations during the year ended june  net loss net loss increased  or per share  from a net loss of  or per share  in the year ended june  to  or per share  in the year ended june   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
during the year ended june   the company realized a gain of  or per share  as the result of a sale of  shares of common stock of intermagnetics general corporation igc 
if the company would not have realized a gain from the sale of shares of igc  net loss would have increased  or per share  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   cash equivalents and available for sale securities totalled  on may  the company completed a secondary public offering for  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds were  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
during the year ended june   the company used  of cash in operating activities as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase in cash used in operations is the net result of the net loss for the year  reduced provisions for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence  and increased trade receivables and prepaid and other current assets offset by lower inventories  higher accounts payables and increased depreciation and authorization expenses 
the increase in trade receivables primarily reflects higher fourth quarter sales as days sales in trade receivables were days at june  as compared to days at june  the decrease in inventories at june  is the result of continued improvement in the turnover of battery inventories 
months cost of sales in inventory at june  was months as compared to months at june  in the year ended june   the company used  to purchase plant  property and equipment 
of this amount  related to the acquisition of assets for the reinstatement of ultralife uk s manufacturing facility following the fire in december   relates to the acquisition of the company s newark  new york facilities and the balance is substantially machinery and equipment for the company s rechargeable battery production line 
the company has long term debt of  relating to the capital lease obligation for the company s newark  new york offices and manufacturing facilities 
a line of credit in the amount of  is maintained by ultralife uk for short term working capital requirements 
however  with sales growth and expansion  the company will explore normal working capital lines of credit 
the company believes that its present cash position and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the company s estimated cash requirements for at least months

year compliance many existing computer programs utilized globally use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs  if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year this year issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
the company has undertaken a program to address its exposure to year issues 
the company plans to install new year compliant manufacturing and accounting software and believes that its implementation plan will be successful 
although there can be no assurance with respect thereto  the company does not expect that the year issues including the cost of the company s compliance program as currently estimated will have material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
