it is also possible that these developments could mean that the industry is entering a downturn in its cycle 
the company is uncertain at this time as to the extent and duration of these developments and as to what effect these factors will have on the company s future sales and earnings

at the end of  and  cac held  and million of installment contracts receivable  respectively  and had established allowances for credit losses of  and million  respectively 
since its inception  cac has been restricted in the amounts of loans it could purchase based on restricted underwriting standards  the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
in february  cac entered into an agreement the retail finance agreement  with another lender providing for the periodic resale of a portion of cac s loans that meet established criteria 
on march   cac sold loans to this lender having an outstanding principal amount of approximately million for cash in the approximate amount of million  of which million was used to retire debt 
the effect of this transaction on net income would be to reduce the amount of financial services revenue for interest income on this portion of the portfolio  offset by reduced interest expense on retired debt and earnings on the remaining proceeds 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts receivable under the retail finance agreement will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cac to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under this agreement  or that cac and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreement

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities for the three years ended december    and was to  to and to  respectively 
the company entered into a credit agreement the credit facility with its primary lender in february and later amended it in march of the facility presently consists of a million revolving  warehouse and term loan agreement 
the credit facility contains a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit of up to and of the company s eligible as defined accounts receivable and inventories  respectively  up to a maximum of million 
interest is payable under the revolving line of credit at the bank s prime rate 
the warehouse and term loan agreements contained in the credit facility provide for borrowings of up to of the company s eligible as defined installment sales contracts  up to a maximum of million 
interest on the term notes is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at a rate based on the weekly average yield on five year treasury securities averaged over the preceding weeks  plus  with a floating rate for the remaining two years subject to certain limits equal to the bank s prime rate plus

the renewal provides for a revolving line of credit with a maximum of million an increase from million and a warehouse line of million an increase from million and includes a fixed rate term loan feature 
the company currently does not expect a material change to the restrictive and financial covenants included in the credit facility 
the company s growth strategy currently includes the continued expansion of financial services  component supply operations  and its independent dealer network and the pursuit of additional acquisitions 
the company may also utilize funds in the acquisition or establishment of retail sales centers 
accordingly  it is likely that the company will incur additional debt  or other forms of financing  in order to continue to fund the pursuit of such growth strategies 
the company currently believes existing cash and investment balances which include proceeds from the sale of a portion of its installment loan portfolio described above and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
in order to provide additional funds for continued pursuit of the company s growth strategies and for operations  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
the company may continue to engage in other transactions  such as selling or securitizing all or portions of its installment loan portfolio  that are designed to facilitate the ability of the company to originate an increased volume of loans and to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company has recently entered into such a transaction pursuant to the retail finance agreement described above under results of operations financial services 
there can be no assurance that such possible additional financing  or the aforementioned potential transactions involving the company s installment loan portfolio  will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
it is possible that a future lack of financing or a prolonged downturn in industry conditions could cause the company to curtail the expansion of financial services or otherwise alter its growth strategies 
impact of inflation the company generally has been able to increase its selling prices to offset increased costs  including the costs of raw materials 
sudden increases in costs as well as price competition can affect the ability of the company to increase its selling prices 
the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability  but can give no assurance that this trend will continue in the future

year compliance the inability of computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year is commonly referred to as the year compliance issue 
as the year approaches  such systems may be unable to accurately process certain date based information

the company plans on completing the testing process of all significant applications by december  in addition  the company has initiated communcations with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year compliance readiness and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
the total cost to the company of these year compliance activities is not expected to exceed million in any given year 
these costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans
