such amounts represented increases over the respective prior years of  and 
after tax earnings before special charges were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
such amounts represented increases over the respective prior years of  and

the fiscal amount represented a decrease of from the prior year while the fiscal and amounts represented increases over the prior years of and  respectively 
ii the following table summarizes the components of the company s operating income for the past three years and should be read in connection with the discussion below 
years ended september  change dollars in millions revenues excluding bulk shipments    bulk shipments    total net sales and other revenues    cost of sales    gross profit distribution  selling  general administrative expenses dsg a operating earnings before special charges special charges operating earnings percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments gross profit dsg a expenses operating earnings before special charges operating earnings revenues along with other companies in its industry  the company has begun reporting bulk shipments of pharmaceuticals in revenues and cost of sales 
previously  only the gross profit on such bulk shipments was reported in revenues 
all years presented herein have been reclassified to conform with the new reporting method 
bulk shipment transactions are arranged by the company with its suppliers at the express direction of the customer  and involve either a shipments from the supplier directly to the customer s warehouse or b shipments from the supplier to company warehouses for immediate shipment to the customer s warehouse 
bulk sales of pharmaceuticals do not impact the company s inventory since the company simply processes the orders that it receives from its suppliers directly to the customers warehouses 
the company serves as an intermediary by paying the supplier and billing the customer for the goods 
due to the insignificant margins generated through bulk shipments  fluctuations in such revenues have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
ii revenues excluding bulk shipments increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
substantially all of such increases reflect internal growth within the company s existing pharmaceutical  medical surgical supply and specialty products distribution businesses  with only a minor portion attributable to acquired entities 
all three of the aforementioned businesses contributed to the revenue growth in these years 
revenues from the pharmaceutical business grew in and in  with increases across all major customer categories and geographic regions 
such increases were volume related  reflecting growth from higher shipments to existing customers as well as from shipments to a significant number of new customers 
revenues from the medical surgical business increased less than in following a growth rate in  the slower growth was principally due to a the inability of the business current sales and operating infrastructure to bring on and process increased volume and b the discontinuance of certain product lines 
the company is positioning the medical surgical business for higher future growth rates by increasing capacity in its distribution centers  integrating its operations for greater efficiency  and developing a new information technology platform 
revenues from the specialty products business increased and in and  respectively  primarily reflecting growth from existing and new customers 
gross margins gross profit as a percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
these decreases primarily reflect lower margins in the pharmaceutical and medical surgical businesses  as well as a relatively lower sales mix from the higher margin medical surgical business 
pharmaceutical margins decreased principally due to lower selling margins resulting from intense price competition in the industry  partially offset by increased investment buying gains in fiscal medical surgical margins declined primarily due to a higher sales mix of lower margin shipments to the acute care market 
specialty product margins improved due to investment buying opportunities and the addition of higher margin products and services 
in all of the company s businesses  it is customary to pass on manufacturers price increases to customers 
investment buying enables distributors such as the company to benefit by purchasing goods in advance of anticipated manufacturer price increases 
consequently  the rate or frequency of future price increases by manufacturers  or the lack thereof  influences the profitability of the company 
management anticipates further downward pressure on gross margins in fiscal because of continued price competition influenced by large customers 
management expects that these pressures may be offset to some extent by an increased sales mix of more profitable products such as generic drugs and medical surgical supplies and services and continued reduction of distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  as described below 
ii distribution  selling  general administrative expenses dsg a dsg a as a percentage of revenues excluding bulk shipments was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
these decreases were primarily attributable to continued operating efficiencies and the spreading of fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
through such measures as consolidation of distribution centers  installation of automated warehouse equipment  and investments in information technology  the company s infrastructure has been able to process increasing volume without a proportionate increase in dsg a 
also contributing to the decrease in dsg a percentage in fiscal was the lower sales mix of the medical surgical business  which incurs relatively higher dsg a per revenue dollar 
special charges following is a summary of the special charges incurred by the company in the last two fiscal years years ended september  in millions except per share amounts goodwill writedown restructuring expenses abandoned capitalized software merger related expenses total special charges tax effect of special charges effect on net earnings effect on diluted earnings per share during fiscal  the company recorded a special non cash pre tax charge of million for the writedown of bergen brunswig medical corporation bbmc goodwill related to certain acquisitions made prior to september  resulting from a realized impairment to the carrying value of bbmc s long lived assets 
in addition to the goodwill writedown  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million for bbmc restructuring expenses which represent severance costs associated with streamlining and refocusing the sales organization and costs associated with the consolidation of four divisions to improve efficiency and customer service 
other special charges recorded during fiscal include a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the ii abandonment of capitalized software as a result of technology improvements  and a pre tax charge of million related primarily to the proposed merger with cardinal health  inc cardinal which was terminated on august  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million for expenses related to the proposed merger with ivax corporation which was terminated on march  other income statement line items net interest expense increased million  or  in fiscal and million  or  in fiscal the fiscal increase resulted from increased borrowings under the credit agreement  principally for funding higher investments in inventory in order to a support the significant growth in the company s revenues and b to take advantage of increased investment buying opportunities 
taxes on income were approximately  and of pre tax earnings in fiscal  and  respectively 
the relatively high fiscal rate reflects the nondeductible writedown of goodwill described under special charges above 
excluding this writedown  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
earnings per share fluctuations primarily result from changes in the company s net earnings 
due primarily to the exercise of stock options  there was a increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculations in each of fiscal and ii liquidity and capital resources following is a summary of the company s capitalization at the end of each of the last three fiscal years 
except that debt is net of cash herein  these percentages are calculated in accordance with the covenants set forth in the company s credit agreement  in which certain non cash charges are excluded from the calculation september  debt  net of cash equity the company s credit agreement with a group of domestic and foreign banks is effective through march and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million plus additional borrowings under discretionary lines outside of the credit agreement 
outstanding borrowings at september  and were and million  respectively 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec which became effective on march  the registration statement allows the company to sell senior and subordinated debt or equity securities to the public from time to time up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
the company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of any such securities for general corporate purposes  which may include  without limitation  the repayment of indebtedness of the company or any of its subsidiaries  possible acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
to date  the company has not sold any securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
on september   the company declared a for stock split on the company s class a common stock common stock  which was paid on december  to shareholders of record on november  all per share amounts presented herein have been restated to reflect the effect of this stock split 
dividends per share declared on common stock amounted to  
and 
per share in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  the fiscal amount includes the 
per share quarterly dividend which was declared on september  but not paid until december  to shareholders of record on november  this 
constituted the company s fiscal first quarter dividend  the declaration was made earlier than usual in order to coincide with the announcement of the aforementioned for stock split 
although the company does not have a policy requiring the payment of any ii specified levels of dividends  the company s dividends excluding the aforementioned 
have averaged approximately of net earnings before special charges for the three year period ended september  the company s cash flows during the past three years are summarized in the following table in millions net earnings after non cash charges increases in non cash assets and liabilities cash flows from operations capital expenditures acquisition of businesses net proceeds repayments of debt cash dividends other net net increase decrease in cash during the past three years  cash flow from operations has been adequate to fund working capital increases  capital expenditures  business acquisitions and dividend payments 
the company believes that internally generated cash flow  funds available under the credit agreement  and funds potentially available in the private and public capital markets will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash and capital requirements 
however  actual results could differ materially from this forward looking statement as a result of unanticipated capital requirements or an inability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms when  and  if necessary 
working capital increased to million at september  from million at september   primarily as a result of higher receivables and inventory balances supporting an growth in revenues 
the current ratio decreased slightly to at september  from at september  trade receivables outstanding  net of customer credit balances  were days during fiscal and days during fiscal the inventory turnover rate on a first in  first out fifo basis was times during fiscal and times during fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal and related principally to additional investments in existing locations as well as purchases of automated warehousing and data processing equipment

year readiness disclosure the year problem results from computer programs and devices which do not differentiate between the year and the year because they were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer systems that have date sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year this situation may cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly or not at all  which would result in significant disruptions of the company s business activities 
since the company relies heavily on computer technology throughout its businesses to effectively carry out its day to day operations  it has made resolution of the year problem a major corporate initiative 
in october  the company established a central office to direct its companywide year efforts for all of its business  including bbdc  bbmc and bbsc 
a steering committee comprised of several executive officers provides top level oversight for the program 
both internal and external resources are being used to identify  correct and test the company s systems for year compliance 
ii the company s year program addresses both information technology it and non it systems 
the company s business applications reside on mainframe  midrange and desktop computer systems 
the company s it infrastructure is comprised of hardware  internally developed software  and software purchased from external vendors 
the company s non it systems include equipment which uses date sensitive embedded technology 
principal non it systems include telecommunications equipment  certain facilities functions  automated warehouse equipment  and hand held order entry devices which the company has provided to its customers 
the company has divided its year program by business unit and functional area into numerous individual projects in order to provide detailed management for each at risk system 
the company s approach is to address each year project in the following phases inventory  assessment  planning  renovation  testing and certification 
for bbdc  renovation of all critical systems and the majority of other systems will be completed by december  certain systems have already been tested and certified as year compliant  and the company expects testing and certification of substantially all remaining systems to be completed by june  by that date  the company also plans to complete a comprehensive enterprise integration testing program 
during the latter half of calendar  the company expects there to be a relatively limited amount of effort required to complete the renovation and testing of certain non it systems 
bbmc and bbsc are comprised of a number of entities acquired during the last several years 
although some of the computer systems within these entities are year complaint  certain significant computer systems are not year compliant 
certain of the non compliant systems will be remediated for year compliance while the remainder will be replaced with year compliant systems 
it is expected that all of bbmc s and bbsc s systems will be year compliant by october  including testing and certification 
the company also recognizes that it would be at risk if its suppliers  customers  banks  utilities  transportation companies and other business partners fail to properly remediate their year systems and software 
accordingly  during calendar the company began the process of communicating with such entities through questionnaires and other means in order to assess the status of their remediation efforts 
during early calendar  the company will meet with major business partners to discuss progress and contingencies  conduct on site assessments  and test critical electronic interfaces 
although the company is not aware of any significant year problems with any of these third parties  there can be no assurances that their systems or software will be remediated in a timely manner  or that a remediation failure would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is also subject to risk should government or private payors and insurers fail to become year compliant and therefore be unable to make full or timely reimbursement to the company s customers 
such a situation could ii have a material adverse affect on the company s cash flows by reducing the ability of customers to pay for products purchased from the company 
the company is charging the cost of its year program to expense as incurred  except for purchases of computer hardware and other equipment  which are capitalized as property and depreciated over the equipment s estimated useful lives in accordance with the company s normal accounting policies 
through september   total year costs have amounted to approximately million  of which million was incurred in fiscal and million was incurred in fiscal remaining expenditures are expected to be approximately million including million of hardware and other equipment  of which million is planned for fiscal and million is planned for fiscal the aforementioned amounts exclude the costs associated with new bbmc and bbsc systems which are being installed primarily to integrate operations and achieve additional information technology functionality 
the year remediation effort has not had a material impact on the company s daily operations or the development of its information technology systems 
although the aforementioned cost estimates reflect management s best judgment using current information and assumptions about the future  actual costs could vary significantly from the company s estimates  due to technological difficulties  the noncompliance of it vendors or other third parties  the year readiness of companies acquired by the company subsequent to september  and by entities that communicate with such companies  and other factors 
while the company is not presently aware of any significant exposure that its systems and software will not be properly remediated on a timely basis  there can be no assurances that all year remediation processes will be completed and tested before january  or that the contingency plans described below will sufficiently mitigate the risk of a year compliance problem 
if year remediation efforts by the company or third parties are unsuccessful  there could be a significant disruption of the company s business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is in the process of identifying the major potential failure points and the related adverse consequences associated with them  including a reasonably worst case scenario 
once these risks are identified  the company will develop contingency plans for conducting its business until the problems can be corrected 
for example  such plans will include alternative electronic or manual means of receiving  processing and shipping customer orders  purchasing inventory from suppliers  and sending and receiving cash payments 
it is anticipated that contingency plans will be substantially completed by may  although there will be continuing follow up activity later in calendar as january  approaches 
the foregoing discussion concerning the year problem contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties referred to above and in exhibit a to this annual report that could cause actual ii results to differ materially from such statements 
although the company believes that minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues  there is no assurance that all year problems will be remediated in a timely manner by the company or third parties and that any such failures will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal and fiscal  the company plans to adopt several new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board and the american institute of certified public accountants 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant impact on the company s reported financial position or results of operations 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is the effect of changing interest rates 
the company manages its interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at september   the company s debt consisted of approximately million of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of and million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company s cash requirements  maximum borrowings at any quarter end during fiscal were million 
if interest rates on such variable debt were to increase by basis points one tenth of the rate at september   the net impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows would be immaterial
