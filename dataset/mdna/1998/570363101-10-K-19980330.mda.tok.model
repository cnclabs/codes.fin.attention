item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of maritrans inc the corporation  and  together with its subsidiaries and its predecessor  maritrans partners lp the partnership  herein called maritrans or the company 
overview historically  maritrans has served the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using tugs  barges and marine terminal facilities to provide marine transportation and terminalling services along the east and gulf coasts of the united states 
between and  maritrans has transported at least million barrels annually 
the high was million barrels in  and the low was million barrels in many factors affect the number of barrels transported and will affect future results for maritrans  including its vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption particularly in florida and the northeastern us  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies operating and sourcing decisions  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
since  maritrans has taken steps to modify the mix of operating characteristics of its fleet 
maritrans has increased its vessel capacity with the placing in service of its two largest oceangoing  double hulled petroleum tank barges  the ocean and maritrans  with capacities of approximately  and  barrels  respectively 
in  maritrans made additional modifications to its fleet by acquiring three oil tankers varying between  and  barrels of capacity 
maritrans will be acquiring an additional  barrel oil tanker in additionally  maritrans has announced a pilot project to rebuild one of its existing  single hulled   barrel class barges with a double hull design configuration to comply with the provisions of the oil pollution act of opa 
should the one barge pilot project prove successful  the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to eight more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hulled barges 
over this period  maritrans has also made reductions in owned capacity  disposing of vessels which  due to their sizes and operating characteristics  maritrans considered excess to its long term business needs 
legislation the enactment of opa significantly increased the liability exposure of marine transporters of petroleum in the event of an oil spill 
in addition  several states in which maritrans operates have enacted legislation increasing the liability for oil spills in their waters 
maritrans currently maintains oil pollution liability insurance of million on each of its vessels 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential liabilities in the event of a catastrophic spill  that additional premium costs will be recoverable through increased vessel charter rates  or that such insurance will continue to be available in satisfactory amounts 
moreover  this legislation has increased other operating costs as maritrans has taken steps to minimize the risk of spills 
among such costs are those for additional training  safety and contingency programs  these expenses have not yet been and may never be fully recovered through increased vessel charter rates 
additionally  management believes that the legislation has effectively reduced the total volume of waterborne petroleum transportation as shippers of petroleum have tried to limit their exposure to opa liability 
this legislation has had a material adverse effect on maritrans operations  financial performance and expectations 
opa is expected to continue having negative effects on the entire us oil and marine petroleum transportation industry  including maritrans 
these effects could include i increased capital expenditures to cover the cost of mandated double hulled vessels expenditures that the independent marine transporters of petroleum may not be able to finance  ii continued increased maintenance  training  insurance and other operating costs  iii increased liability and exposure to civil penalties  iv decreased operating revenues as a result of further reductions in volumes transported on vessels and v increased difficulty in obtaining sufficient insurance  particularly oil pollution coverage 
these effects could adversely affect maritrans profitability and liquidity 
opa will require the retirement of  or retrofitting with double hulls  all single hulled petroleum tankers and barges operating in us waters  including most of maritrans existing barges 
the first of maritrans affected barges will have to be retired or retrofitted by however  most of maritrans large oceangoing  single hulled barges will be affected january  maritrans barges under  gross registered tons are not scheduled for retirement until the two single hulled tankers purchased in are affected in and  respectively  at which time they will be required to comply with opa or be operated outside us waters 
approximately percent of maritrans operating capacity has been qualified by the united states coast guard as meeting the double hull requirements and  therefore  is allowed to continue operating without modification and without a legislatively determined retirement date 
if maritrans were to replace its entire single hulled oil carrying vessel capacity with newly built double hulls  the estimated cost would be approximately million  based on an estimated replacement cost of per barrel of capacity 
this estimate could be higher as shipyard costs increase 
during  maritrans announced plans for a pilot double hull rebuild project to convert one of its existing  single hulled  barrel class barges to a double hull design configuration 
recently maritrans awarded a shipyard contract to carry out the double hull rebuilding and coating of the tanks for the barge to be used in the pilot project  the ocean  for a total cost of approximately million 
the results of this initial rebuild project  including subsequent performance of the vessel  will be evaluated in order to determine whether maritrans enters into a multi vessel rebuilding program for other single hulled vessels of similar size 
maritrans believes that eight of its additional barges may be suitable candidates for the double hull design and related construction methodology of the pilot project 
if maritrans were to double hull these nine vessels  it would represent approximately percent of maritrans operating capacity 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for totalled million compared with million in  an increase of million or percent 
barrels of cargo transported increased by million  from million to million or percent 
volumes in the comparable prior period were negatively impacted by the shutdowns of refinery capacity in the delaware valley area during the first part of the increase in volumes in is attributable to improvements in maritrans shorter haul route business as those refineries were placed back in service 
several of the vessels that were reassigned to other geographic areas last year have been moved back into delaware valley based trades 
utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  totaled percent for compared to percent in during  contracts were renewed with some of maritrans larger customers 
while a number of these contracts will result in lower revenue per barrel transported  maritrans has gained either higher vessel utilization or higher volume commitments with those customers  and decreased its exposure to the spot market 
the markets within which maritrans operates continue to experience severe price competition for oil transportation services  which is expected to continue 
management believes  however  that the level of contractually committed utilization will partially insulate maritrans from these pressures 
revenues from sources other than marine transportation decreased from percent of total revenues in to percent in operating expenses of million increased by million or percent from million in the increase was due to the addition of two tug barge units and three tankers in the fourth quarter  which increased vessel operating costs 
prior to the fourth quarter  operating costs had decreased primarily from earlier reductions in owned vessel capacity that maritrans considered excess to its long term needs due to the equipment s size and operating characteristics  and reduced general and administrative expenses 
interest expense decreased by million from million in to million in due to lower levels of principal outstanding 
other income in increased by million from million in to million in due primarily to greater interest earned on short term investments 
net income for increased by million to million as a result of the aforementioned increased revenues and other income more than offsetting the increase in operating costs 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for were million and were million in  an increase of million  or two percent 
barrels of cargo transported decreased by million barrels  from million to million  or three percent 
curtailment of a portion of refinery throughput in the delaware valley refineries in caused maritrans to employ its vessel capacity in alternative markets 
this had the result of increasing average trip length  which further resulted in higher average revenues per barrel transported  as equipment formerly utilized in and around delaware valley refining and terminalling locations was redeployed into the gulf of mexico  the chesapeake bay  and into delivery locations in the caribbean 
the markets within which maritrans operates continue to experience severe price competition for oil transportation services which is expected to continue 
revenue from sources other than marine transportation decreased from percent of total revenues in to percent in operating expenses of million for increased by million  or percent from million in the maritrans unit  maritrans second largest tug barge unit  entered service in the fourth quarter of and was operational for the full year in the aforementioned increase in trip length and rising fuel prices contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
general and administrative costs rose as a result of the increased use of outside professional services  particularly for matters related to business development and analysis 
interest expense in was consistent with the prior year 
other income in increased million from million in to million in due primarily to the gain from disposals of vessels which  due to their sizes and operating characteristics  were considered excess to maritrans long term business needs 
net income for increased by million to million as the result of the aforementioned increased revenues and other income more than offsetting the increase in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources in  existing cash and cash equivalents  augmented by operating activities and financing transactions  were sufficient to fully meet debt service obligations including million in required long term debt repayments  to meet loan agreement restrictions  to make capital acquisitions and improvements  and to allow maritrans to pay a dividend of per common share in each of the first three quarters and per common share in the last quarter 
maritrans believes that in  funds provided by operating activities  augmented by financing transactions and investing activities  will be sufficient to finance operations  anticipated capital expenditures  lease payments and required debt repayments 
dividend payments are expected to continue quarterly in in october  maritrans completed the acquisition of six vessels from subsidiaries of sun company  inc  sun for million 
in the transaction maritrans purchased two petroleum tankers and two tug and barge units 
maritrans funded this acquisition with existing cash and cash equivalents 
on october   maritrans entered into a revolving credit facility for million with mellon bank  na  which is collateralized by mortgages on acquired tankers 
on october   maritrans and chevron usa inc chevron executed agreements for maritrans purchase of two chevron petroleum tankers under certain conditions 
the total cost to maritrans is approximately million 
the chevron vessels are  deadweight ton  double hulled oil tankers that comply with all international maritime organization imo and opa design criteria for future trading 
the company purchased the first vessel on november   for million and expects to purchase the second vessel during  if certain conditions are met 
on november   maritrans borrowed million from its revolving credit facility with mellon bank  na to complete the purchase of the first vessel 
maritrans expects to fund the second chevron vessel acquisition with a combination of its cash and the revolving credit facility referred to above 
in addition to the vessel acquisitions previously mentioned  capital expenditures in for improvements to its existing fleet of vessels and marine terminals were approximately million compared to million in additionally  the company advanced nearly million of an expected total cost of approximately million to a shipyard to begin work on prefabrication of a steel structure to be used in the company s pilot project to rebuild and to coat the tanks of its single hulled barge  the ocean  as a double hulled barge 
total capital expenditure commitments at december   for the second chevron vessel mentioned above and the ocean double hulling project totaled approximately million 
on may   the company announced a year s extension to its previously announced stock buy back plan to reacquire up to million shares of its common stock  depending on market conditions 
this amount represented approximately percent of the million shares outstanding at the beginning of the program 
maritrans intends to hold the majority of the shares as treasury stock  although some shares may be used for employee compensation plans and or other corporate purposes 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
no open market purchases were made in maritrans has financed and expects that additional share purchases  if made  would be financed with internally generated funds 
working capital and other balance sheet changes in  working capital was generated by operating activities  equipment sales  and proceeds under a revolving credit facility established in current liabilities increased primarily due to an increase in costs accrued in advance of upcoming shipyard activities related to maintenance of vessels 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined from at december  to at december  maritrans utilized available working capital to purchase marine vessels and equipment  repay scheduled long term debt obligations  and make dividend payments 
debt obligations and borrowing facility at december   maritrans had million in total outstanding debt  secured by mortgages on substantially all of the fixed assets of the subsidiaries of the corporation 
the current portion of this debt at december   was million 
maritrans has a million working capital facility  secured by receivables and inventories of a subsidiary  which expires june   and which it expects to renew 
this facility was not used in on october   maritrans entered into a multi year revolving credit facility for amounts up to million with mellon bank  na this facility is collateralized by mortgages on tankers acquired in maritrans initially borrowed million under this facility on november   and had million remaining outstanding at december  at december  and  total debt to total capitalization was percent and percent  respectively 
for purposes of this calculation  total capitalization consists of long term debt  including those portions that are current  and stockholders equity 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  those programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if left unchanged  this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal similar business activities 
the company completed an assessment of its computing systems within the last few years and has begun rewriting software programs and replacing systems to take advantage of newer technology 
as a result of this initiative over the past few years  the company s operating systems will be year compliant upon completion of these upgrades  which are scheduled to occur by december  this date is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the total remaining cost of this initiative is approximately million  of which most is for the purchase of new software and which will be capitalized 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year conversions are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to upgrade all relevant operating systems  and similar uncertainties 
earnings per common share in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 earnings per share 
statement replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share 
unlike primary earnings per share  basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effect of outstanding stock options 
because of the company s capital structure  diluted earnings per share is very similar to the previously reported earnings per share 
earnings per common share amounts for all periods have been presented  and where appropriate  restated to conform to statement requirements 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income and statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  both of which are required to be adopted on january  statement requires financial statement reporting of all non owner related changes in equity for the periods being presented 
statement requires disclosure of revenue  earnings and other financial information pertaining to business segments by which a company is managed  as well as factors used by management to determine segments 
the company believes adoption of statement will have no effect on its financial reporting and is currently evaluating the requirements of statement to determine the impact it will have on financial statement disclosures
