item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has historically engaged in providing outsourced staffing services engineering  technical  and airport management to agencies of the united states government  government prime contractors  and local government agencies 
to broaden its existing outsourced staffing services business  the company acquired a commercial outsourced staffing services company in august during the past four years  the company  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  has invested more of its corporate resources in expanding its wireless communications products business area 
this effort has resulted in comarco realizing the majority of its operating income from this business area 
summarized financial information by business segment for the company s fiscal year  which ended january   is as follows wireless outsourced communications staffing services products and other revenue corporate and other total dollars in thousands revenues    operating income   identifiable assets     o wireless communications products the company s wireless communications products business  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  is presently comprised of three product families field measurement products  revenue assurance products and wireless applications products 
o field measurement products provide a method for benchmarking and analyzing the performance of wireless system networks 
the field measurement product line includes the generation ii cellular survey system  the nes network evaluation system  the nrs network readiness system  the cdpd data survey product  and the company s latest product introductions  the lt and lt  which permits day to day network performance monitoring of cellular and pcs networks 
o the revenue assurance product line includes system products and services that test the integrity of cellular carriers billing systems 
o wireless applications products include ireless data telemetry systems and emergency roadside callbox systems 
the company s wireless data telemetry system is the cellular data gateway that is used to transport data and is optimized for wide area applications 
in october  the company purchased certain callbox produc line assets from gte 
the installed base purchased from gte consists of over  units  of which approximately  are being serviced by the company under long term mainte nance contracts 
in addition  in february  the company acquired certain assets of the cubic communications  inc callbox product line 
the installed base purchased from cubic communica tions consists of approximately  units 
management believes that the combination of these two product lines establishes the company as a major vendor to this niche of the wireless applica tion products marketplace 
comarco wireless technologies revenues increased to of the company s total revenue in fiscal year  representing an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
operating income increased year to year and represented over of the company s consolidated operating income for fiscal year continued growth in comarco wireless revenues and income is predicated on a number of factors  including the continued success of the company s product development efforts  continued geographical expansion to international markets  continued growth and increased availability of cellular and other wireless communication services  including pcs  in the united states and internationally  and continued acceptance of the company s products by its customers  none of which can be assured 
international revenues in fiscal year totaled million  up from million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these sales have been made to europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a significant part of total revenues 
marketing and post contract customer support offices are opened and staffed in singapore and london  england 
product development the company continues its product development program in its wireless communications business 
because a common thread of technology runs through all comarco wireless product lines  the company believes that it can leverage its investment and maintain the focus and concentration of its technical and marketing resources  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company in general has been developing and plans to continue to develop products that will be compatible with all wireless communications air interfaces worldwide 
new product introductions this year included adding other air interfaces to the company s line of field measurement and revenue assurance products including cdma  gsm  pc  and is and further expansion of the company s lt line with the introduction of the lt the company s wireless product life cycle is estimated to be two to five years  depending on the product 
the company is also continuing its development of a new product line  a power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones 
the objective of this product is to be smaller  lighter and more versatile than existing products on the market and is based on the company s patented power transfer technology 
the product has recently completed both fcc and ul testing  but the company has not commenced the sale of this product 
potential customers would include after market and original equipment manufacturers 
the company s current strategy is to initially pursue after market customers 
the power requirements of laptop computers are increasing due to the introduction of more powerful microprocessors 
this factor will require the company to continue its product development program to increase the power capacity of its power adapter products 
the company believes that the higher power adapter is the product that may also appeal to original equipment manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in bringing this power adapter product to market  or that this product will be successful 
the company is aware that the power supply market is extremely competitive 
if the company is successful  the production  marketing  and sale of this product will require a significant amount of working capital for the financing of inventory and accounts receivable arising from sales of the product 
the company plans to continue to invest substantially in product development efforts 
its products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing products in a timely and cost effective manner and to identify  develop  and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and standards and meet customer needs in the wireless communications marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to technological advances  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  and any significant delays in development  introduction or shipment of products  or achievement of acceptable product costs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company s wireless communications business capitalized approximately million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
of the amounts capitalized  million and million  respectively  were amortized in fiscal years and against product sales in accordance with statement no 
in addition  during fiscal years   and  comarco wireless had expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  for research and development expenses including company sponsored software development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility 
backlog unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  are approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance includes million of product orders for the field measurement and revenue assurance product lines  and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
management believes that substantially all of this backlog amount of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s product orders are filled within months from the receipt of the order 
the remaining unfilled orders of million are related to the callbox product line 
this backlog balance consists of million of new product orders  million of long term maintenance agreements  and the remaining million is to upgrade the los angeles county callbox system to comply with the americans with disabilities act s requirements for use by hearing and speech impaired individuals 
the company currently expects the majority of the los angeles contract to be performed late in fiscal year and continue into fiscal year seasonality fluctuation in quarterly results comarco wireless has experienced  in each of the past four years  a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the latter half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half of the fiscal year  although this trend has been declining over the same four years 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  capacity and production constraints associated with single source component suppliers  and other competitive factors 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
marketing  sales distribution  foreign sales comarco wireless maintains its own internal sales force for the marketing and sales of the company s product offerings in the united states 
the company has established a network of agents and distributors for the coordination of sales activity outside of the united states 
in addition  the company has opened and staffed marketing and customer support offices in singapore and london  england to service asia pacific and europe  respectively 
this expansion overseas faces a number of inherent barriers  including the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade restrictions  changes in laws governing the imposition of duties  quotas  taxes  or other charges relating to the import or export of its products  political and economic instability  the difficulty of administering business globally  longer accounts receivable cycles  and currency exchange fluctuations 
the company currently has limited experience in penetrating the foreign marketplace and  therefore  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have a competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s international sales efforts will be successful 
the company currently sells to its major customers under purchase orders that are usually placed with short term delivery requirements 
therefore  the company maintains significant inventory levels and associated production and technical staff in order to respond to the short term delivery requirements 
if the customer orders  as forecasted  do not materialize or are delayed  the company will have higher levels of inventory than otherwise needed  increasing the risk of obsolescence 
the higher levels of inventory and production and technical staffing would also reduce the company s liquidity and profitability 
the company s standard terms require foreign customers to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
as such  a strengthening of the us dollar as compared to a foreign customer s local currency effectively increases the cost of the company s products for that customer  thereby making the company s products less attractive to that customer 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  the company has limited its exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
such activity to date has been insignificant 
there can be no assurance that a currency hedging strategy will be successful in avoiding exchange related losses in the future 
significant weakness in foreign currency exchange rates can also create economic uncertainty  including weakness in banking systems and equity markets 
such weaknesses can impact customers demand for the company s products and their ability to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
therefore  any significant change in a foreign country s exchange rates  economy  or a deterioration of us trade relations or the economies or political stability of foreign locations in which the company sells its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
capital requirements comarco wireless working capital needs primarily consist of the cost of the upfront product development effort required to expand the company s product offerings  inventory requirements  including long lead time materials  and the financing of accounts receivable  which will generally become longer upon the company s continued planned geographical expansion into europe  asia pacific and latin america 
certain components used by the company in its existing products are only available from single sources  and certain other components are presently available or acquired only from a limited number of suppliers 
the radio interface devices designed into the company s products are key purchased components whose lack of availability could have a material adverse impact on sales and profits 
in the event that any of its single source suppliers are unable to fulfill company requirements or discontinue the manufacture of a key component  the company would be required to purchase a comparable component from other sources and modify its products to function properly with the replacement component or redesign its products to use other components  either of which could result in delays in production and delivery 
working capital requirements are expected to be financed from operations and the financial resources of the company 
comarco wireless also operates from a single site manufacturing operation 
any material disruption in the manufacturing operations of comarco wireless  whether due to fire  natural disasters  or otherwise  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
technical requirements comarco wireless is selling its products into a market that is growing rapidly and subject to technological obsolescence  and market timing of product introductions is critical for success 
in the development of new or expanded product offerings  the company s access to the technical design of air interface devices is essential for the company to anticipate and develop compatible wireless communications products 
the inability to obtain the technical designs on a timely basis will have a direct impact on product design and schedule and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
employees as of april   comarco wireless employed approximately employees 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
recognizing this reality  the company has instituted a long term incentive stock option plan for key comarco wireless employees  whereby they will directly participate in the success of comarco wireless see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company obtains its employees through a variety of means including advertisements  technical job fairs  engineering recruiters  and engineering temporary staffing firms 
competition comarco wireless competes in small niches field measurement equipment  revenue assurance equipment  and emergency roadside callboxes of the wireless communications marketplace 
the business is competitive and there are other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources  who provide or could provide the same type of products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the rate at which customers accept the company s products in overseas markets  product quality and performance  experienced sales and marketing personnel  rapid development of new products and features  evolving industry standards  and the number and nature of the company s competitors 
the company believes there are companies that provide or have the ability to provide the products the company is planning for overseas users 
also  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage in penetrating those markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future  either domestically or internationally 
proprietary information the company has one patent for its small power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones  and patents covering its emergency roadside callbox product 
however  the company currently relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect its intellectual property in the wireless products area 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede third party development of its technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
o outsourced staffing services and other revenue these services are primarily in the fields of o information technologies o intelligent instrumentation and automated test systems o ordnance and weapon systems engineering services o airport management services o commercial staffing services o manufacturing training approximately million or of the company s revenues  and approximately million of its operating income after a million non recurring charge for write off of intangible assets  for the fiscal year ended january  were derived from contracts and subcontracts for such services

backlog the company s backlog from outsourced staffing services and other revenue believed to be firm as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  the source of backlog is primarily contracts with the us and local governments 
government contracts normally have a base and option periods totaling three to five years in duration 
in many instances  government entities must issue work orders  delivery orders  or task orders prior to the company commencing work 
these entities have the discretion to terminate any contract at their convenience  and are normally obligated only to pay for costs incurred to date under a contract 
in addition  these entities may elect to remove funding previously attached to a contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year  with options to provide services for additional periods of time 
there can be no assurances that the government entities will exercise the options  will not withdraw funds already committed  or that the entities will fund the unfunded portions of the company s contracts 
it is estimated that approximately of the firm backlog will be realized in fiscal year government contracts a significant portion of the company s total revenues approximately in fy  in fy  and in fy was derived from contracts with the united states government  principally agencies of the department of defense 
significant portions of the company s revenues are derived from contracts with the us military services department of defense   us army   us navy   and us air force  
should changes in procurement policies or reductions in government expenditures occur  revenue and net income of the company could be adversely affected see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s government contracts business is not seasonal  however variations may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
further  the federal government is increasing its use of general services administration multiple award schedules gsa mas and other very broad based contract vehicles to acquire information technology related services 
the company has responded to this shift in its federal government market by successfully obtaining awards of its own gsa mas in february and teaming with other companies on similar vehicles they have obtained 
as of april  orders under these vehicles total approximately  since september in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
in march  the company announced the award of a contract with a value of million to continue to provide engineering and management services to the us navy at crane  indiana 
this contract  along with the contract awards during fiscal year with award values of approximately million  were recompetitions of work the company was already performing 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
the company s airport contract at reagan washington national airport ends at september  the company has decided not to pursue the recompete of this contract 
this contract s annual revenues approximate million  it has been marginally profitable  and it would be unprofitable if reawarded to the company 
two other multi year government contracts are scheduled to end in fiscal year with annual revenues of approximately million 
the company plans to aggressively compete for its existing work and selectively pursue other high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded work under any future proposals 
competition approximately of the company s outsourced staffing services and other revenue business is awarded through competitive procurements 
government contracting services industries consist of thousands of companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company  who can provide the same type of services 
the business is highly competitive 
the company obtains much of its business on the basis of submitted proposals to new and existing customers 
competition generally centers on price  past performance  technical capability  management plan  and personnel 
there is no single company that competes directly with the company on all of the company s services and products 
proprietary information the united states government has certain proprietary rights in software programs and products developed by the company in its performance of government contracts 
employees as of april   the company employed approximately full time employees  of which were part of the outsourced staffing services business area 
in addition  the company has approximately employees on a full time equivalent basis working as temporaries in its commercial outsourced staffing business 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
approximately of the company s employees in this business area at reagan washington national airport are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
item properties the company s principal facilities on january   aggregating approximately  square feet  are located in the cities of yorba linda  irvine  camarillo  victorville  corona  and ridgecrest  california  vienna and petersburg  virginia  sierra vista  arizona  warner robins  georgia  bloomfield  indiana  colorado springs  colorado  huntsville  alabama  gaithersburg  maryland  belton  texas  london  england  and singapore  and are occupied under leases expiring prior to fiscal year with the exception of an  square foot area used for light manufacturing  all facilities are used for office space

the company is involved in two distinct business areas development and manufacture of wireless communications products and services  and providing outsourced staffing services including engineering  technical  and airport management services to government and commercial entities 
fiscal year revenues totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to o sales of the company s wireless communications products  including various field measurement  revenue assurance  and emergency roadside callbox systems o full year versus one half year in the prior year from the acquisition of a million per year commercial staffing business 
operating income for fiscal year increased to million after the effect of a 
million non recurring  non cash charge for the write off of the remaining intangible assets associated with the company s outsourced staffing services software development operation  up from million last year 
before this non recurring charge  operating income was million  up compared to the same period last year 
increased operating income is primarily due to increased sales of wireless communication systems as noted above 
wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for the comparable period last year 
wireless communication product revenues comprised approximately of total company revenues during fiscal year  up from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s field measurement  revenue assurance  and emergency callbox systems 
the rapid growth of cellular and pcs markets and proliferation of numerous digital air interfaces is driving demand for the company s products worldwide 
during fiscal year  the company s product introductions included adding other air interfaces  such as cdma  gsm  pc  and is these product introductions fueled a significant increase in international sales for comarco wireless to approximately million or of fiscal year revenues 
operating income from wireless communications products increased to million  up year to year and comprised approximately of the company s total operating income for fiscal year summary operating results for comarco wireless technologies  inc  the company s wireless communications products subsidiary  are as follows january  january  product   sales cost of products sold   gross margin   percentage indirect costs   operating income   indirect costs include selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as research and development expenses 
the decreased gross margin percentage is due to the increased costs incurred to increase the capacity of the wireless communications products business  which included additional staffing  moving to a larger facility in california  associated costs to support future anticipated higher sales levels  and the addition of the emergency roadside callbox product lines which have lower gross margins than the field measurement and revenue assurance product families 
the increase in indirect costs is primarily due to the additional selling and general administrative costs associated with international expansion during fiscal year selling and general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal year  up from the comparable period last year 
research and development expense totaled million during fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating future revenue from such development efforts 
operating income increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues is for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the year to year decrease is primarily due to the increased costs related to business expansion and the addition of the lower margin callbox product line  as discussed above 
the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications products business 
in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million in fiscal year  respectively 
these amounts are in addition to the research and development expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products totaled million for fiscal year  compared with million during fiscal year included within the above totals are million and million of long term maintenance service business associated with the purchase of the cubic communications and gte callbox product lines during fiscal year and  respectively 
unfilled orders at january  totaled million  of which million is associated with the long term maintenance contracts and million is associated with post contract customer support obligations which has been recorded as deferred revenue 
in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop entitled software revenue recognition 
this statement updates sop which was issued in  and it provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized and in what amounts for licensing  selling  leasing  or otherwise marketing computer software 
the provisions of the new statement are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal year the company has not completed its analysis of the impact on the financial statements that will be caused by the adoption of this statement 
in february  the company acquired an additional callbox product line from cubic communications  inc this acquisition  coupled with the prior acquisition of the gte callbox product line  establishes comarco wireless technologies as one of the leading companies in the callbox niche of the wireless communications industry 
the company has experienced fluctuations in wireless communications products activity in each of the past four years  with greater sales in the second half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half  although this trend has been declining over the same four years 
this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its product offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
outsourced staffing services and other revenue revenues provided by the outsourced staffing services business area increased in fiscal year  totaling million compared to million in the prior year 
the increased revenue of year to year is due to the acquisition of the commercial outsourced staffing company on august   which contributed million of revenue in fiscal year  versus million during fiscal year sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were and of the company s total revenue during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
in march  the company announced the award of a contract with an award value of million to continue to provide engineering and management services to the us navy at crane  indiana 
this contract  along with the contract awards during fiscal year with award values of approximately million  were recompetition of work the company was already performing 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
in addition  the company began work on a long term airport services contract in february for riverside county  california and on another contract in may for tacoma narrows airport  tacoma  washington 
the company s airport contract at reagan washington national airport ends on september  the company has decided not to pursue the recompete of this contract 
this contract s annual revenues approximate million  it has been marginally profitable  and it would be unprofitable if reawarded to the company 
two other multi year government contracts are scheduled to end in fiscal year with annual revenues of approximately million 
the company plans to aggressively compete for this other work opened for competition to the extent possible and selectively pursue certain high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded the work associated with any of its future proposals 
in addition  government agencies may terminate their contracts in whole or in part at their convenience 
government agencies may remove funding previously provided or may not exercise option periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the government will fund the portions of existing contracts that are unfunded  or that the governmental agencies will exercise any options 
in january  the company recorded a  charge against earnings from the impairment of certain assets of its outsourced staffing software development operation 
this charge was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based upon recent marketing initiatives which proved unsuccessful in the fourth quarter  the company determined that the expected future cash flows were not sufficient to cover the remaining unamortized intangible assets
