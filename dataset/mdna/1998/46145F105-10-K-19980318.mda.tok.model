the year issue overview computer systems and software products were originally designed to accept only two digit entries in the data code field 
as a result  certain computer systems and software packages will not be able to interpret dates beyond december  and thus will interpret dates beginning january  to represent january  this could potentially result in computer failure or miscalculations  causing operating disruptions  including an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business operations 
therefore  companies may have to upgrade or replace computer and software systems in order to comply with the year requirements 
itg s strategy the company is well aware of and is actively addressing the year issue and the potential problems that can arise in any computer and software system 
planning and evaluation work began in including the identification of those systems affected 
the company has engaged a consultant to provide advice on year issues and to assist the company in its efforts to meet industry standards

total costs for the whole project are estimated to be between and million  which includes the cost of personnel  consultants and software and hardware costs 
the year issue however  can affect all businesses that use computers 
accordingly  if the year issue adversely affects the company s customers  this in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s trading revenues and collections 
should the company  third party information vendors  other third party electronic vendors  or the company s customers fail to adequately address this issue  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
jefferies group and the company announce intention to consider separating into two independent companies on march   jefferies group and the company jointly announced that they are considering the separation of jefferies co 
and other jefferies group subsidiaries from the company through a spin off 
if the separation is completed  jefferies group shareholders will own of jefco and approximately of the company 
the public company shareholders will continue to own of the company 
the company percentage ownership interests could change slightly as a result of the company s stock repurchases or issuances before the transaction closing date 
the spin off will be accomplished by a tax free distribution of of the shares of a new company  jefco  to jefferies group shareholders 
jefferies group s million shares of the company would then be its only asset 
the spin off would be followed immediately by a tax free merger of jefferies group and the company  with the company s public shareholders receiving shares of jefferies group 
jefferies group would then be renamed investment technology group  inc the spin off and restructuring transactions are contingent on a number of factors  including receipt of all board of directors and shareholder approvals of jefferies group and the company  receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the internal revenue service and other required regulatory and contractual approvals
