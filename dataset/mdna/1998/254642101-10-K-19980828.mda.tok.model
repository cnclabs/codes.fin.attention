as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company reached an agreement in july to settle a lawsuit brought by airgas  inc and certain airgas affiliates against several defendants  including the company and one of its employees 
as a result of the settlement  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects the payments made pursuant to the terms of the actual settlement plus associated legal and professional fees 
other income for fiscal primarily includes a million fee received from the termination of the proposed acquisition of hi lo automotive  inc  less related expenses 
interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily the result of increased borrowings associated with new store growth  the expansion of the company s existing distribution center  and the september funding of the amounts due pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with airgas 
the company s effective tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal was primarily as a result of the foregoing  net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share as compared to million or

excluding the impact of commercial freon sales in fiscal  the gross margin would have been for fiscal the reduction in fiscal traditional diy gross margin was primarily the result of the continuing effects of the decrease in retail pricing which occurred late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and higher promotional markdowns which resulted from increased advertising efforts in the second half of fiscal sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million over such expenses for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
this decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the higher levels of commercial sales of r freon in fiscal  which had relatively low sg a expenses 
the decrease was offset in part by an increase in net advertising expense 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company reached an agreement in july to settle a lawsuit brought by airgas  inc and certain airgas affiliates against several defendants  including the company and one of its employees 
as a result of the settlement  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charge reflects the payments made pursuant to the terms of the actual settlement plus associated legal and professional fees 
other income primarily includes gains and losses on real estate disposals and interest income 
the decrease in fiscal in other income is primarily attributable to the lower amount of net real estate gains of approximately  in fiscal as compared to million of net real estate gains in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily the result of increased average borrowings associated with new store growth 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal after reflecting the charge associated with the airgas litigation settlement  net income for fiscal was million or 
per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share reported for fiscal excluding the impact of the litigation settlement and all related expenses  net income would have been million or per diluted share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the overall decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of the funding of the airgas settlement in fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally the result of an increase in net income  substantial deferred income tax expense in fiscal as compared to a deferred income tax benefit in fiscal  inventory growth in fiscal at a level substantially less than in fiscal  an increase in the amount of depreciation and an increase in current liabilities  offset in part by the funding of the airgas settlement  a decrease in the amount of increase in accounts payable and additional increases in the amounts of prepaid expenses and other current assets 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the fiscal capital expenditures related to the new stores opened during that period and costs associated with a major expansion of the company s distribution center  which involves an increase of the company s existing distribution center from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet 
most of the expansion project has been completed and the balance of the project is principally a significant addition of office space 
the total cost of the expansion is estimated to be approximately to million 
through june  the company has spent approximately million on the distribution center expansion project 
the company also began the rollout of a commercial delivery service in the third quarter of fiscal the company s commercial delivery service consists of a program whereby commercial customers such as auto service centers  commercial mechanics  garages and the like establish commercial accounts with the company and order automotive parts from the company with such parts being delivered from  or picked up from  nearby discount auto parts stores 
during fiscal  the company s entry into the commercial delivery market involved total capital expenditures of approximately million 
in addition  the commercial delivery program has required  and can be expected to continue to require  the company to extend trade credit to certain of the commercial account customers in the ordinary course of business 
the extension of such trade credit increases the capital requirements associated with the rollout of the program and exposes the company to credit risk and the associated loss attributable to uncollectible accounts 
the company has established systems to manage and control such credit risk 
the amount of capital that is needed for extension of trade credit will be dependent in large part upon the success of the commercial delivery service roll out and how quickly the commercial business develops 
because this is a relatively new aspect of the auto parts supply business for the company  there are risks associated with the company s entry into this new aspect of the business and there can be no assurance as to if and or when the commercial delivery service business will be profitable or as to whether the company will experience any financial or other challenges in managing and controlling the credit risk 
the company anticipates that total capital expenditures for fiscal  including the costs associated with the addition of approximately new stores  the distribution center expansion and the working capital costs associated with the roll out of the commercial delivery service  will be in the range of million to million 
the company s credit facilities are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of june   the company had million of additional availability under its existing revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the company has historically been able to finance most of its new store growth through unsecured lines of credit and medium and longer term mortgage financing provided by banks and other institutional lenders  and through cash flow from operations 
consistent with its historical practice  the company expects to finance both its short and long term liquidity needs for new store growth  as to land and buildings  primarily through these lines of credit and mortgage financing renewals and replacements thereof  and as to equipment and fixtures  primarily through cash flow from operations 
the company s new store development program also requires significant working capital  principally for inventories 
the company has historically used trade credit to partially finance new store inventories and has been successful in negotiating extended payment terms and incentives from many suppliers through volume purchases 
the company believes that it will be able to continue financing some of its inventory growth through the extension of favorable payment terms and incentives from its vendors  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the additional funding for inventory expansion has been provided in large part from cash flow from operations 
as of june   or of the company s stores were leased 
although the company generally anticipates a similar own lease percentage relationship for new stores in the future  the company may explore opportunities which could lead to increases in this percentage 
the company believes that the expected cash flows from operations  available bank borrowings and trade credit  will be sufficient to fund both short term and long term capital and liquidity needs of the company 
inflation and seasonality the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
the company has been successful  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs  economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  and selective forward buying 
although sales have historically been somewhat higher in the company s fourth quarter march through may  the company does not consider its business to be seasonal 
year management has developed a plan to modify the company s information technology to recognize the year and has begun converting critical data processing systems 
the company s year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff and management 
management currently expects the project to be substantially complete by early and that the cost of the year initiative  principally including internal costs  will not be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
furthermore  this project is not expected to have a significant effect on operations 
forward looking statements the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion contains forward looking statements which reflect the current views of the company with respect to certain events that could have an effect on the company s future financial performance 
these statements include the words anticipates  expects  expected  and believes  variations of such words and similar expressions which are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
any such forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those currently anticipated 
the future operating results of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including without limitation the following competition the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace particularly in florida  in which it competes primarily with national and regional auto parts chains  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national auto parts distributors or associations  automobile dealers and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  products and accessories 
some of the company s current and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
store growth an important part of the company s business plan is an aggressive store growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  lease and or acquire favorable store sites  hire and train team members  and adapt its management and operational systems to the extent necessary to fulfill its expansion plans 
the failure to open new stores in accordance with its growth plans could have an adverse impact on the company s future performance 
earnings growth the company has experienced  and may experience in the future  fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that discount auto parts will be able to realize sales and earnings growth in any particular quarter consistent with its past performance or with investors expectations 
factors such as the number of new store openings  extent of the market demand for auto parts  availability of inventory supply  propriety of inventory mix  adequacy and perception of customer service  product quality and defect experience  availability of and ability to take advantage of vendor pricing programs and incentives  rate of new store openings  cannibalization of store sites  mix of types of merchandise sold  governmental regulation  new store development  performance of information systems  effectiveness of deliveries from the distribution center  ability to hire  train and retain qualified team members  availability of quality store sites  ability to complete timely expansion of the distribution center  ability to successfully roll out the commercial delivery service  credit risk associated with the commercial delivery service  environmental risks  availability of expanded and extended credit facilities  legal expenses associated with material matters and disputes  expenses associated with investigations concerning freon matters  potential for liability with respect to these matters and other risks could contribute to this quarterly variability 
effective upgrading of systems the growth in the company s business has placed significant demand on the management and operational systems of the company 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to continue to upgrade its operational and financial systems  expand its management team and increase and manage its team members 
there can be no assurance that such upgrades and expansions will be effectuated successfully  on a timely basis and or without disruption 
disputes and investigations in the normal course of business  the company is subject to regulations  proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including matters under laws and regulations related to the environment and health and safety  among others 
in particular  certain federal investigations are currently ongoing with respect to the matters which were the subject of the company s settlement with airgas and certain airgas affiliates 
these matters and any other matters that may be pending or may arise in the future are subject to the resolution of many uncertainties  and accordingly  outcomes are not predictable with any assurance 
although the company believes that amounts provided in its financial statements and its reserves are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurance that the amounts required to discharge alleged liabilities from lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings will not materially impact future operating results 
vendor relationships the company s business is dependent upon close relationships with its vendors at favorable prices and on favorable terms  including those offered through financial incentives such as cooperative advertising arrangements and other marketing incentive programs and non financial benefits such as improved packaging and distribution accommodations 
a disruption of these vendor relationships could adversely affect the company s business 
liquidity the company s business continues to be capital intensive 
it continues to be the company s preference to own rather than lease store locations 
additionally  the expansion of the company s headquarters and main distribution facility  its entrance into the commercial delivery market  and the continued plans for upgrading its information systems to more efficiently run the business will continue to require capital 
accordingly  the company will require substantial capital expenditures to fund these items during the next several years in order to achieve its operating and expansion plans 
although the company believes that its existing credit facilities coupled with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company anticipated capital expenditures over the next several years  there can be no assurance that such amounts will be sufficient or that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms
