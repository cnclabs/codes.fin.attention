for customer contact monitoring  the company generally charges a fee per call monitored  determined by the duration of the call  aggregate number of calls  and other relevant variables 
for employment process administration contracts  the company charges a per unit fee  which varies depending upon whether the client only needs one type of service  such as employee background checks  or an entire recruitment and hiring process 
individual services generally are also provided on a per unit fee basis  while more complete services typically include a base fee component and a per unit fee 
compensation survey services are provided at a fixed price per survey or per service provided 
the company s clients generally use its services on an as needed basis  requiring the company to be able to respond quickly to changes in the volume of services it must provide at a given time 
the company has taken a variety of steps in order to address the operational challenges this situation presents and increase its ability to control its cost of services 
for example  the company engages many professionals  including a number of its psychologists  on a part time basis  which enables it to have access to a large number of staff on relatively short notice without incurring significant fixed labor expenses 
the company also cross trains its employees on multiple aspects of the delivery of its services  giving the company as much flexibility as possible when staffing a particular client engagement

with respect to assessment and selection  while these services typically are provided by experienced staff who have masters or doctoral degrees  the relatively high payroll expense associated with such personnel is offset by higher pricing for the services they provide 
automated systems have also helped to increase the efficiencies of the assessment and selection processes
