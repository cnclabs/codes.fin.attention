the company declared dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in environment dow s global operations are subject to increasingly stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation 
dow s environmental responsibilities and potential liabilities receive direct and ongoing scrutiny by management to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 
dow s environmental management standard clearly defines the overall environmental management system  performance objectives and design requirements needed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection as well as to comply with these laws and regulations 
it is dow s stated policy that all global operations and products meet dow s environmental management standard or their country s laws and regulations  whichever is more stringent 
assessments are used by management to continually measure and report dow s progress against this standard and its performance objectives 
since  the company has received third party certification at three of its european sites confirming that dow s environmental management system meets iso and eco management and auditing system emas specifications 
it has been dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal incineration means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities 
wastes that are recycled  treated or recovered for energy off site represent less than percent of the total amount of wastes reported as part of the pollution prevention act 
dow s policy of on site waste treatment has resulted in less than percent of its total environmental liability being directed at remediation under federal or state superfund statutes 
in  dow announced a number of voluntary global environment  health and safety eh s goals for the year included are goals to reduce emissions and wastes by percent base year and eh s incidents by percent 
most performance metrics are on or ahead of the goal schedule 
the goals  as well as other performance data  can be found in dow s eh s progress report 
dow accrues the costs of site remediation for its facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
in the case of a landfill  dow accrues the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the nature of such remediation includes the cleanup of soil contamination and the closure of landfills and other waste management facilities 
the policies adopted to reflect properly the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
raven group ltd  a joint venture established in  provides strategic management to identify cost effective solutions for certain remediation liabilities at dow s us manufacturing locations 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow has been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal or state superfund statutes at approximately sites 
dow readily cooperates in remediation at sites where its liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
however  at several of these superfund sites  dow has had no known involvement and is contesting all liability  at many others  dow disputes major liability  believing its responsibility to be de minimis 
because current law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies which have also been named prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
page environment continued management has estimated that the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december   was million  which has been accrued 
in addition  receivables of million for probable third party recoveries have been recorded related to superfund sites 
other recoveries for past expenditures are possible since dow has numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times that may provide coverage at different levels for environmental liabilities 
the company is currently involved in litigation to determine the scope and extent of such coverage 
in addition to the superfund related liability referenced above  dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the company had not recorded as a receivable any third party recovery related to these sites 
in total  dow s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in the charges for included future incremental operations  maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard see note b to the financial statements

year dow has established a plan to address what many call the year challenge  specifically  the fact that many computing and control systems will not accurately interpret dates after december  since early  a year project team has been dedicated to making dow s systems and businesses ready for the next millennium 
the project team s responsibilities include assessing the potential impact of the year issue on the company s systems and operations  developing action plans to address the needs and issues identified  ascertaining the resources required and establishing a time phased work plan  which will include systems tests to determine year compliance 
year and the required system modifications are not expected to materially affect the company s business operations or consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional exposure within established limits and policies 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global scale  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts and over the counter option contracts 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the deutsche mark  swiss franc and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to the japanese yen  deutsche mark  dutch guilder and other european currencies 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
chemical feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
the risk of these hedging instruments is not material 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued as a result of acquisition and divestiture activity  the company has a portfolio of equity securities 
the major part of this exposure is related to restricted stock warrants 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
dow uses value at risk var stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation move in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity and earnings of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on the variance covariance statistical model 
as an example  the var for one day  using a percent confidence level at december   for foreign exchange  interest rate and equity exposures  net of hedges was foreign exchange million  interest rate million  and equity million
