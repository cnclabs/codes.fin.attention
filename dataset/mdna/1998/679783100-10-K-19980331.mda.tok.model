oggi s insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the insurance laws of the state of domicile as to the amount of dividends or other distributions they may pay to the oggi without the prior approval of the state regulatory authority 
under pennsylvania law  the maximum amount that may generally be paid by an insurance company during any twelve month period after notice to  but without prior approval of  the department cannot exceed the greater of of the insurance company s statutory surplus as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with the department  or the net income of the insurance company for the period covered by such annual statement

year issue the unprecedented advances in computer technology over the past several decades have resulted in dramatic changes in the way companies do business 
most of these developments have been beneficial  but some have proven costly  as businesses have struggled to adapt to various features of the new technological landscape 
one such well publicized problem has arisen out of the worldwide use of the so called year programming convention  in which two digit numbers were generally used instead of four digit numbers to identify the years used in dates 
as a consequence  most computers require relatively costly reprogramming to enable them to correctly perform data operations involving years or later  a problem anticipated to have substantial repercussions on the business world because computer operations involving date calculations are pervasive 
beginning in  the group began evaluating and reprogramming its own computer systems to address the year problem 
by the end of  all necessary programming work was completed and implemented 
with the completion of these changes  year issues are not likely to result in any material adverse disruption in the group s computer systems or its internal business operations 
the cost of this work through was approximately  to ensure that all software applications are year compliant  the group is currently testing all applications in a true year environment 
this testing is being conducted on hardware and system operating software that has the operating system date beyond this project is scheduled to be completed by june  it is estimated that the total remaining cost to complete this phase and become year compliant will be approximately  many experts now believe that the year problem may have a material adverse impact on the national and global economy generally  in addition  it seems likely that if businesses are materially damaged as a result of year problems  at least some such businesses may attempt to recoup their losses by claiming coverage under various types of insurance policies 
and  although management has concluded that under a fair reading of the various policies of insurance issued by it no coverage for year problems should be considered to exist  it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent any such coverage could ultimately be found to exist by courts in the various jurisdictions 
accordingly  important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the inability of the group to accurately estimate the impact of the year problem on the insurance issued by  or other business operations of the group 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis and other statements made throughout this report constitute forward looking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
such forward forwarding statements involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in or contemplated by the statements 
these assumptions  risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those associated with factors affecting the property casualty insurance industry generally  including price competition  size and frequency of claims  escalating damage awards  natural disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and general business conditions  the group s dependence on investment income  the geographic concentration of the group s business in the northeast united states  the adequacy of the group s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  government regulation of the insurance industry and the other risks and uncertainties discussed or indicated in all documents filed by the group with the securities and exchange commission 
the group expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the release of this report
