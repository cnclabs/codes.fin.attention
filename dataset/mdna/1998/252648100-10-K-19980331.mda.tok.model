there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the company will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  the forward looking statements of the company contained in this annual report on form k are subject to the following risks and uncertainties limited operating history the company was incorporated in may by a group consisting primarily of a group of former sears home improvement managers and globe  and commenced operations on june   when it entered into a license agreement with sears 
accordingly  the company s operating history is brief and may not serve as an accurate indicator of the company s future performance 
since its inception  the company has experienced substantial growth in revenue  and in the company s operating income decreased from levels 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue growth and profitability will be sustained 
dependence on sears license substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from sales of products and services under a license agreement between exteriors and sears 
the license agreement is not exclusive by its terms  however  historically  sears has not licensed the same home improvement products to multiple licensees within the same market 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that sears will not license the same home improvement products to other licensees within the company s markets 
as it has done in the past  the company expects to negotiate and revise its license agreement on terms that meet the company s three fundamental principles in dealing with sears top line growth  quality  and licensee profitability 
although in the past sears has either renewed or extended the license agreement with the company  there can be no assurance that the license agreement will be renewed or extended upon the license s scheduled expiration on december  termination of the license agreement or certain rights thereunder  the failure of sears to renew the license agreement with the company on its current terms  an increase in the rates of the license fee paid by the company to sears  the addition of other sears licensees marketing the company s products in the company s markets  sears s exercise of its right to discontinue the company s license in any market or for any product or a decline in sears s reputation could have a material adverse effect on the net sales and profitability of the company 
in addition  in the event the license agreement is terminated or expires  the company would need to find alternative methods to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the alternative methods would be as cost effective as advertising with sears and  to the extent such methods are not as cost effective  the company s net sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
see also sears license agreement under item warranty exposure the company provides each customer with a warranty on product and labor 
certain manufacturers product warranties often provide a declining amount of coverage over time  while the company s warranty coverage does not decline during the warranty period 
the labor warranty that the company receives from its independent roofing installers generally one to two years is significantly shorter in duration than that provided by the company to its roofing customers 
due to the company s limited operating history and the length of the warranties provided by the company  there can be no assurance that the warranty reserve is adequate 
in all cases  the company is liable to the customer to fulfill all warranty obligations  regardless of whether a manufacturer or independent installer performs its warranty obligations 
in addition  pursuant to the license agreement with sears i sears has the right to settle  at the company s expense and without the company s consent  any customer complaints  ii the company has agreed to and supports sears policy of satisfaction guaranteed or your money back as it relates to customer complaints and adjustments and iii the company s customers are third party beneficiaries of the product and labor warranty given by the company to sears with respect to each installation 
to the extent the amount of money spent to reimburse sears for customer complaint settlements or to satisfy customers under the satisfaction guaranteed or your money back policy  together with any warranty claims settled by the company materially exceeds the warranty reserve or if certain manufacturers or a significant number of independent installers are unable to fulfill their warranty obligations  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see also warranty under item 
reliance on sales associates the company s success depends upon its ability to identify  develop and retain qualified employees  particularly sales associates 
as a result  the company devotes significant resources to the training and development of its sales associates 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to identify  develop and retain qualified sales associates 
to the extent that the company does not successfully hire and retain qualified sales associates or they are unable to achieve anticipated performance levels  the company s ability to penetrate existing and new markets and  therefore  the company s sales growth could be significantly delayed or adversely affected 
the company has experienced significant turnover with respect to its sales associates in the past  because  among other reasons  the company s sales associates work on a commission only basis and  in certain regions of the country  the business is seasonal 
in  approximately of the sales associates generated approximately of net installed sales 
increased turnover and or loss of productive sales associates has a direct impact on net sales and profitability 
the turnover of sales associates results in increased recruitment and training costs and a lower than desired conversion rate of sales leads to sales 
to the extent that the turnover rate of sales associates continues or increases  or the company loses a significant number of its most productive sales associates  the net sales and profitability of the company could be adversely affected 
see also sales under item 
dependence on availability of qualified independent installers the company s success depends upon its ability to continue to hire independent installers possessing the technical skills  experience and financial stability necessary to meet the company s quality standards and to satisfy the company s insurance requirements 
because the company provides up to a year warranty for labor on certain products  hiring qualified independent installers who will perform the work in accordance with the company s specifications and predetermined quality standards is extremely important 
most of the company s independent installers also compete directly with the company and the company  to a lesser extent  competes with other home improvement companies for the services of independent installers 
the company only retains an independent installer at the time an installation is sold 
as a result  no independent installer is obligated to work for the company until the independent installer accepts an assignment 
in the past  the company has periodically had difficulty retaining a sufficient number of qualified independent installers  especially after periods of extreme weather in specific geographic areas due to increased demand 
there can be no assurance that qualified independent installers will continue to be available to  or choose to work for  the company in sufficient numbers to satisfy the company s installation requirements 
the company s policy requires that its independent installers satisfy the company s workers compensation  general liability and automotive insurance requirements 
in certain circumstances  independent installers have not carried or renewed their workers compensation and general liability insurance 
to the extent that independent installers do not carry the required insurance  the company could incur ultimate liability for any injury or damage claims 
see also independent installers under item interest rate and inflation sensitivity the ability to finance purchases on an affordable basis  of which the interest rate charged is a significant component  is an important part of a customer s decision to purchase the company s products 
as interest rates increase  customers often pay higher monthly payments which may make the company s products less affordable  and  as a result  the company s net sales and profitability may decrease 
dependence on availability of third party credit during  approximately of the company s sales were financed  and  of the sales which were financed  approximately were financed through sears and third party finance companies  including sears affiliates 
since the company s inception  the credit approval rate of sears and its affiliates for the company s customers has varied from time to time based on a variety of factors 
to the extent its customers are unable to obtain financing through sears and its affiliates or other third party finance companies  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
many of the company s customers who finance their purchases through marquise may be higher credit risks than the company s other customers due to various factors  including  among other things  their employment status and previous credit history  the absence or limited extent of their prior credit history or their limited financial resources 
consistent with the company s strategy  many customers who finance their purchases through marquise have not met and may not meet the credit underwriting criteria of third party finance companies 
consequently  providing financing to these customers will likely involve a higher incidence of default and increased delinquency rates and will involve greater servicing costs 
the company currently bears the credit risk on the purchases financed through marquise  unlike purchases financed through third party finance companies  such as sears affiliates 
marquise currently maintains a bad debt reserve for expected losses 
due to marquise s limited operating history and the company s limited experience in consumer financing  there can be no assurance that the bad debt reserve is adequate 
to the extent that losses materially exceed the bad debt reserve  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the credit performance of its customers will be at the expected level  that marquise s systems and controls will be adequate  that losses will be consistent with the expected bad debt experience or that the financing marquise has obtained will be sufficient to support its expanded operations 
see also customer financing under item dependence on key personnel the company is currently dependent upon the ability and experience of its executive officers and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain all of such officers 
the loss of a group of executives within a short period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
certain of the company s executive officers also hold executive positions and have responsibilities with globe  certain of its affiliates and other companies and expect to continue in these positions 
mr 
clegg  the company s chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  currently devotes and intends to devote a majority of his time to the management of the company 
the company does not have employment agreements with its executive officers 
the company does not maintain key man life insurance on any of its officers or key personnel 
highly competitive market the industry in which the company competes is large  fragmented and competitive 
the company competes for sales with numerous local home improvement installers and independent contractors in each of its markets  some of which also serve as independent installers for the company 
the company also competes against major retailers or manufacturers which market and install products similar to the company s 
the company expects that the market for its products and services will expand and  therefore  competition will increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain competitive or that the company will be able to maintain its current profitability 
see also competition under item seasonality  quarterly fluctuations the company s results of operations may fluctuate from year to year or quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors 
the company expects lower levels of sales and profitability during the period from mid november through mid march  impacting the first and fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition  the demand for the company s products and the company s results of operations may be affected by the severity of the weather

in certain jurisdictions  the company or one of its employees is required to be licensed as a contractor 
in addition  certain jurisdictions require the company or the independent installer to obtain a building permit for each installation 
in addition  such laws and regulations  may  among other things  regulate the company s advertising  warranties and disclosures to customers 
building codes  licensing requirements and safety laws vary from state to state and  in certain circumstances  limit the availability and supply of independent installers and impose additional costs on the company in complying with such laws 
although the company believes that it has been and is currently in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that in the future the company s results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by existing or new laws or regulations applicable to the company s business 
marquise is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which  among other things  require the company to i obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications  ii limit the interest rates  fees and other charges the company is allowed to charge  and iii limit or prescribe certain other terms of the company s credit applications and contracts 
moreover  individual states may require exteriors or marquise to make certain disclosures to consumers when consumer credit contracts are executed 
although the company believes that marquise has been and is currently in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that in the future a change in existing laws or regulations or the creation of new laws and regulations applicable to marquise s business will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to provide customer financing of its products or on the profitability of such activities
