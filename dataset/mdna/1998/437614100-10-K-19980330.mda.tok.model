item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless specifically stated otherwise  the following information relates to amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  without reduction for minority interests 
homestake reports per ounce production costs in accordance with the gold institute production cost standard 
results of operations homestake mining company homestake or the company recorded a net loss of million or per share during compared to net income of million or per share during and million or per share during the loss includes net nonrecurring expenses amounting to million or per share compared to net nonrecurring income of million or per share in and million or per share in nonrecurring items in included million million pretax write down of homestake s investment in the main pass sulfur mine million million pretax write down of certain investments million million pretax reduction in the carrying values of short lived mining properties million million pretax increase in the accrual for estimated future reclamation expenditures million million pretax in other charges  primarily foreign exchange losses on intercompany redeemable preferred stock and losses on an intercompany gold loan million million pretax gain on the fee received from santa fe pacific gold corporation santa fe upon termination of homestake s merger agreement with santa fe million million pretax gain on the sale of the george lake and back river joint venture interests in the northwest territories of canada nonrecurring items in included million reduction in the accrual for prior year income taxes million million pretax of proceeds from a litigation recovery million million pretax write down of mining investments million million pretax of foreign exchange losses primarily on advances to homestake s wholly owned subsidiary  homestake canada inc hci million million pretax of expenses related to the termination of homestake s proposed combination with santa fe nonrecurring items in included a gain of million million pretax on the sale of the company s remaining uranium inventory 
excluding the effect of the nonrecurring items  homestake incurred a net loss of million or per share in compared to earnings of million or per share in and million or per share in the lower results primarily are due to significantly lower gold prices  higher exploration expenditures and increased administrative and general expenses 
after adjusting for nonrecurring items  the reduction in earnings from reflects higher gold prices  higher gold production and sales volumes and lower per ounce total cash costs  offset by higher depreciation charges  substantially increased exploration expenditures and lower returns from the main pass sulfur operations 
gold operations the results of the company s operations are affected significantly by the market price of gold 
gold prices are influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  the relative strength of the united states dollar and certain other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political or economic crises  demand for gold for jewelry and industrial products  and sales by holders and producers of gold in response to these factors 
homestake s gold hedging policy provides for the use of forward sales contracts for up to of each of the following ten year s expected annual gold production at prices in excess of certain targeted prices  and the use of combinations of put and call option contracts to establish minimum floor prices while allowing participation in future increases in the price of gold 
in  homestake entered into a series of put and call options which provide a floor price of per ounce for  ounces of production while allowing for full participation in any increase in the price of gold above per ounce 
in  homestake sold for future delivery  at an average price of per ounce   ounces of the gold expected to be recovered from the mclaughlin mine stockpiles through during  the company delivered or financially settled  ounces of gold at an average realized price of per ounce under the mclaughlin program 
revenues in and include  and  ounces of gold sold at average prices of per ounce and per ounce  respectively  under the nickel plate mine hedging program which was completed in these hedging activities increased revenues by approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the estimated liquidation value of homestake s gold hedging position at december  was approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information and details of these hedging programs 
in february  prime adopted a gold and silver hedging policy which provides for the use of forward sales contracts for up to of each of the following five year s expected annual gold and silver production at prices in excess of certain targeted prices 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is incurred in australian and canadian currencies 
the company s profitability is impacted by fluctuations in these currencies exchange rates relative to the united states dollar 
under the company s foreign currency protection program  the company has entered into a series of foreign currency option contracts which establish trading ranges within which the united states dollar may be exchanged for australian and canadian dollars 
during  both the australian and canadian currencies weakened significantly in relation to the us dollar and the company recorded foreign currency losses of million under this program of which million were unrealized at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this program 
revenues from gold and ore sales totaled million during compared to revenues of million in and million in the decrease in revenue during reflects significantly lower gold prices partially offset by higher production 
the increase in revenues in from reflects higher sales volumes and higher gold prices 
during  the company sold  equivalent ounces of gold at an average price of per ounce compared to  equivalent ounces of gold sold at an average price of per ounce in and  equivalent ounces sold at an average price of per equivalent ounce during total gold production increased to  equivalent ounces during compared to  equivalent ounces produced during and  equivalent ounces produced during the higher production primarily is due to production increases at the kalgoorlie  eskay creek  snip and round mountain operations  the commencement of production at the la falda mine  and initial production at the ruby hill mine  partially offset by significantly lower production at the mclaughlin mine and the absence of production from the nickel plate mine 
the increase in production during from primarily is due to production increases at the kalgoorlie  eskay creek  david bell and round mountain operations and the purchase of an additional interest in the snip mine  partially offset by lower production following the completion of mining operations at the mclaughlin and nickel plate mines 
consolidated production costs per ounce per ounce of gold direct mining costs deferred stripping adjustments costs of third party smelters other cash operating costs royalties production taxes total cash costs depreciation and amortizaton reclamation total production costs homestake s consolidated total cash cost per equivalent ounce amounted to during compared to and during and  respectively 
the lower total cash costs per ounce primarily reflect higher production and a weaker australian dollar at the kalgoorlie operations  higher shipments and higher gold grades at the eskay creek mine and higher production at the round mountain mine  partially offset by lower grades at the williams and david bell mines 
the decrease in total cash costs per ounce during from primarily reflects higher silver grades at the eskay creek mine  higher production and the purchase of the disproportionate sharing arrangement at the kalgoorlie operations  higher production at the david bell mine  and an increase in ownership at the low cost snip mine  partially offset by lower production at the mclaughlin mine and the effects of a stronger australian dollar 
homestake s total noncash cost per equivalent ounce was during compared to and per ounce during and  respectively 
the decrease in noncash costs in primarily is due to reserve expansions at the eskay creek and snip mines 
the increase in noncash costs from reflects additional depreciation and amortization charges resulting from the purchases of the homestake gold of australia limited hgal minority interests  the disproportionate sharing arrangement and the additional interest in the snip mine 
reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce to financial statements thousands of dollars  except per ounce amounts production costs per financial statements    costs not included in homestake s production costs costs of third party smelters    production costs of equity accounted investments    sulfur and oil production costs    reclamation accruals    by product silver revenues    inventory movements and other    production costs for per ounce calculation purposes    ounces produced during the year    total cash costs per ounce eskay creek sells ore containing gold and silver directly to third party smelters 
for comparison purposes  cash operating costs per ounce include estimated third party costs incurred by smelters and others to produce marketable gold and silver 
includes  ounces produced at the ruby hill mine during  prior to commercial production  which are excluded from the calculation 
as a result of lower gold prices  at september and december  the company reviewed the carrying values of its gold mining operations using a per ounce gold price for its short lived operations and a per ounce gold price for its operations with longer lives 
the company determined that impairment write downs totaling million were required to reduce the carrying values of several of its assets or operations with short remaining lives  including the pinson mine in nevada  the homestake mine s open cut  and low grade stockpiled ore and certain redundant mining equipment at the kalgoorlie operations 
the company determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of its longer lived operations were required 
at the homestake mine in south dakota  production decreased slightly to  ounces during from  ounces during and  ounces during the decrease in production in primarily is a result of a decrease in the grade of ore from the underground operations partially offset by an increase in the grade of ore from the open cut 
the increase in production from is a result of an increase in production from the open cut  partially offset by lower production from the underground operations 
during  harder than normal ore from the open cut had reduced mill throughput 
total cash costs of per ounce during compare to total cash costs of per ounce during and per ounce during in january  the company announced the implementation of a major restructuring of operations at the homestake mine in order to reduce operating costs 
gold production will be reduced to approximately  to  ounces per year by the beginning of to implement the plan  the company suspended underground mining while it completed the final details of the new operating plan and readied the underground mine to begin operating on the restructured basis 
open cut ore stockpiles continued to be processed through the mill at an accelerated rate while the underground operations were suspended 
the new operating plan involves closing parts of the mine and concentrating on substantially fewer production levels 
the new operating plan  which has resulted in a million ounce reduction in reserves before considering production  should increase the mine s future total cash flow significantly 
underground crews commenced returning to work on a limited basis on march   and the remaining underground work force  which is expected to be about one half of the size of the pre shutdown work force  will return on a phased basis through april production at the mclaughlin mine in northern california decreased to  ounces during from  ounces during and  ounces during in june  mining operations were completed and the autoclaves were shut down as the ore body was depleted 
through  lower grade stockpiled ore will be processed through a conventional carbon in pulp circuit 
the effect of the decrease in production on unit operating costs largely has been offset by a reduction in expenditures 
total cash costs in were per ounce compared to per ounce in and per ounce in the company s share of production from the round mountain mine in nevada totaled  ounces in compared to production of  ounces in and  ounces in the higher production is a result of higher recoveries on the reusable pad and an increase in the volume of ore placed on the dedicated pad 
the increase in production from was due to higher grades and volumes of ore placed on the reusable pad and an increase in dedicated pad capacity 
total cash costs of per ounce in compare to total cash costs of per ounce and per ounce in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash costs in is due to the higher production 
during the third quarter of  a new round mountain mining plan was approved 
the new plan is expected to increase the mine s cash flow and profitability and reduce total cash costs 
primarily as result of the new plan  homestake s share of round mountain ore reserves decreased by approximately  ounces at december   before considering production 
a new  tons per day gravity mill to process higher grade sulfide ores commenced commercial production in november the mill  which is expected to produce approximately  ounces homestake s share of gold during  was constructed at a cost million homestake s share million 
development of the new ruby hill mine in nevada was completed in at a total capital cost of million 
the mine  which poured its first gold on november   produced  ounces of gold during the mine commenced commercial production effective january  and is budgeted to produce  ounces of gold in at a total cash cost of per ounce 
the eskay creek mine in british columbia  canada sold  tons of ore containing  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver during equivalent to approximately  ounces of gold  compared to  tons of ore sold in containing  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver equivalent to approximately  ounces of gold  and  tons of ore sold during containing  ounces of gold  and million ounces of silver equivalent to approximately  ounces of gold 
the increase in shipments reflects slightly higher shipments under the two long term smelter contracts and  tons of spot sales to an additional smelter 
the higher shipments in conjunction with higher gold grades and a decrease in the gold silver equivalency ratio were the primary reasons for the  ounce increase in production during the increase in shipments in from reflects  tons of spot ore sales to two additional smelters 
total cash costs  including third party smelter costs  decreased to per equivalent ounce during from per equivalent ounce during from per equivalent ounce during the lower costs per ounce primarily are a result of higher production  higher gold grades and productivity improvements  partially offset by lower silver grades 
the lower costs per ounce in comparison to primarily are a result of lower development costs  and higher gold and silver ore grades 
following a successful exploration program  homestake s share of eskay creek s proven and probable ore reserves increased by approximately  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver at december   before considering production 
the new gravity flotation mill facility at the eskay creek mine site  which was constructed at a cost of million  was commissioned in december the mill  which is expected to increase annual production by approximately  ounces of gold over the remaining mine life  will improve the profitability of certain eskay creek ore that would otherwise be shipped directly to third party smelters and upgrade other material that previously was not economic 
the company s share of gold production from the williams mine in the hemlo mining camp in canada amounted to  ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce during compared to  ounces at a total cash cost of per ounce during and  ounces produced at a total cash cost of per ounce during the slight decrease in production and corresponding increase in total cash costs during primarily is due to lower ore grades 
production at the williams mine is expected to remain at current levels for the next few years 
the company s share of production at the david bell mine  also in the hemlo mining camp  amounted to  ounces during compared to production of  ounces during and  ounces during the decrease in production during is due to lower ore grades partially offset by higher throughput 
during  mining in the higher grade areas of the mine offset production difficulties that had reduced throughput 
an accelerated development program was initiated to increase throughput by providing access to additional mining areas 
total cash costs were per ounce during compared to per ounce during and per ounce during production is expected to decline further in as the grade of ore to be mined approaches the remaining life of mine reserve grade 
homestake s share of production from the snip mine increased to  ounces during from  ounces during and  ounces during excluding the effects of the purchase of the additional interest in the mine in april  production decreased by during the lower production primarily is due to lower mill throughput caused by an increase in more labor intensive conventional mining as the remaining ore blocks become narrower as the mine nears the end of its economic life 
total cash costs increased to per ounce during from per ounce during and per ounce during production in is expected to be derived primarily from conventional mining areas 
as a result  total cash costs are expected to increase further and production is expected to be approximately  ounces 
hgal s share of production from the kalgoorlie operations in western australia increased to  ounces during from  ounces during and  ounces during the increase in hgal s share of production during reflects higher mill throughput  ore grades and recoveries 
the increase in hgal s share of production during from primarily was a result of an increase in mill throughput and the purchase of the disproportionate sharing arrangement from hgal s joint venture partner 
during  hgal paid  ounces to its joint venture partner under the disproportionate sharing arrangement 
in addition  the lower production reflects a temporary decline in production while the new fimiston mill additions were integrated with the existing complex  and lower production at the mt 
charlotte mine due to operational difficulties which hampered production early in the year 
total cash costs at the kalgoorlie operations decreased to per ounce during from per ounce in and per ounce in the decrease in cash costs in reflects the higher production  the installation of a recycle crusher at the fimiston mill earlier in the year  and a weakening of the australian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
the reduction in cash costs in from reflects higher production  partially offset by the effects of a stronger australian dollar 
the new agua de la falda mine owned by homestake  by codelco commenced mining operations late in and the first gold was poured in april the mine produced  ounces of gold during both the average ore grade and ore production rates have been higher than expected 
as a result  total cash costs of per ounce are well below earlier estimates 
the operation expects to produce between  and  ounces of gold in main pass the company has a undivided interest in the main pass sulfur mine and oil recovery operations in the gulf of mexico 
at december  the main pass sulfur mine had proven recoverable reserves of approximately million long tons basis of sulfur 
main pass oil production  which peaked in  is expected to continue to decline over the next few years 
during  continuing low sulfur prices  reduced sales volumes and higher operating costs for both sulfur and oil operations resulted in homestake recording a main pass operating loss of million compared to operating profits of million and million during and  respectively 
the sulfur operations incurred an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in and operating earnings of million in in response to the continued weak market for sulfur  main pass maintained the reduced production levels established in the company s share of sulfur revenues totaled million during compared to million during and million during during  the company sold  tons of sulfur at an average price of per ton compared to  tons of sulfur at an average price of per ton during and  tons at an average price of per ton during the company s share of production was  tons in compared to  tons in and  tons in planned write downs during the third quarter of by homestake s joint venture partners caused the company to reexamine the carrying value of its investment in main pass due to a prolonged period of low sulfur prices and homestake s current assessment of estimated future cash flows from the main pass sulfur mine  the company recorded a write down of million in its investment in main pass as a result of this write down  the company s carrying value of the main pass sulfur property  plant and equipment was reduced to zero at september  the company s share of oil revenues amounted to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
operating earnings from oil operations totaled million in compared to operating earnings of million in and million in the lower operating results reflect lower oil sales volumes and prices and higher production costs 
the improved results in comparison to primarily are due to higher oil prices and lower operating costs  partially offset by a decline in production 
other income a loss of million in compares to income of million in and million in the figure includes foreign currency losses of million and a gain of million from the sale of the george lake and back river joint venture interests in the northwest territories of canada 
other income in includes a million gain from the litigation recovery and million of foreign exchange losses  primarily on advances to hci  which are denominated in canadian dollars 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization of million during compares to million during and million during depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in reflects higher production offset by reserve expansions at the eskay creek and snip mines 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization in from primarily is due to higher production  and additional depreciation charges resulting from the purchases of the hgal minority interests  the disproportionate sharing arrangement and the additional interest in the snip mine 
administrative and general expense during  administrative and general expense increased to million from million and million during and  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects increased corporate development activity and the costs associated with employee relocations to the new agua de la falda and ruby hill mines 
exploration expense exploration expense  excluding capitalized costs associated with development stage projects  increased to million during from million in and million in the increase in exploration expense in primarily is due to increased activity as the company continues to pursue numerous prospective exploration targets and prospects 
during  advanced exploration continued in the northern part of south america at the el foco concession in venezuela  the st 
pierre concession in french guiana and the tapajos area in brazil 
exploration results were disappointing in venezuela and french guiana  and exploration efforts in this part of the world in will be directed to the largely under explored tapajos area 
exploration in the yilgarn area of western australia resulted in the discovery of poly metallic mineralization at the kundip project 
in addition  exploration activities were conducted at and around the kalgoorlie  eskay creek  homestake  snip  la falda  ruby hill and pinson operations 
the company currently plans to spend million on existing homestake exploration projects during income and mining taxes the company s income and mining tax rate was during compared to and during and  respectively 
the low effective tax rate is due to the geographic mix of pretax income and losses 
during  the company had pretax income of million in canada  and pretax losses of million  million and million in the united states  australia and other foreign jurisdictions  respectively 
the effective canadian tax rate was during  reflecting high statutory tax rates and certain nondeductible expenses 
in the united states  where the company is subject to the alternative minimum tax  the effective rate was in the effective australian tax rate was in reflecting the statutory rate of and certain nondeductible expenses 
no tax benefit was recognized on losses incurred in other foreign jurisdictions  primarily south america exploration expenditures  due to the uncertainty of their realization 
on a consolidated basis the tax benefits related to the losses incurred the united states and australia are largely offset by the tax expense recorded with respect to the canadian earnings  and the result is a consolidated tax benefit of only million 
income and mining tax expense in includes a million decrease in the consolidated tax provision due to a reduction in prior years income tax accruals for certain contingencies which were resolved in the tax expense also includes a million gain relating to the tax portion of a litigation recovery 
at december  and the company had tax valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
while circumstances could occur which would permit the company to reduce its deferred tax valuation allowances in future years  based on the company s current projections it does not expect significant future reductions 
events that would allow the company to reduce such allowances in the future would include i generating substantial taxable income in chile  ii an acceleration of the payment of the company s post retirement benefit obligations and iii the future disposal of certain non amortizable united states and australia land and mineral properties at such time as the company determines the properties have no further significant exploration potential 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of tax matters
