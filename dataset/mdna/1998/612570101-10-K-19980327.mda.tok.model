the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide its products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet pasta products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s distribution of pasta and pasta sauces to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  in december  and declined to approximately  as of december  during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote this expansion including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel 
in  the focus was changed to developing a profitable distribution base 
hence  the reduction in store totals and the return to profitability 
during the company expects to add profitable retail and club distribution

the company sold its restaurant subsidiary to an affiliate of mr 
lance mortensen  a former chairman and chief executive officer and director of the company 
the success of the company depends on a number of factors including whether the company can continue to add new products  whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their stores offering the company s products  and whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for the consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
continuing operations for  and net revenues from continuing operations were   and  for  and  respectively  reflecting an annual increase in sales of for  when compared to  and a decline for when compared to the increase in was the result of increased distribution on a per store basis to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of  compared to approximately  in  and  for the decline in sales in reflected the elimination of unprofitable chains and direct store delivery accounts 
margins declined from in to in due to an emphasis on increasing distribution  albeit at significantly lower margins 
the gross margin increase from in to in was due mainly to reduced sales discounts and allowances through better controls and elimination of unprofitable accounts

the increases were also attributable to expansion of the company s infrastructure  including increased administrative and management salaries  recruiting and training  and facilities costs 
additionally  selling costs were high as a result of the company s efforts to obtain new customers and enter new geographic markets

the total losses from discontinued operations also included  in losses from disposition and  in losses during the phaseout period covering provisions relating to losses prior to sale of ufo  accruals related to discontinued operations  and provisions to reduce the net assets from discontinued operations to their net realizable value 
the losses were charged directly to the resulting reserves  as were other expenditures related to the restaurant and franchising operations 
during  the reserves were also reduced by  to reflect adjustments of estimates to the actual company expenditures 
remaining reserves of  at the end of were utilized during  including a  recovery

while there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the company s initiatives  management believes these changes in its business  as discussed above  will allow the company to enhance its financial position and operating results 
management believes that the company s credit facility and cash generated from continuing operations will provide adequate funding to meet its needs through sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy targets sustainable growth 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business  increasing its distribution through the rapidly growing number of natural and organic food retailers  and the introduction of innovative new products designed to meet consumer needs 
expansion of the company s club store business continued in with the addition of national distribution of its products through sam s club stores a division of wal mart and cub foods of colorado

the company estimates there are potential natural and organic retail grocery stores available for its products 
the company is introducing new southwest mexican products to help fulfill its objective of providing added meal occasions to the consumer  and to take advantage of the fast growing market for southwestern and mexican food products 
initial offerings in the new line include blue corn ravioli with sonoma jack habanero cheese filling  chili cilantro ravioli with southwestern chicken filling  and a new ranchero salsa 
the company s new product offering will also include the introduction of items into the growing home meal replacement hmr category 
the company will introduce its first three products in the hmr line in early cost reductions the company significantly reduced its total corporate and plant administrative headcount and costs on a going forward basis as part of the plan adopted in the fourth quarter of to return to profitable operations and optimize the financial performance 
in january   the company relocated its corporate headquarters from san francisco  california to its manufacturing facility in salinas  california 
this move resulted in a substantial reduction of future corporate and overhead costs  beginning in the second quarter of in addition  the company significantly reduced the scope of its advertising and media campaigns 
the company will continue with those promotional activities  such as in store demonstrations  that it considers effective and consistent with its ongoing sales objectives 
in this light  the company s slotting fees from club stores and grocery chains for shelf space allocations  for example  declined significantly starting in the fourth quarter of total selling  general and administrative expenses declined million compared to in an effort to continue to reduce the cost of production  the company invested million in machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements in retooling its salinas production facilities over the last two years to increase operating efficiencies as well as the shelf life of its products 
major customers two of the company s retail customers  costco and sam s  accounted for and respectively of the company s sales for the twelve months ended december  no other customer accounted for greater than of net revenues for the period 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include recent operating losses no assurance of continued profitability 
the company s profitability began to decline in in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
the company reported additional operating losses from continuing operations in nine of fourteen quarters since then 
the company s net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended december was  a third straight profitable quarter 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its profitability in the long term 
liquidity  need for additional capital 
management believes that it will have sufficient resources to provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements through thereafter  the company s operations will need to be funded either with funds generated through operations or with additional debt or equity financing 
if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
deferred tax assets 
since the company could not determine that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  a valuation allowance was provided in   and key personnel  management transition 
the success of the company depends on the efforts of key management personnel 
on august   the interim chief executive officer was replaced by a permanent chief executive officer  r 
lance hewitt 
on september  the company appointed a new chief financial officer  stephen l 
brinkman 
neither officer has previously been a part of the company s management team 
the company s success will depend on its ability to operate under new management  to effect a smooth transition to new management with minimal disruption in operations  and to motivate and retain key employees and officers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete a smooth transition from its prior management team to the current management team  that new officers will be able to perform effectively  or that significant management turnover will not continue in the future 
at march  there are no keyman insurance policies in place 
impact of inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations to date 
substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  energy  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the company s common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation and declines in the price of its stock may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has a modern production facility  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its production plant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
dependence on major customers 
in three customers accounted for   and respectively of the company s total net revenues 
loss of any of these customers  costco  sam s club stores  and safeway  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers 
the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors which have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect its market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in the company s distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on its business 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures 
effectiveness of registration statement 
the sec declared the company s registration statement on form s effective as of october  as a result  holders of an aggregate of up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock were eligible to sell their shares in the public market 
subsequently  a number of such shares have been sold  and the company repurchased  shares from a selling stockholder 
substantial sales by stockholders  who continue to hold registered shares could have a negative effect on the price of the company s common stock 
year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year the company is assessing the internal readiness of its computer systems for handling the year the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issues  and does not believe the cost of such actions will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of such changes  and the company s inability to implement such changes could have an adverse impact on the future results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards during  the financial accounting standards board released its statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the entity s financial statements 
the objective of sfas is to report a measure of all changes in the equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
sfas does not address issues of recognition or measurement for comprehensive income and its components  and therefore  it will not have an impact on the financial condition or results of the company upon operation 
the financial accounting standards board also recently released sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this statement  which is also effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires reporting of financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company operates in only one business segment  production and distribution of pasta and related products  and thus believes this new statement will have no impact on disclosure  financial conditions  or results of operations
