item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   sales increased to  from the  reported in fiscal net income in fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
both the roofing products and industrial products groups generated significant increases in sales 
the roofing products group reported better operating results in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  the substantial increase in net income was primarily attributable to increased demand and dramatically improved operating results in each of the industrial products group s principal operations of conductive coatings used in digital cellular phones and in other electronic equipment  remanufactured diesel engine components used in the transportation industry  and technology licensing and consulting services for the natural gas processing industry 
in fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
accordingly  fiscal amounts have been restated to reflect the accounting change 
had the company not made this change  net income would have been lower by  in fiscal sales for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the western united states produced very strong demand for elk prestique premium laminated shingles 
however  shipments on the west coast were limited during much of the second half of fiscal by el nino s impact  as many roofing contractors could not replace leaking roofs during extended periods of heavy rainfall 
demand was also higher in the southeast  midwest and north regions 
only in the southwestern region was demand lower than in the previous fiscal year 
average selling prices were about the same in fiscal compared to fiscal elk s roofing mat operations achieved significantly higher sales and operating profit  primarily as a result of growing demand for its high quality roofing mats and specialty industrial products 
operating income for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of elk s three roofing plants and its roofing mat operation were very profitable in fiscal  although the ennis  texas roofing plant s operating results were lower in fiscal as a result of lower demand in the southwestern region 
the impact of high winds and heavy rainfall in much of the nation this past winter has increased the level of demand during the latter months of fiscal and early fiscal the company currently anticipates sharply higher demand for its premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles and mat products in fiscal sales for the industrial products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income for this group increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal each of the three principal operations in this business segment reported significantly higher sales and operating income in fiscal chromium corporation continued to benefit from strong demand for its compushield r conductive coatings and dispense conductive gasketing used in digital cellular phones and in other electronic equipment 
chromium also experienced higher sales and significantly improved margins in plating certain proprietary finishes for large diesel engine components during fiscal further  ortloff engineers revenues from its technology licensing and consulting services for the natural gas processing industry about doubled in fiscal as compared to fiscal this resulted in a tripling of operating income for this business activity in fiscal however  management expects that ortloff engineers sales and operating profit will decline in fiscal as a result of lower oil prices  which may cause some potential customers to defer planned projects until economic conditions are more favorable 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily as a result of increased business activity 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs declined to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal   of interest was capitalized in connection with the company s major facilities expansion program 
in fiscal  the company capitalized  in interest costs in connection with its existing plant expansion program 
fiscal compared to fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   sales grew to  a increase over fiscal sales of  both the roofing products and industrial products groups contributed to the increase in sales 
net income in fiscal increased to  from the  achieved in fiscal higher net income was primarily attributable to the industrial products group  which achieved substantially improved operating results in fiscal in addition  in fiscal the company incurred  in pretax charges in connection with a provision for the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the reduction in value of certain other assets during that fiscal year 
fiscal and amounts have been restated to reflect the accounting change for inventories adopted in fiscal sales for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the roofing products group accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal and in fiscal higher sales were primarily due to an increase in shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles 
sales from the new plant in shafter  california accounted for a significant part of the increased shipments 
average selling prices were about the same in fiscal compared to fiscal operating profit for the roofing products group decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the shafter  california plant achieved profitable operations in fiscal after incurring a significant operating loss in the prior fiscal year 
although both of the other roofing plants were very profitable  operating income at these facilities was lower in fiscal  primarily as a result of higher freight rates  higher raw materials costs and costs of implementing a fourth shift operation at the tuscaloosa  alabama roofing plant to increase that facility s production capacity 
the company s new nonwoven fiberglass roofing mat plant at its ennis  texas facility achieved its performance test level of operations effective april  although overall mat plant operations were profitable in fiscal  operating income from mat plant operations was significantly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher costs associated with the new plant in its start up year of operations 
sales for the industrial products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income for this business segment increased to  in fiscal compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal chromium corporation achieved significantly higher revenues and operating results relating to conductive coatings of plastic enclosures for electronic equipment 
improved operating conditions in this area more than offset decreased demand for chromium s hard chrome plated diesel engine cylinder liners for the railroad  marine and stationary power industries 
in addition  in fiscal  chromium recorded  in charges relating to a reduction in value of assets at its cleveland  ohio plant upon the adoption of sfas no 
ortloff engineers achieved much higher revenues in fiscal from licensing the company s process technology for construction of both new natural gas processing plants and retrofits to upgrade existing gas processing plants 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were for fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal  the company established a larger sales organization to better serve growing market areas 
during fiscal  this larger organization was able to service the increase in sales orders without a proportionate increase in overall selling costs 
interest expense was higher in fiscal as a result of the company s completion of its three year major facilities expansion program which was completed in march subsequent to that date  all interest was expensed as incurred 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash flows from operating activities of  in fiscal  despite a  increase in working capital 
the increase in working capital was primarily the result of higher trade receivables  which increased  during fiscal receivables increased primarily as a result of higher sales in fiscal  together with a higher level of deferred payment term receivables 
at june   deferred payment term receivables from promotional programs to certain customers were  compared to  at june  deferred receivables outstanding at june   are primarily due during the first four months of fiscal the increase in receivables was partially offset by lower inventories and prepaid expenses 
the current ratio at june  was to compared to to at june  historically  working capital requirements and associated borrowings fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and borrowings are higher in the spring and summer  and lower in the fall and winter 
the company used  for investing activities in fiscal the majority of investing expenditures were for additions to property  plant and equipment 
most capital expenditures in fiscal were for productivity  capacity  and cost improvement projects at the current roofing plants and for the development of new computer systems 
in addition  the company expanded its capacity in the chromium corporation conductive coatings operation to meet rapidly growing demand for its compushield process 
capital expenditures are expected to be about  in fiscal the majority of currently planned fiscal capital expenditures are a continuation of productivity  capacity and cost improvement projects at its existing roofing plants  continued capacity expansion of the conductive coatings operation  and capital costs associated with developing new computer systems 
the company expects to invest about million over the next three years to expand capacity and improve productivity at existing plants and to build new plants in both the roofing products and industrial products segments 
cash flows used for financing activities were  in fiscal  primarily resulting from dividend payments  a  decrease in long term debt  and purchases of treasury shares 
long term debt represented of the  of invested capital long term debt plus shareholders equity at june  in december  the company increased its unsecured revolving line of credit to  and extended the term to december  as of june    was available under this facility 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to  of the company s common shares on the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
as of june    shares with cumulative cost of  had been repurchased 
in september  the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to six cents per common share after giving effect to a stock split and declared a three for two stock split payable in the form of a stock dividend distributed on november  to shareholders of record on october  management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and its unsecured revolving credit facility should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund its planned capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements 
however  management believes it could secure additional capital at favorable rates  if needed  to support its capital expansion program 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards of reporting of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal  but does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires public companies to disclose  among other things  certain interim and annual financial information about the enterprise using a new management approach 
this approach requires segment information to be reported based on how management evaluates the operating performance of its business units or segments 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in fiscal and does not currently anticipate significant changes in its reportable segments 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  requiring  among other things  companies to expense on a current basis previously capitalized start up costs 
at june   the company had  of unamortized capitalized start up costs 
this statement of position is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   unless adopted earlier 
the company plans to adopt this new accounting standard in fiscal at which time all remaining unamortized capitalized start up costs will be expensed and reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
year issue the company is currently developing a new information system for its critical financial  distribution and manufacturing applications 
the system is scheduled for completion and full implementation in the summer of at an estimated total cost of about million 
while the primary purpose of this new information system is to modernize and improve the company s operations  it is also expected to resolve the year issues in these critical computer systems 
costs to develop this new information system are being capitalized in accordance with sop costs to implement the new information system and other costs relating to year readiness are being expensed as incurred 
as of june   the company s expenditures for its new information system have been million and its expenditures for year readiness projects have been less than  at this time  other than the cost of developing and implementing its new information system  the company does not believe that the costs of addressing the year issue will be material 
the company does not believe that other critical information systems work has been deferred due to its year efforts 
the company also has teams of employees and consultants who are reviewing other computer applications and systems not included in the scope of the new information system  including systems other than information systems that have embedded technology  and its interaction with its suppliers  customers and other business partners for year readiness 
the company is close to completing the process of taking relevant inventory  assessing risk  assigning priorities to various tasks and performing limited internal tests 
the company has completed its initial remedial programming for its mainframe computer system and is ready to begin testing this system 
the company has developed contingency plans for its critical information system which primarily consist of making its existing information system year compliant in the event the new system is not completed by its scheduled date 
contingency plans for other aspects of year readiness are currently being developed 
the company expects to have fully developed action and contingency plans by the end of calendar  and to have completed integrated testing and any remediation before january  the company believes the year readiness project is on schedule for timely completion 
based on a current assessment of risks relating to its year readiness  the company does not believe that this issue will result in uncertainty that is reasonably likely to materially affect future financial results or operating performance 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the company s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements about its prospects for the future 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following the company s roofing products business is cyclical and is affected by weather and some of the same economic factors that affect the housing and home improvement industries generally  including interest rates  the availability of financing and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the company s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
further  changes in building codes and other standards from time to time can cause changes in demand  or increases in costs that may not be passed through to customers 
in the asphalt roofing products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher trucking and rail costs 
historically  the company has been able to pass some of the higher raw material and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the company be unable to recover higher raw material and transportation costs from price increases of its products  operating results could be lower than projected 
during fiscal  the company completed the construction of a plant at the company s ennis  texas facility to manufacture nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats and other mats for a variety of industrial uses 
the company also expects to make up to million in new investments to expand capacity and improve productivity at existing plants and to build new plants over the next three years 
progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict for new plant facilities 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  if substantial cost overruns occur in building new plants  or if demand for products produced at new plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the company s industrial products subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the company s litigation  including its patent infringement suits against gaf building materials corporation and certain affiliates  is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
even with fully developed action and contingency plans for year readiness  it is possible that the company will not achieve full internal readiness 
further  the company s business may be adversely affected by external year disruption that the company is not in position to control  including but not limited to potential disruptions in power and other energy supplies  telecommunications or other infrastructure  potential disruptions in transportation and the supply of raw materials  and potential disruptions in financial and banking systems 
year problems therefore could result in unanticipated expenses or liabilities  production or disruption delays or other adverse effects on the company 
although the company currently anticipates that most of its needs for new capital in the near future will be met with internally generated funds  significant increases in interest rates could substantially affect its borrowing costs under its existing loan facility  or its cost of alternative sources of capital 
each of the company s businesses  especially its conductive coatings division s business  is subject to the risks of technological changes that could affect the demand for or the relative cost of the company s products and services  or the method and profitability of the method of distribution or delivery of such products and services 
in addition  the company s businesses each could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income if it lost one or more of its largest customers 
although the company insures itself against physical loss to its manufacturing facilities  including business interruption losses  natural or other disasters and accidents  including but not limited to fire  earthquake  damaging winds and explosions  operating results could be adversely affected if any of its manufacturing facilities became inoperable for an extended period of time due to such events 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions
