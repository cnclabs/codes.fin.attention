item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of precision molded thermoplastic and metal fabricated enclosures supplied worldwide to telecommunications network operators 
the company believes it currently supplies a substantial portion of the enclosure product requirements of a number of major catv and telephone company operators 
the company was incorporated on april  as the successor to the predecessor  which has been merged into the company in connection with the initial public offering 
all financial data contained herein with respect to the company include the financial data of the predecessor 
since  the company was an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
during  due to the company s initial public offering  the company changed in form from an s corporation to a c corporation 
as an s corporation  the company s income  whether or not distributed  was taxed at the stockholder level for federal income tax purposes 
for california franchise tax purposes  s corporations were taxed at of taxable income in and of taxable income in  and the first six months of during  the top federal tax rate for c corporations was and the corporate tax rate in california was 
as a result  the change in form affected the earnings and the cash flows of the company by increasing the level of federal and state income tax 
the pro forma provision for income taxes in the accompanying statements of income reflects the income tax provision of the company as recorded in its income statement plus the additional tax on s corporation income at c corporation rates 
prior to the initial public offering  the company had obtained the exclusive rights to certain patents owned by mr 
channell  sr 
and paid him license fees based on the sale of the patented products 
in connection with the initial public offering  the company purchased the channell patents and  accordingly  the license fee arrangement between the company and mr 
channell  sr 
with respect to such patents was terminated and  thereafter  no license fees were paid to mr 
channell  sr 
or any other party with respect to the channell patents 
in addition  any patents obtained in the future with respect to new technology developed by mr 
channell  sr 
will be owned by the company 
prior to the termination  a license fee on the sale of certain products utilizing the channell patents was payable to mr 
channell  sr 
see item during   and the first quarter of  the license fees payable to mr 
channell  sr 
were million  million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with the consummation of the initial public offering  no license fees were incurred with respect to product sales subsequent to the first quarter of in connection with the initial public offering  the annual base salary of mr 
channell  sr 
was increased from  to  and the annual base salary of william h 
channell  jr  the company s president  was increased from  to  which amounts do not include any bonuses that may be payable to such executive officers 
upon consummation of the initial public offering  mr 
channell  jr 
received options to acquire  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price per share  which options will become exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of issuance 
the company s core business consists of enclosure product sales to the catv market  which comprised approximately of the company s total net sales during  in  and during  with two customers  media one and time warner  accounting for and  respectively  of the company s total net sales during the company believes that many of its customers periodically review their supply relationships  and the company can experience significant changes in buying patterns from specific customers between fiscal periods 
the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog  and sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  results in the company s operating results being at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
the company uses numerous raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although management believes that the company has adequate sources of supply for such raw materials  increases in the market prices of the company s raw materials could significantly increase the company s cost of goods sold and materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s profitability may also be materially adversely affected by decreases in its sales volume because many of the costs associated with the company s rent  product development  engineering  tooling and other manufacturing processes are fixed in nature and must be spread over its sales base in order to maintain historic levels of profitability 
in addition to company manufactured products  the company markets complementary products manufactured by third parties 
with respect to sales of cable in conduit products  the company generally receives a commission upon the sale of such products 
pursuant to the agreements under which the company markets such products  during the terms thereof and for a period of two years thereafter  each of the company and the manufacturer of such products is prohibited from competing with the other in any product line that is  or within the year prior to termination has been  represented  manufactured or sold by the other within the specified markets covered by the agreements 
during the periods discussed under results of operations below  the company s sales increases resulted primarily from additional sales to the company s existing customers as they expanded  rebuilt and upgraded their signal delivery networks in order to deliver enhanced communications services  as well as additional sales to new customers  particularly telephone companies that have recently entered the catv market  international customers  and through the rms and standby electronics acquisitions 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s operating results for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit commission income selling general and administrative license fees research and development income from operations interest income expense  net income before income taxes pro forma income taxes pro forma net income adjusted income from operations pro forma income taxes and pro forma net income have been determined giving effect to the termination of the company s s corporation status in july actual income tax expense has been reflected for the last six months of and for all of see note to selected financial data 
adjusted income from operations has been determined giving effect to the transactions described in notes and to selected financial data 
adjusted financial data is not applicable for new accounting pronouncements in  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas  which superseded apb opinion no 
income per share for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas sfas requires companies to present basic income per share  and  if applicable diluted income per share  instead of primary and fully diluted income per share 
basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to issue common stock were exercised into common stock 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  which prescribes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income consists of net income or loss for the current period and other comprehensive income income  expenses  gains and losses that currently bypass the income statement and are reported directly in a separate component of equity 
sfas requires that components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which applies only to publicly held business entities 
a reportable segment  referred to as an operating segment  is a component of an entity about which separate financial information is produced internally  that is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  management has not determined whether adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million or from million in to million in catv net sales increased million or from million in to million in as a result of the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices by rms  million of channell proprietary products due to moderate growth from system upgrade and new network construction projects worldwide  and million of standby electronics metal enclosures 
telecommunications net sales increased million or from million in to million in  as a result of increased activity in sealed plant products 
the company has historically provided a breakdown of sales to the catv and telephone industries based on product sales  ie  each product has been traditionally purchased by one or the other industry 
with the gradual convergence of the two industries  an industry breakdown based on product sales becomes less valid each year as telephone companies purchase equipment heretofore purchased only by catv companies and vice versa 
management believes continuation of an industry sales breakdown based on product sales would be misleading and has decided that all future reports and publications will combine these two market segments under the title telecommunications 
domestic net sales increased million or from million in to million in this increase was a result of the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices and million of channell proprietary products due to moderate system upgrade and new network construction growth 
international net sales increased million or from million in to million in  primarily due to the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices and million of metal enclosures 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in million of this improvement is attributable to the sales of rf passive devices  million was attributable to increased volume of channell proprietary products  and million was attributable to the sales of metal enclosures 
gross margin decreased from in to in primarily due to a and margin contribution from the sales of rf passive devices and metal enclosures  respectively 
gross margin on channell s proprietary products decreased from to during the comparable periods primarily due to increased depreciation expense from capital expenditures in the comparative periods and increased manufacturing staffing 
commission income 
commission income decreased million or from million in to million in  due to a decrease in sales of cable in conduit products as a result of aggressive pricing by competition and lower sales in the eastern part of the united states due to severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of selling 
selling expense increased million or from million in to million in  primarily as a result of million of increased sales and marketing expenses related to the rms and standby electronics subsidiaries  and million for increased payroll and related expenses in connection with expanded staffing to support increased sales and marketing activities worldwide 
the increased selling expenses discussed above were offset by the salary and expenses of an officer now being classified as general and administrative expenses due to expanded responsibility 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense decreased from in to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in to million in such increase occurred primarily as a result of increased payroll and employee benefits in the amount of million due to increased staffing in the administrative and information systems departments as a result of the rms and standby electronics acquisitions  as well as the reclassification of the salary of an executive officer 
travel  legal  auditing and professional services increased million as a result of being a publicly traded company for a full year in as compared to having such status for six months in depreciation  insurance and facilities expense increased million as a result of the rms acquisition

as a result of the items discussed above  income from operations was million in both and  but declined as a percentage of net sales from in to in income taxes 
income taxes increased million from million in to million in the increase is principally due to the termination of the s corporation status as a result of the initial public offering  at which time the company recorded deferred tax assets on its balance sheet with a corresponding credit to its income tax expense 
since the initial public offering  the company pays federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
comparison of the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million or from million in to million in catv net sales increased million or from million in to million in as a result of new account development during the period and a continued moderate growth from rebuild and new network construction projects 
telecommunications net sales increased million or from million in to million in this sales increase was due to the introduction of new sealed products during the period and an increased activity in conventional copper based telephone products 
domestic net sales increased million or from million in to million in this increase is a result of the items discussed above  in the catv and telecommunications sections 
international net sales decreased million or from million in to million in  mainly due to a slowdown in broadband network construction by certain pacific rim and european customers 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in gross margin increased from in to in the improvement in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to an increase in the sales mix of products with a higher margin as well as an overall increase in sales volume  which resulted in higher operating leverage ie  a higher percentage of sales relative to fixed costs 
commission income 
commission income decreased million or from million in to million in  due to lower sales volume of cable in conduit products

income from operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  income from operations increased million or from million in to million in and operating margin increased from to 
income taxes 
income taxes increased million from million in to million in due to the termination of the s corporation status at the time of the initial public offering 
after the initial public offering  the company pays federal and state income taxes as a regular corporation  offset by the recording of deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources upon the termination of the s corporation status and prior to the initial public offering in july  the company declared a dividend to its then existing stockholders representing all of the company s s corporation accumulated adjustment account remaining at the time 
the s corporation distribution totalled million and was paid out of the net proceeds of the initial public offering 
prior to the initial public offering  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer owned six patents utilized by the company in its business the channell patents  and was entitled to receive license fees based upon the sale of certain products embodying the channell patents 
prior to the initial public offering  the channell patents were sold to the company for the aggregate consideration of million  which was initially funded through borrowings under the company s bank line and then repaid from the net proceeds of the initial public offering 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  the company used million from the net proceeds to repay the company s bank indebtedness 
upon the closing of the initial public offering in july and the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment in august  the company received net proceeds from the issuance of stock of million 
as of december   the company has invested million  which includes the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering  in marketable securities and cash equivalents 
interest income earned on these securities for the year ended december  was million and million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and net cash used in financing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the purchase of and million including million of maturities in short term securities was included in investing activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of higher sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in inventories increased from million for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of increased work in process and finished goods inventories required for the increased sales volume forecasted and the acquisitions of rms and standby electronics 
the company made capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively  and anticipates increased capital spending for machinery  product tooling  test equipment and computer hardware and software as it continues to implement its new product development plans 
the company s material commitment consists of a capital lease for certain computer equipment in connection with the company s new management information system 
such lease will require aggregate payments of approximately million through december the company also leases its manufacturing and warehouse facility in temecula  california consisting of two buildings totalling approximately  square feet which require annual lease payments of approximately million 
the company is heavily dependent upon complex computer systems for all phases of its operations  which include production  sales and distribution 
the company s computer software programs recognize only the last two digits of the year in any date eg  for  and therefore some software may inaccurately process data in or if the software is not reprogrammed  upgraded or replaced the year issue 
the company has initiated a program intended to timely mitigate and or prevent on a timely basis the adverse effects of the year issue  and to pursue compliance by suppliers 
the company believes that many of its suppliers and customers may also have year issues which could affect the company 
at this time  it is not possible to quantify the overall cost of this work  nor the financial effect of the year issue if it is not resolved on a timely basis 
however  the company presently believes that the cost of fixing the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and result of operations 
the company currently maintains a revolving credit facility as amended to date  the revolving credit facility with the bank of america national trust and savings association bank of america  consisting of i a million working capital revolving line of credit  which had no outstanding balance at december   and ii a million equipment revolving line of credit and a standby letter of credit facility  which had no outstanding balance at december  loans under the working capital line bear interest at the bank of america s reference rate and mature on may   while loans under the equipment line bear interest at the bank of america s reference rate  plus and are repayable in sixty equal monthly installments of principal and interest commencing in the first month after issuance of each advance 
availability of advances under the revolving credit facility expires on may  the equipment line of credit is collateralized by the related equipment financed by the bank of america 
the revolving credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants which  among other things  impose limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  merge or consolidate  sell its assets  make certain investments or  under certain circumstances  pay dividends 
the company is also required to comply with covenants related to tangible net worth and other financial ratios 
the company believes that  in order to carry on its current operations  income from operations  the remaining proceeds from the initial public offering and the revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures and working capital requirements through forward looking statements this report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are being provided pursuant to that legislation 
in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
the following is not intended as  and should not be considered  an exhaustive list of relevant factors 
obsolescence  uncertainty of market acceptance of new products the communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  satellite  wireless and other communication technologies currently being deployed may represent a threat to copper  coaxial and fiber optic based systems by reducing the need for wire line networks 
to date  however  the company believes that these technologies have not had a significant impact on the demand for traditional wire line network based services  and management anticipates that a number of factors  including network capacity requirements  existing investments in wire line networks  security and long term cost effectiveness  will result in continued growth of wire line networks 
however  there can be no assurance that future advances or further development of these or other new technologies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
further  the company s growth strategies are designed  in part  to take advantage of opportunities that the company believes are emerging as a result of the development of enhanced voice  video and other transmission networks and internet access in the telecommunications industry 
there can be no assurance that demand resulting from these emerging trends will develop rapidly or that the company s products will meet with market acceptance 
importance of new product development to growth the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of market trends  development and implementation of new designs and processes and a substantial capital commitment 
the trend toward consolidation of the communications industry may require the company to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements 
although the company s manufacturing and marketing expertise has enabled it to successfully develop and market new products in the past  any failure by the company to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of customers  limited backlog the company s core business consists of enclosure product sales to the catv market 
such sales comprised approximately of the company s total net sales during in  and during the catv industry is concentrated  with relatively few cable operators accounting for a large percentage of the company s available market 
consequently  while the company shipped product to over  customer locations in  its five largest customers by sales volume accounted for of the company s total net sales in two customers  media one and time warner  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total net sales during the period 
the company s customers typically require prompt shipment of the company s products 
as a result  the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog  and sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage see operating leverage below and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  results in the company s operating results being at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on the communications industry the company s sales to the telecommunications industry represent substantially all of the company s historical sales and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
within that industry  approximately of the company s total net sales in were derived from domestic and international sales to the catv segment  with of total net sales for the year attributable to two customers in that industry  media one and time warner 
the company expects that sales to the catv industry will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales 
demand for products to this segment depends primarily on capital spending by cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
the amount of capital spending and  therefore  the company s sales and profitability are affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  access by cable operators to financing  government regulation of cable operators  demand for cable services and technological developments in the broadband communications industry 
the company s remaining sales in were derived from the telecommunications industry  primarily local telephone operators 
although local telephone operators may have greater access to capital than many cable operators  the same factors dictating the demand for products in the catv segment of the industry also apply to the local telephone segment 
thus  the company s success is dependent upon continued demand for products used in signal transmission systems from the communications industry generally  including both catv and telephone  which may be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the convergence of voice  data and video transmission systems occurring within the catv and telephone markets  continuing consolidation of companies within those markets and the provision of internet access by cable operators and local telephone companies 
price fluctuations of raw materials  availability of complementary products the company s cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of the raw materials used in the company s manufacturing processes  including resin 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions for such materials  although it periodically enters into contracts for certain raw materials for as much as one year or more 
there can be no assurance that price increases in raw materials can be passed on to the company s customers through increases in product prices 
in addition  in order to position itself as a full line product supplier  the company relies on certain manufacturers to supply products that complement the company s own product line  including grade level boxes and cable in conduit 
although the company believes there are multiple sources of supply for these products  disruptions or delays in the supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s own products 
acquisitions and failure to integrate acquired businesses one of the company s principal strategies is to increase its revenues and the markets it serves through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and acquire attractive acquisition candidates  profitably manage such acquired businesses or successfully integrate such acquired businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to  adverse short term effects on the company s reported financial condition or results of operations  diversion of management s attention  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results or operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that businesses acquired in the future will be profitable at the time of acquisition or that the businesses recently acquired or acquired in the future will achieve sales and profitability justifying the company s investment therein or that the company will recognize the synergies expected from such acquisitions 
the failure to obtain any or all of the desired results from these acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
impact of operating leverage in the event of sales decline because of the relatively high percentage of fixed costs for rent  product development  engineering  tooling and related fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of total costs  the company s ability to maintain its historic profitability is dependent on generating a sufficient volume of product sales  thereby spreading fixed costs over the sales base 
due to this operating leverage  a reduction in sales or the rate of sales growth could have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s financial results 
seasonality and fluctuations in operating results the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the first and fourth quarters generally reflecting lower sales due to the impact of adverse weather conditions on construction projects that may alter or postpone the needs of customers for delivery of the company s products 
the company s operating results may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to several other factors  including the volume and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers  the timing of new product announcements and the availability of products by the company or its competitors  the overall level of capital expenditures by catv operators and local telephone companies  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  variations in the mix of products the company sells  and the availability and cost of raw materials 
risks associated with international operations international sales accounted for  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively  and the company expects that international sales may increase as a percentage of sales in the future 
due to its international sales  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar which could materially adversely affect us dollar revenues or operating expenses  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  potentially longer collection cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws and communications standards 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with its international operations 
there can be no assurance that these risks of conducting business internationally will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
competition the industries in which the company operates are highly competitive 
further  in connection with the anticipated growth in the communications industry generally and demand for products required in signal transmission networks in particular  the level and intensity of competition may increase in the future 
in the telephone segment of the industry  the company s competition includes a company that has a significant market share 
while the company s net sales to this segment have increased from million in to million in  and the company s strategy  which includes continued focus on increasing sales to this segment  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against that company or other competitors  many of which may have access to greater financial resources than the company 
disruptions at the company s manufacturing facility  lease with related party all of the company s manufacturing operations are currently located at the company s facility in temecula  california  which also includes the company s principal warehouse and corporate offices 
the company s success depends in large part on the orderly operation of this facility 
because the company s manufacturing operations and administrative departments are concentrated at this facility  a fire  earthquake or other disaster at this facility could materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company maintains standard property and earthquake insurance on this facility as well as business interruption insurance and back up data systems 
the company currently leases the temecula facility from william h 
channell  sr  a principal stockholder and chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
the company believes the terms of these leases are no less favorable than would be available from an unrelated third party after arm s length negotiations 
although the company has renewal options through the year under these leases  there can be no assurance that the company and mr 
channell  sr 
will be able to agree on renewal options for the properties currently leased by the company 
the failure of the company to renew the leases would require the company to relocate its existing facilities which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executive  engineering  marketing and sales personnel 
key personnel of the company include william h 
channell  sr  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  william h 
channell  jr  the president and chief operating officer  and the other executive officers of the company 
competition for qualified personnel in the communications industry is intense  and the loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company has entered into employment contracts with mr 
channell  sr 
and mr 
channell  jr 
changing regulatory environment the communications industry is subject to regulation in the united states and other countries 
federal and state regulatory agencies regulate most of the company s domestic customers 
on february   the united states congress passed the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  which the president signed into law on february  the telecommunications act lifts certain restrictions on the liability of companies  including rbocs and other customers of the company  to compete with one another and liberally reduces the regulation of the communications industry 
while the company believes that the deregulation of the communications industry may increase the company s opportunities to provide solutions for its customers signal transmission network needs  the effect of the telecommunications act on the market for the company s products is difficult to predict at this time  and there can be no assurance that competition in the company s markets will not intensify as a result of such deregulation 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could materially adversely affect the company s business 
uncertain ability to manage growth  risks associated with implementation of new management information system the growth in the company s business has required  and is expected to continue to require  significant company resources in terms of personnel  management and other infrastructure 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into its overall operations and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
in  the company intends to complete the implementation of a new management information system mis 
the company believes the new mis will significantly affect many aspects of its business  including its accounting  operations  purchasing  sales and marketing functions 
the successful implementation of this system will be important to the company s provision of services and to facilitate future growth 
if the company is not successful in implementing its mis or if the company experiences difficulties in such implementation  the company could experience problems with delivery of its products or an adverse impact on its ability to access financial and accounting information on a timely basis 
environmental matters the company is subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and uses a limited number of chemicals that are classified as hazardous or similar substances 
although management believes that the company s operations are in compliance in all material respects with current environmental laws and regulations  the company s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company
