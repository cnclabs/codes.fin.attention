item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in one industry segment  enhanced communications services 
the company s services include based services for mobile individuals  voice messaging  full service conference calling and  in  enhanced document distribution services xpedite and internet based communications 
the company s principal competitive advantage is that it integrates these services through its intelligent network and provides its customers a single source solution for enhanced communications 
by offering a network based solution  the company s customers can access and use its services through a telephone or computer anywhere in the world and avoid costs associated with purchasing and maintaining technology and equipment themselves 
revenues from based services consist of usage fees from individual subscribers which are generally based on per minute rates 
revenues from based services also include license fees from corporations  primarily telecommunication carriers  under outsourcing arrangements 
license fees are also generally based on per minute rates 
voice messaging revenues generally consist of fixed monthly fees and usage fees based on the number of messages initiated by a subscriber 
although the company does not currently derive any revenues for its internet based services  management anticipates that revenues from these products will consist of both fixed monthly and usage based components 
cost of services consists primarily of transmission costs 
license customers generally arrange for  and directly bear the cost of  transmission 
consequently  while the per minute fees for licensee platform usage are lower than those for individual subscriber services  the gross margin from license arrangements is considerably higher than for subscriber services 
selling  general and administrative expenses include direct and indirect commissions  the cost of print advertisements  salaries and benefits  travel and entertainment expenses  bad debt expense  rent and facility expense  accounting and audit fees  legal fees  property taxes and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of computer and telecommunications equipment and amortization of intangible assets 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to ten years  with the exception of leasehold improvements which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets 
amortization of intangible assets includes deferred software development costs  goodwill and strategic investments and alliances  which are amortized over lives ranging from five to years 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain statements of operations items to total revenues 
year ended december  december  december  revenues cost of services gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring and other special changes accrued settlement costs total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest  net gain on contract termination other  net total other income expense net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss overview the company has achieved substantial growth particularly since its initial public offering during the first quarter of excluding restatement effects in prior years from pooling of interests acquisitions  revenues grew from million in to million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
similarly  operating profits before restructuring and other special charges grew from million to million  a compounded annual growth rate of over the same period 
the company has achieved growth in revenues and operating profits before restructuring and other special charges by pursuing its strategy to become the leading provider of enhanced communication services 
during and the company did the following 
pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its service offerings to encompass all services comprising enhanced communications 
in  the company acquired voice tel voice messaging and voicecom voice messaging and based services thereby acquiring technology necessary to offer voice messaging on a local access basis and one of the largest private networks in the world utilizing frame relay and internet protocols 
during  the company acquired telet  an enterprise engaged in computer telephony software development  which provided it with the foundation of its orchestrate service offering which integrates the company s enhanced communication services by allowing users the flexibility to utilize these services through a computer or telephone 

continued strong internal growth in the company s based business 

reduced costs by efficiently integrating its acquisitions and containing growth in other operating costs thereby enabling it to improve operating leverage from increased revenues 
analysis the company s financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to include the operations of the voice tel acquisitions and voicecom which were accounted for as poolings of interests 
the following discussion and analysis is prepared on that basis 
revenues increased to million in and to million in revenue growth was due principally to growth in the following areas 
strategic partner programs  particularly new programs such as american express  deltatel and first usa  which experienced significant increases in new subscribers  
license programs  both from growth in revenue from existing customers and new license customers  and 
new based services  including prepaid and enhanced feature calling cards which offer new features such as voice messaging through local access  call connect and call screening services and text to voice e mail 
revenues from the company s based services grew in and in gross profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
improving gross margins result primarily from changes in revenue mix toward higher margin products  primarily license arrangements for based services and voice messaging products 
in addition  the company has been able to obtain more favorable transmission rates from carriers as a result of volume discounts obtained by leveraging increasing minute volumes 
gross margins have also benefitted from general industry trends in which long distance transport and the cost of local access service costs have decreased as a result of increased capacity and competition among long distance and local exchange carriers 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and these costs declined as a percent of revenues due to aggressive restructuring of acquired businesses voice tel and voicecom in these activities included substantially reducing the workforce of acquired businesses  exiting duplicative facilities  eliminating redundant business activities and general spending reductions 
operating leverage during and has also been improved by increased revenues as the company s administrative cost structure is highly fixed in nature 
depreciation and amortization was million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in increased depreciation and amortization expense results mainly from depreciation associated with increased purchases of computer telephony equipment to support new business growth  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in connection with the voice tel acquisitions in and the worldcom strategic investment entered into in net interest expense decreased to million in  from million in and million in net interest expense decreased primarily from investment of excess proceeds from the company s initial public offering in march interest expense in and resulted mainly from indebtedness of voice tel and voicecom 
the majority of these obligations were retired in connection with the acquisitions 
accrued settlement costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and legal proceedings under item of part ii of this document for further information about this matter 
restructuring and other special charges incurred in were million compared to million in the year ended december  see note acquisitions and note restructuring and other special charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements and restructuring and other special charges which follows in this discussion 
in the years ended december  and the company s effective income tax rate was less than the statutory rate due to certain non taxable investment income and income of voice tel entities which had elected to be treated as s corporations under us tax law prior to their acquisition by the company 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its growth through cash generated by operations  proceeds from its initial public offering in march and by issuing convertible indebtedness in cash provided by operations was million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in excluding payments made for restructuring  accrued settlement costs and other special charges  cash provided by operations was million or of revenues in improving operating cash flow margins  excluding restructuring and special charges  resulted mainly from the company s integration and cost reduction initiatives associated with the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions in which reduced operating costs of these businesses 
also  the company s increasing revenue base which  because of the company s relatively fixed cost structure  improved operating leverage and profits 
in addition  operating cash flows have not been burdened by significant investment in working capital 
this is largely because a significant portion of the company s revenues are billed and collected electronically in the case of its based service customers or billed and collected in advance in the case of its voice messaging customers 
as a result  the company carried only days sales in receivables at december  as compared with approximately days of expenses in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company used cash in investing activities of approximately million in  in and million in investment of million of excess proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in and million from the company s initial public offering in accounted for a majority of the company s investing activities in and the company purchased property and equipment  primarily computer and telecommunications equipment  of approximately million in  million in and million in these expenditures were made primarily to expand operational infrastructure to support new business growth 
management anticipates that these expenditures will continue to increase in the future as the company upgrades and expands the operational infrastructure of both its existing computer telephony network and integrates the network of its recent acquisition  xpedite 
the company made investments of approximately million in in various companies engaged in emerging technologies  such as telemedicine and the internet  as well as in marketing alliances and outsourcing programs designed to reduce costs and develop new markets and distribution channels for the company s products 
management will continue to make such investments in the future in complementary businesses and other initiatives that further its strategic business plan 
the company paid approximately million of cash in connection with the acquisition of the voice tel franchisees in and million in the acquisition of telet in see note acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company utilized proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes of million in and its initial public offering proceeds of million in to support growth in its existing businesses and also to make acquisitions and other strategic investments 
in addition to cash paid to purchase certain voice tel franchisees in  the company also repaid approximately million of indebtedness in assumed in connection with the voice tel acquisitions 
cash distributions to shareholders of voicecom and certain voice tel companies  primarily s corporations  used million  million and million in  and  respectively 
such distributions were made in periods prior to the voice tel and voicecom acquisitions and were made primarily to reimburse s corporation shareholders for taxes paid on the proportionate share of taxable income of such companies they were required to report in their individual income tax returns 
at december   the company s principal commitments involve certain indebtedness  lease obligations and minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements with telecommunications providers 
the company is in compliance under all such agreements at this date 
see also note long term debt and note contingencies and commitments in notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that cash and marketable securities on hand of approximately million and cash generated by operating activities will be adequate to fund growth in the company s existing businesses for the forseeable future 
however  the company will be required to repay or refinance certain indebtedness assumed in connection with its acquisition on february  of xpedite 
such indebtedness approximates million and management is currently evaluating alternatives in this regard 
restructuring and other special charges on february   the company acquired xpedite in a transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company anticipates that it will record restructuring and other special charges before income taxes in the range of million in connection with the xpedite acquisition 
such amount includes charges recorded by xpedite in the fourth quarter of expected by management to be in the range of million before income taxes 
these charges result principally from transaction fees which the company is required to expense under the pooling of interests method of accounting  including a million transaction break up fee paid by xpedite to a company which was party to an unsuccessful attempt to acquire xpedite 
in addition  such costs result from legal and professional fees and the write down of impaired assets and associated costs to exit certain duplicative facilities and business activities 
in connection with the voicecom acquisition  the company recorded restructuring and other special charges of approximately million in the third quarter of such amounts consisted of transaction costs  asset impairments  costs to terminate or restructure certain contractual obligations and other costs 
transaction costs associated with the voicecom acquisition were expensed as required by the pooling of interests method of accounting 
other restructuring and special charges recorded in the third quarter result principally from management s plan to restructure voicecom s operations by reducing its workforce  exiting certain facilities  discontinuing duplicative product offerings and terminating or restructuring certain contractual obligations 
the company recorded approximately million of restructuring and other special charges in the second quarter of in connection with the voice tel acquisitions 
those charges result from management s plan to restructure the operations of the voice tel entities under a consolidated business group model and discontinue its franchise operations 
this initiative involves substantial reduction in the administrative workforce  abandoning duplicative facilities and assets and other costs necessary to discontinue redundant business activities 
see note restructuring and other special charges of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of in connection with the acquisition of telet  the company allocated approximately million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
accordingly  this cost was expensed as of the acquisition date 
this allocation represents the estimated value related to the incomplete projects determined by an independent appraisal 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
other matters it is possible that a significant portion of the company s currently installed computer systems  software products  billing systems  telephony platforms  networks  database or other business systems hereinafter referred to collectively as systems  or those of the company s customers  vendors or resellers  working either alone or in conjunction with other software or systems  will not accept input of  store  manipulate and output dates for the years  or thereafter without error or interruption commonly known as the year problem 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its systems to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year there can be no assurance that the company will identify all such year problems in its systems or those of its customers or vendors  including network transmission providers  in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to successfully remedy any problems that are discovered 
in addition  the company is dependent upon third parties for transmission of its calls and other communications 
there can be no assurance that these third party providers will identify and remedy any year problems in their transmission facilities 
the expenses of the company s efforts to identify and address such problems  the expenses or liabilities to which the company may be subject as a result of such problems  or the failure of third party providers of transmission facilities  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial stability of existing customers may be adversely impacted by year problems which could have a material adverse impact on the company s revenues 
in addition  failure of the company to identify and remedy year problems could put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have corrected year problems 
new accounting pronouncements in the fasb has issued sfas no

a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the company s forward looking statements  including the factors set forth in the section captioned special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements and those set forth below 
ability to manage growth  acquisition risks 
premiere continually evaluates acquisition opportunities and  as a result  frequently engages in acquisition discussions  conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engages in acquisition negotiations 
premiere has experienced substantial growth in revenue and personnel in recent years  particularly in a substantial portion of such growth has been accomplished through acquisitions  including the voice tel acquisitions  the acquisition of voicecom and the xpedite merger 
premiere s growth has placed significant demands on all aspects of premiere s business  including its administrative  technical and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by premiere  including the xpedite merger  may further strain premiere s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that premiere s systems  procedures  controls and existing space are or will be adequate to support expansion of premiere s operations 
premiere s future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its administrative  technical and financial control and reporting systems 
if premiere is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  then the quality of premiere s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
at certain stages of growth in network usage  premiere will be required to add capacity to its computer telephony platform and its digital central office switches and will need to continually add capacity to its private frame relay network  thus requiring premiere continuously to attempt to predict growth in its network usage and add capacity accordingly 
difficulties in managing continued growth  including difficulties in predicting the growth in network usage  could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions  including the xpedite merger  also involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of premiere s management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which premiere has little or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
premiere is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
future acquisitions by premiere may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the voice tel entities and voicecom established reserves for certain potential tax liabilities that premiere s management believes to be adequate based on certain assumptions which premiere s management believes are reasonable 
if  however  such assumptions prove to be incorrect and the potential liabilities ultimately exceed established reserves  premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
premiere has recorded approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the voice tel acquisitions 
premiere is amortizing the goodwill on a straight line basis over years  and premiere believes the useful life of the voice tel entities to be at least years 
if the amortization period is accelerated due to a reevaluation of the useful life of the voice tel entities or otherwise  amortization expense may initially increase on a quarterly basis or require a write down of the goodwill 
an increase in the rate of amortization of goodwill or future write downs and restructuring charges could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
premiere has taken  and in the future may take  charges in connection with acquisitions 
during the second quarter of  premiere took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the voice tel acquisitions and during the third quarter of  premiere took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voicecom 
in connection with the xpedite merger  premiere and xpedite are expected to take additional charges 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition or results of operations restructuring and other special charges 
moreover  premiere may take additional charges in connection with future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the costs and expenses incurred will not exceed the estimates upon which such charges are based 
in june  premiere completed the voice tel acquisitions 
prior to the voice tel acquisitions  the voice tel entities operated approximately pops in five countries 
vte operated as a franchisor  and each of the approximately franchisees was independently owned and operated 
premiere is in the process of consolidating these separate businesses by attempting to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary costs and to operate them under common management 
potential challenges to the successful consolidation of the voice tel entities include  but are not limited to i centralization and consolidation of financial  operational and administrative functions  ii consolidation of the service centers  network and work force  iii elimination of unnecessary costs  and iv realization of economies of scale 
premiere is in the process of integrating voice tel s service offerings  operations and systems with those of premiere  and therefore  the voice tel integration plans may materially change in the future 
challenges to the successful integration of the voice tel entities include  but are not limited to i localization of premiere products  ii integration of the premiere platform with the voice tel network  iii cross selling of products and services to the customer base of voice tel and premiere  iv integration of new personnel  and v compliance with regulatory requirements 
because of the size and fragmented nature of the facilities and businesses of the voice tel entities and the technical complexity of integrating premiere s products with those of voice tel  the integration process is particularly complex and will place significant demands on premiere s management  engineering  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the voice tel entities will be successfully consolidated or integrated with premiere s operations on schedule or at all  that the voice tel acquisitions will result in sufficient net sales or earnings to justify premiere s investment therein or the expenses related thereto  or that operational synergies will develop 
the successful consolidation of the voice tel entities and their integration into premiere s operations are critical to premiere s future performance 
failure to successfully consolidate and integrate the voice tel entities or to achieve operating synergies would have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the market for the company s services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company expects competition to increase in the future 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than the company 
the company believes that existing competitors are likely to expand their service offerings and that new competitors are likely to enter the personal communications market and to attempt to integrate such services  resulting in greater competition for the company 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering an integrated suite of enhanced personal communications services 
other providers currently offer each of the individual services and certain combinations of the services offered by the company 
the company s worldwide mobile communications services and features compete with services provided by companies such as at t corp 
at t  mci communications corp 
mci and sprint corp 
sprint as well as smaller interexchange long distance providers 
the company s voice mail services  including those acquired in the voice tel acquisitions and the voicecom acquisition  compete with voice mail services provided by at t  certain regional bell operating companies rbocs and other service bureaus as well as by equipment manufacturers  such as octel communications corporation octel  northern telecom  inc northern telecom  siemens business communications systems  inc siemens  centigram communications corporation centigram  boston technology  inc boston technology and digital sound corporation digital sound 
the company s enhanced travel  concierge  news and e mail services compete with services provided by america online  inc america online  prodigy services co 
prodigy and numerous internet service providers 
the company s paging services compete with paging services offered by companies such as at t and mci 
the company s orchestrate service  which the company anticipates beginning marketing during the second quarter of  is expected to compete with products offered by companies such as octel  microsoft corp 
microsoft  novell  inc novell  lucent technologies  inc 
lucent and numerous other entities 
for example  octel and microsoft recently announced a service  called unified messenger  which places all voice mail  e mail and fax messages in a single mailbox accessible by computer or telephone 
in addition  the number of companies offering call center technology  including at t  mci and lucent  has grown dramatically over the past few years  primarily in response to major outsource initiatives and significantly lower technology costs 
the company expects that other parties will develop and implement information and telecommunications service platforms similar to its platform  thereby increasing competition for the company s services 
through the recently completed xpedite merger  premiere offers enhanced document distribution services enhanced services 
xpedite s fax communication services currently compete with services provided by each of at t  mci and sprint  and many of the national postal  telephone and telegraph companies ptts around the world 
neither premiere nor xpedite can predict whether at t  mci  sprint  any internet service provider or ptt or any other competitor will expand its fax communications services business  and there can be no assurance that these or other competitors will not commence or expand their businesses 
moreover  xpedite s receiving  queuing  routing and other systems logic and architecture are not proprietary to xpedite  and as a result  there can be no assurance that such information will not be acquired or duplicated by xpedite s existing and potential competitors 
xpedite does not typically have long term contractual agreements with its customers  and there can be no assurance that its customers will continue to transact business with premiere in the future 
in addition  even if there is continued growth in the use of electronic document distribution services  there can be no assurance that potential customers will not elect to use their own equipment to fulfill their needs for electronic document distribution services 
there also can be no assurance that customers will not elect to use alternatives to xpedite s electronic document distribution services  including the internet  to carry such customers communications or that companies offering such alternatives will not develop product features or pricing which are more attractive to customers than those currently offered by xpedite 
furthermore  on february   president clinton signed into law the telecommunications act of  as amended the act  which allows local exchange carriers lecs  including the rbocs  to provide long distance telephone service between local access and transport areas latas  which will likely significantly increase competition for long distance services 
the new legislation also grants the federal communications commission the fcc the authority to deregulate other aspects of the telecommunications industry  which in the future may  if authorized by the fcc  facilitate the offering of an integrated suite of information and telecommunications services by regulated entities  including the rbocs  in competition with the company 
such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
telecommunications companies compete for consumers based on price  with major long distance carriers conducting extensive advertising campaigns to capture market share 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by the major long distance carriers or other competitors  whether caused by general competitive pressures or the entry of the rbocs and other lecs into the long distance market  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than the technology of the company 
the company does not have the contractual right to prevent its premiere worldlink subscribers from changing to a competing network  and the company s subscribers may generally terminate their service with the company at will 
dependence on key management and personnel 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its executive officers and other key personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  chairman and president  and certain other key executives 
mr 
jones has entered into an employment agreement with the company which expires in december  and the company maintains key man life insurance on mr 
jones in the amount of million 
during the fourth quarter of  d 
gregory smith  a co founder of the company  resigned as a director  executive vice president and assistant secretary of the company and as a director and officer of pci and certain other subsidiaries  and leonard a 
denittis resigned as the vice president of engineering and operations of pci 
the company also believes that to be successful it must hire and retain highly qualified engineering and product development personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
the inability of the company to locate  hire and retain such personnel may have a material adverse effect on the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
reliance on amway and certain other relationships 
historically  the voice tel entities have relied on sales through amway corporation amway for a substantial portion of their revenue 
such sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for  and  respectively 
amway s relationship with vte commenced in when vte began managing the voice messaging operations previously conducted by amway s subsidiary  amvox  inc amvox 
vte subsequently acquired and franchised the former amvox service centers from amway in exchange for an equity interest in vte 
amway later invested in the development of the private frame relay digital messaging network through vtn 
as a result of these transactions  amway also became the single largest equity holder in vte and vtn 
vte and amway have entered into a service and reseller agreement the amway agreement providing  among other things  for the sale by vte of voice messaging and network transmission services on an exclusive basis to amway in the united states  canada  new zealand and australia for resale by amway to its independent distributors under the amvox tradename 
the amway agreement does not bind the amway distributors  who are free to acquire messaging services from alternative vendors 
the amway agreement may be canceled by either party upon days prior written notice or upon shorter notice in the event of a breach 
the amway agreement does not prohibit vte from continuing to provide voice messaging and network transmission services to amway s distributors following termination of the amway agreement 
however  in the event that amway recommended a voice messaging and network transmission services provider other than the company  there can be no assurance that amway s distributors would not follow such recommendation 
amway sold a significant portion of the common stock that it acquired in the voice tel acquisitions in an offering pursuant to a demand registration by certain former owners of the voice tel entities 
such sale decreased amway s interest in the company and may increase the possibility that amway will recommend a voice messaging and network transmission services provider other than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s relationship with amway and the amway distributors will continue at historical levels or at all  nor can there be any assurance of long term price protection for services provided to amway 
loss or diminution in the amway relationship  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in september  premiere entered into an agreement with digitec  inc digitec pursuant to which digitec will act as a distributor to market and sell prepaid telephone cards 
under the terms of such agreement  digitec agreed  starting january   to sell cards with a minimum retail value each month 
in the event that digitec has not sold all of the cards by august   digitec will be obligated to pay premiere an amount equal to the retail value of the unsold cards less commissions that would have been payable on such cards 
digitec is not currently selling the monthly minimum amount and no assurance can be given that digitec will be able to sell the amount of cards that it is obligated to sell under the terms of such agreement 
in the event that digitec is unable to do so  the company believes that it is unlikely that digitec would have the financial resources available to it to make the payment required on august  under such agreement 
technological change  risk of obsolescence  dependence on new services 
the market for the company s services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to anticipate industry standards  continue to apply advances in technologies  enhance its current services  develop and introduce new services in a timely fashion  enhance its software and its computer telephony platform and compete successfully with products and services based on evolving or new technologies 
the company expects new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced which will compete with the services offered by the company 
among the new and evolving technologies with which the company expects to compete are notebook computers equipped with sound cards  fax modems and cellular modems  portable internet appliances which would allow connection to the internet over wireless networks and personal digital assistants with enhanced communications features 
in addition  aspects of the company s orchestrate product line  which has been marketed to customers during the first quarter of  is expected to compete within markets where larger companies are working to provide a unified messaging solution 
the company is also aware that products currently exist which provide text to voice e mail conversion and call connect call screening services 
through the recently completed xpedite merger  premiere offers enhanced services 
see risks associated with expansion of enhanced document distribution services 
technological advances may result in the availability of new services  products or methods of electronic document delivery that could compete with the electronic document distribution services currently provided by premiere and xpedite or decrease the cost of existing products or services which could enable premiere s and or xpedite s established or potential customers to meet their own needs for electronic document distribution services more cost efficiently than through the use of premiere or xpedite or in the future through the use of the combined company s services 
in addition  premiere may experience difficulty integrating incompatible systems of acquired businesses into its network 
there can be no assurance that premiere will not be materially adversely affected in the event of such technological change or difficulty  or that changes in technology will not enable additional companies to offer services which could replace  or be more cost effective than  some or all of the services offered now by premiere or xpedite or in the future by the combined company 
the voice tel acquisitions constitute a significant investment by the company in a private frame relay network architecture 
alternative architectures currently exist  and technological advances may result in the development of additional network architectures 
there can be no assurance that the telecommunications industry will not standardize on a protocol other than frame relay or that the company s frame relay architecture will not become obsolete 
such events would require the company to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing its private frame relay network and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company must continually introduce new products in response to evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to the company s existing products 
one such new product is orchestrate  which is operational and has been available in limited release 
the company anticipates commencing marketing of the orchestrate product during the second quarter of the company believes that its competitors have not yet developed a publicly available network based product which incorporates all of the functionalities of orchestrate  although the company s competitors have developed products which the company believes offer some  but not all  of the bundled services offered through orchestrate 
there can be no assurance that i the company will be successful in developing and marketing service enhancements or new services that respond to these or other technological changes or evolving industry standards  ii the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of its services  including orchestrate  or iii its new services and the enhancements thereto  including orchestrate  will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
delays in the introduction of new services  the inability of the company to develop such new services or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance of computer telephony 
the company s future success depends upon the market acceptance of its existing and future computer telephony product lines and services 
computer telephony integrates the functionality of telephones and computers and thus represents a departure from standards for information and telecommunications services 
market acceptance of computer telephony products and services generally requires that individuals and enterprises accept a new way of exchanging information 
the company believes that broad market acceptance of its computer telephony product lines and services will depend on several factors  including ease of use  price  reliability  access and quality of service  system security  product functionality and the effectiveness of strategic marketing and distribution relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company s computer telephony products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or that such market acceptance will occur at the rate which the company currently anticipates 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  the company s computer telephony product lines and services would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited protection of proprietary rights and technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights and technology 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of the company s proprietary rights and technology 
the company s proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets which the company attempts to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in its licensing  services  reseller and distribution agreements 
the company typically attempts to protect its confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
although the company is not aware of any current or previous infringement of its proprietary rights and technology  there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights and technology will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us risks of infringement claims 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information and telecommunications services and computer telephony 
the company believes that in the ordinary course of its business third parties will claim that the company s current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights of such third parties 
no assurance can be given that actions or claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement will not be brought against the company with respect to current or future products or services  or that  if such actions or claims are brought  the company will ultimately prevail 
any such claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than the company to pursue litigation of such claims 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new or improved products and services  require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  or cause the company to discontinue use of the challenged technology  tradename or service mark at potentially significant expense to the company associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is aware of other companies that use the terms worldlink or premiere in describing their products and services  including telecommunications products and services 
certain of those companies hold registered trademarks which incorporate the names worldlink or premiere 
the company has received correspondence from a provider of prepaid calling cards which claims that the company s use of the term worldlink infringes upon its trademark rights 
in addition  the company has received correspondence from a major bank  which is among the holders of registered trademarks incorporating the term worldlink  inquiring as to the nature of the company s use of the term worldlink as part of its mark premiere worldlink 
based on  among other things  the types of businesses in which the other companies are engaged and the low likelihood of confusion  the company believes these claims to be without merit 
in october  vte received a letter from a third party claiming that certain aspects of vte s products and services may be infringing upon one or more of the third party s patents 
the company has reviewed the patent claims of the third party and does not believe that the company s products or services infringe on the claims of the third party 
no patent infringement claims against the company have been filed by the third party at this time 
should the third party file patent infringement claims against the company  the company believes that it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  the company is unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation with the third party  and any adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
even if the company were to ultimately prevail  the company s business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs 
because of this risk  the company withheld in escrow approximately  shares of common stock from the purchase price of vte and vtn 
this escrow arrangement terminates in april there can be no assurance that such escrow will be sufficient to fully cover the company s exposure in the event of litigation or an adverse outcome to the potential infringement claims 
in may  premiere received a letter from a manufacturer and marketer of certain telecommunications equipment asserting that premiere is offering certain calling card and related enhanced services  single number service and call connecting services covered by three patents held by that company and inviting premiere to obtain a license 
premiere has preliminarily reviewed the subject patents and  based on that review  presently believes that its products and services currently being marketed do not infringe these patents 
premiere intends  however  to conduct a further review of these two patents in order to determine whether it would be helpful to its future products and services to license the patents 
if premiere ultimately determines that it is infringing these patents  or any one of them  it could seek to license the technology or discontinue using it and employ an alternate technology 
there can be no assurance that premiere would be able to license the technology on commercially reasonable terms or that it could easily and inexpensively migrate to a new call reorganization technology 
premiere s call reorganization service is only one service that it offers  and management does not believe that this service is critical to the marketing of premiere s overall suite of services 
consequently  premiere does not believe that its inability to license the technology or migrate to a new technology would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
no claim has been asserted beyond this letter  but no assurance can be given that the third party will not commerce an infringement action against premiere 
if a patent infringement claim is brought against premiere  there can be no assurance that premiere would prevail and any adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in may  the company received a letter from counsel for a provider of goods and services in the telecommunications field objecting to the company s use of the phrase personal assistant based on that company s federally registered personal assistant service mark 
on june   counsel for the company responded to the objections  noting that the company did not intend to use  nor would it use in the future  the words personal assistant as a trademark or service mark  but instead would merely use these words to describe the nature of its product 
the company has not heard anything further from the potential claimant and believes that the matter has been resolved 
in july  the company received a letter from counsel for a french publishing company objecting to the company s use of the premiere trademark 
based on  among other things  the type of business in which the french company is engaged and the unlikelihood that the company will engage in competitive activities using the premiere mark in france  the company believes that no action will be brought 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  however  the company is unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation with the french company  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if the company were to prevail in such a challenge  the company s business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs 
in february  the company entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax settling a patent infringement suit filed by audiofax in june in the third quarter of  the company took a one time charge for the estimated legal fees and other costs that the company expected to incur to resolve this matter 
in september  voicecom also entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax 
in july  xpedite received a letter from counsel for audiofax  which informed xpedite that audiofax is the owner of certain us and canadian patents relevant to the fax processing business  and inquired as to xpedite s interest in obtaining a license to use these patents 
the company is currently negotiating with audiofax with respect to entering into a long term  non exclusive license for use of these patents by xpedite 
in the event premiere is unable to enter into a license agreement with audio fax  the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter  including but not limited to whether or not audiofax will commence a lawsuit against xpedite 
there can be no assurance that the resolution of such matter will not have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of strategic relationships 
a principal element of the company s strategy is the creation and maintenance of strategic relationships that will enable the company to offer its services to a larger customer base than the company could otherwise reach through its direct marketing efforts 
the company has experienced growth in its existing strategic relationships during and and has entered into or initiated new strategic relationships with several companies  including worldcom  american express and compuserve 
although the company intends to continue to expand its direct marketing channels  the company believes that strategic partner relationships may offer a potentially more effective and efficient marketing channel 
consequently  the company s success depends in part on the ultimate success of these relationships and on the ability of these strategic partners to market the company s services effectively 
failure of one or more of the company s strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for the company s services  or the termination of one or more of the company s relationships with a strategic partner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid consolidation 
recently worldcom  which is a strategic partner of the company  entered into an agreement to acquire mci  which competes with the company with respect to certain services 
consolidation in the communications industry  including consolidations involving the company s customers and strategic partners  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in november  the company entered into a strategic alliance agreement with worldcom  whereby worldcom is required  among other things  to provide the company with the right of first opportunity to provide certain enhanced computer telephony services for a period of at least years 
in connection with this agreement  the company issued to worldcom  shares of common stock valued at approximately million based on an independent appraisal and paid worldcom million in cash 
the company recorded the value of this agreement as an intangible asset 
while the company believes that the intangible asset will be recovered over the life of the agreement  this recoverability is dependent upon the success of the strategic relationship 
the company will continually evaluate the realizability of the intangible asset recorded  and there can be no assurance that future evaluations will not require a write down of this asset 
although the company views its strategic relationships as a key factor in its overall business strategy and in the development and commercialization of its services  there can be no assurance that its strategic partners view their relationships with the company as significant for their own businesses or that they will not reassess their commitment to the company in the future 
the company s arrangements with its strategic partners do not always establish minimum performance requirements for the company s strategic partners  but instead rely on the voluntary efforts of these partners in pursuing joint goals 
certain of these arrangements prevent the company from entering into strategic relationships with other companies in the same industry as the company s strategic partners  either for specified periods of time or while the arrangements remain in force 
in addition  even when the company is without contractual restriction  it may be restrained by business considerations from pursuing alternative arrangements 
the ability of the company s strategic partners to incorporate the company s services into successful commercial ventures will require the company  among other things  to continue to successfully enhance its existing services and develop new services 
the company s inability to meet the requirements of its strategic partners or to comply with the terms of its strategic partner arrangements could result in its strategic partners failing to market the company s services  seeking alternative providers of communications and information services or canceling their contracts with the company  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on licensing and strategic relationships 
the company has licensing relationships with companies that have chosen to outsource part or all of their communications card services to premiere 
license fees accounted for approximately of premiere s revenues in and of premiere s revenues during one licensee  communications network corporation cnc  accounted for approximately of premiere s license fees and approximately of the company s total revenues 
on august   cnc was placed into bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
cnc owed the company approximately  as of december  however  cnc s transmission provider  worldcom network services  inc  d b a wiltel  is also obligated to pay this amount to the company 
in addition  worldcom accounted for approximately of the company s license fees and approximately of the company s total revenues  and approximately of the company s license fees and of the company s total revenues 
the company believes that through a combination of new licensing agreements  the strategic alliance agreement with worldcom and increased revenues from existing licensees  the company has replaced all of the anticipated cnc revenue 
the company intends to increase its number of licensees and its licensee transaction volume in the future 
the company s success depends in part upon the ultimate success or failure of its licensees 
the telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and rapidly consolidating 
the majority of companies that have chosen to outsource communications card services to premiere are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
licensees that ceased doing business with premiere due to financial difficulties contributed in the aggregate approximately million of premiere s revenues 
although the company was able to add new licensees in and the first three quarters of  there can be no assurance that the failure of one or more of the company s licensees to develop and sustain a market for the company s services  or termination of one or more of the company s licensing relationships  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year problem 
it is possible that a significant portion of the company s currently installed computer systems  software products  billing systems  telephony platforms  networks  database or other business systems hereinafter referred to collectively as systems  or those of the company s customers  vendors or resellers  working either alone or in conjunction with other software or systems  will not accept input of  store  manipulate and output dates for the years  or thereafter without error or interruption commonly known as the year problem 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its systems to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year there can be no assurance that the company will identify all such year problems in its systems or those of its customers or vendors  including network transmission providers  in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to successfully remedy any problems that are discovered 
in addition  the company is dependent upon third parties for transmission of its calls and other communications 
there can be no assurance that these third party providers will identify and remedy any year problems in their transmission facilities 
the expenses of the company s efforts to identify and address such problems  the expenses or liabilities to which the company may be subject as a result of such problems  or the failure of third party providers of transmission facilities  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial stability of existing customers may be adversely impacted by year problems which could have a material adverse impact on the company s revenues 
in addition  failure of the company to identify and remedy year problems could put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have corrected year problems 
risks of leverage 
in connection with the issuance of its convertible notes to the public on june and july  the convertible notes  premiere incurred million in indebtedness 
as a result of this increased leverage  premiere s principal and interest obligations have increased substantially 
the degree to which premiere is leveraged could adversely affect premiere s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
premiere s increased leverage could also adversely affect its liquidity  as a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements  and in the event of a cash shortfall  premiere could be forced to reduce other expenditures and forego potential acquisitions to be able to meet such requirements 
the indenture related to the convertible notes does not contain any financial covenants or any other agreements restricting the payments of dividends  the repurchase of securities of premiere  the issuance of additional equity or the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
in december  xpedite entered into a credit agreement with certain banks which provides a million revolving credit facility  a million portion of which is available for pound sterling borrowings 
all borrowing under this credit agreement becomes due and payable on december  substantially all of the assets of xpedite collateralize the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenant provisions

in each of these instances  the company is required to notify the holders of the company s intent to register any of its common stock under the securities act and allow such holders an opportunity to include their shares of common stock in the company s registration  provided  however  that i with respect to worldcom and voicecom such notice must be given only if the company intends to register and sell newly issued shares  ii with respect to cmg ventures  lp cmg  such notice must be given only if of the shares held by cmg remain outstanding  and iii with respect to the former owners of the voice tel entities  such notice must be given only until april  these registration rights are subject to certain limitations and restrictions  including the right of the underwriters of an underwritten offering to limit the number of shares offered in such registration if such underwriter determines that the number of shares requested to be registered cannot be underwritten 
in addition  the company agreed to file a shelf registration statement for the former holders of voicecom within days after the filing of this annual report on form k  and use reasonable commercial efforts to have the registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter

premiere believes that xpedite has meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs allegations  but due to the inherent uncertainties of the litigation process  premiere is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation 
if the outcome of this litigation is adverse to xpedite  it could have a material adverse effect on xpedite s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on switching facilities and computer telephony platforms  damage  failure and downtime 
the company currently maintains switching facilities and computer telephony platforms in atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas and london  england 
the company s network service operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the equipment and data at its switching facilities against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
the company has taken precautions to protect itself and its subscribers from events that could interrupt delivery of the company s services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware and fire protection systems 
the company s network is further designed such that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
notwithstanding such precautions  and although the company has not experienced any significant downtime of its network in the last three years due to technical failures  natural disasters or similar events  there can be no assurance that a fire  act of sabotage  technical failure  natural disaster or a similar event would not cause the failure of a network server and its backup server  other portions of the company s network or one of the switching facilities as a whole  thereby resulting in an interruption of the company s services 
such an interruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its business interruption insurance  that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices or that such insurance will be sufficient to compensate the company for losses it experiences due to the company s inability to provide services to its subscribers 
factors affecting operating results  potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
special factors that may cause the company s future operating results to vary include i the unique nature of strategic relationships into which the company may enter in the future  ii changes in operating expenses resulting from such strategic relationships and other factors  iii the continued acceptance of the company s licensing program  iv the financial performance of the company s licensees  v the timing of new service announcements  vi market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s services  vii potential acquisitions  viii changes in legislation and regulation that may affect the competitive environment for the company s communications services  and ix general economic and seasonal factors 
in the future  revenues from the company s strategic relationships may become an increasingly significant portion of the company s total revenues 
due to the unique nature of each strategic relationship  these relationships may change the company s mix of expenses relative to revenues 
quarterly revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for the company s services is rapidly evolving 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
if revenue levels are below expectations  the company may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
risk of software failures or errors 
the software developed and utilized by the company in providing its services  including the orchestrate software  may contain undetected errors 
although the company generally engages in extensive testing of its software prior to introducing the software onto its network  there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any such error may result in partial or total failure of the company s network  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of subscribers to use premiere s network or the cancellation by subscribers of their service with premiere  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company maintains technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its technology errors and omissions insurance  that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices or will be sufficient to compensate the company for losses it experiences due to the company s inability to provide services to its subscribers 
dependence upon telecommunication providers  no guaranteed supply 
the company does not own a transmission network and  accordingly  depends on worldcom  lci international telecom corp 
lci  mci  sprint  the telephone company of central florida and other facilities based and non facilities based carriers for transmission of its subscribers long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured pursuant to supply agreements for terms of three to five years  subject to earlier termination in certain events 
certain of these agreements provide for minimum purchase requirements 
further  the company is dependent upon lecs for call origination and termination 
if there is an outage affecting one of the company s terminating carriers  the company s platform automatically switches calls to another terminating carrier if capacity is available 
the company has not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but no assurance can be made in this regard in the future 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business depends  in part  on its ability to continue to obtain telecommunication services on favorable terms from long distance carriers and the cooperation of both interexchange and lecs in originating and terminating service for its subscribers in a timely manner 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls would result in a loss of revenues by the company and could lead to a loss of subscribers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company leases capacity on the worldcom backbone to provide connectivity and data transmission within the company s private data network 
the lease agreement expires in september the company s hub equipment is collocated at various worldcom sites pursuant to co location agreements that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
the company s ability to maintain network connectivity is dependent upon its access to transmission facilities provided by worldcom or an alternative provider 
the company has no assurance that it will be able to continue such relationship with worldcom beyond the terms of its current agreements with worldcom or that it will be able to find an alternative provider on terms as favorable as those offered by worldcom or on any other terms 
if the company were required to relocate its hub equipment or change its network transmission provider  it could experience shutdowns in its service and increase costs which could have a material adverse effect on its customer relationships and customer retention and  therefore  its business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on supplier of voice messaging equipment 
the company does not manufacture voice messaging equipment used at its voice messaging service centers  and such equipment is currently available from a limited number of sources 
although the company has not historically experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment required for its operations and believes that viable alternative suppliers exist  no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the future or that alternative suppliers will be available 
the inability of the company to obtain this equipment could result in delays or reduced delivery of messages which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulation 
various regulatory factors affect the company s financial performance and its ability to compete 
the company s operating subsidiaries that provide regulated long distance telecommunications services operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions pucs  and are otherwise affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by these agencies 
fcc rules currently require interexchange carriers to permit resale of their transmission services 
fcc rules also require lecs to provide all interexchange carriers with equal access to local exchange facilities for purposes of origination and termination of long distance calls 
if either or both of these requirements were eliminated  the company could be adversely affected 
moreover  the underlying carriers that provide services to the operating subsidiaries or that originate or terminate the operating subsidiaries traffic may increase rates or experience disruptions in service due to factors outside the company s control  which could cause the operating subsidiaries to experience increases in rates for telecommunications services or disruptions in transmitting their subscribers long distance calls 
pci  one of the operating subsidiaries  has made the requisite filings with the fcc to provide interstate and international long distance services 
voicecom systems  inc vcom  another operating subsidiary  is in the process of making the requisite filings with the fcc to provide interstate and international long distance services 
there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve vcom s filings 
failure by vcom to comply with fcc requirements in connection with its provision of interstate and international long distance services could have a material adverse effect on the company s or on vcom s business  financial condition and results of operation 
in order to provide intrastate long distance service  the operating subsidiaries generally are required to obtain certification from state pucs  to register with such state pucs or to be found exempt from registration by such state pucs 
each of pci and vcom has either filed the applications necessary to provide intrastate long distance telecommunications services throughout the united states or is in the process of filing such applications 
to date  pci is authorized to provide long distance telecommunications services in states and in the district of columbia and is seeking authorization to provide long distance telecommunications services in four states 
with the exception of three states  colorado  michigan and arizona  in which pci s applications to provide operator service ie  are pending  pci is authorized to provide operator service in each state where pci provides long distance telecommunications service 
vcom  on the other hand  is authorized to provide long distance telecommunications services in states and in the district of columbia and is in the process of filing applications for certificates to provide long distance telecommunications services in states 
the operating subsidiaries facilities do not prevent subscribers from using the facilities to make long distance calls in any state  including states in which the operating subsidiaries currently are not authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services and operator services 
there can be no assurance that the operating subsidiaries provision of long distance telecommunications and operator services in states where the operating subsidiaries are not authorized to provide such services will not have a material adverse effect on the company s or on the operating subsidiaries business  financial condition and results of operations 
the act is intended to increase competition in the long distance and local telecommunications markets 
the act opens competition in the local services market and  at the same time  contains provisions intended to protect consumers and businesses from unfair competition by incumbent lecs  including the rbocs 
the act allows rbocs to provide long distance service outside of their local service territories but bars them from immediately offering in region interlata long distance services until certain conditions are satisfied 
an rboc must apply to the fcc to provide in region interlata long distance services and must satisfy a set of pro competitive criteria intended to ensure that rbocs open their own local markets to competition before the fcc will approve such application 
further  while the fcc has final authority to grant or deny such rboc application  the fcc must consult with the department of justice to determine if  among other things  the entry of the rboc would be in the public interest  and with the relevant state to determine if the pro competitive criteria have been satisfied 
while the fcc has yet to grant any rboc inter lata application  the company is unable to determine how the fcc will rule on any such applications in the future 
in response to a constitutional challenge filed by sbc communications inc  the united states district court for the northern district of texas found the act s restrictions on rboc interlata services to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder  but stayed the effect of its decision pending further appeal 
as a result of the act and if the interlata restrictions are ultimately struck down  the company may experience increased competition from others  including the rbocs 
in addition  the operating subsidiaries may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and fees  including universal service assessments and payphone compensation surcharges resulting from the implementation of the act 
in conducting its business  the company is subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code and is also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
congress has held hearings regarding  and various agencies are considering  whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
for example  the federal reserve recently completed a study  directed by congress  regarding the propriety of applying regulation e to stored value cards 
the department of treasury recently promulgated proposed rules applying record keeping  reporting and other requirements to a wide variety of entities involved in electronic commerce 
it is possible that congress  the states or various government agencies could impose new or additional requirements on the electronic commerce market or entities operating therein 
if enacted  such laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on the company s business and industry and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s proposed international activities also will be subject to regulation by various international authorities and the inherent risk of unexpected changes in such regulation 
risks associated with international expansion 
a key component of the premiere strategy is its planned expansion into international markets 
in  the company opened a pop site in london  england which is currently being upgraded to a full switching facility and computer telephony platform 
in addition  the company intends to pursue long term strategic relationships with european partners 
premiere also intends to establish high speed client server networks of personal computers called telnodes and pcs utilizing the company s proprietary software called network managers in canada  new zealand and potentially other countries in the company currently has voice messaging service centers in canada  australia  new zealand and puerto rico  if international revenues are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these international operations  premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to date  premiere has only limited experience in marketing and distributing its services internationally 
there can be no assurance that premiere will be able to successfully establish the proposed international telnodes and network managers or to market  sell and deliver its services in international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty as to premiere s ability to expand its international presence  there are certain difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  export restrictions  export controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company denominates foreign transactions in foreign currency and does not engage in hedging transactions 
the company has not experienced any material losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  but there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
premiere recently completed the xpedite merger 
a significant portion of xpedite s business is conducted outside the united states and a significant portion of its revenues and expenses are derived in foreign currencies 
accordingly  xpedite s results of operations may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies 
many aspects of xpedite s international operations and business expansion plans are subject to foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of xpedite within such governments countries  including increased tariffs 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to xpedite s operations and growth strategy 
risks associated with expansion of enhanced document distribution services 
premiere intends to accelerate growth of enhanced document distribution services throughout the world by expansion of xpedite s proprietary private world wide document distribution network the xpedite network  the integration of the xpedite network with premiere s private frame relay network and computer telephony platform and the acquisition of entities engaged in the business of enhanced document distribution services 
there can be no assurance that premiere will be able to expand its ability to provide services at a rate or in a manner satisfactory to meet the demands of existing or future customers  including  but not limited to  increasing the capacity of the xpedite network to process increasing amounts of document traffic  integrating and increasing the capability of the xpedite network to perform tasks required by premiere s customers or identifying and establishing alliances with new partners in order to enable premiere to expand its network in new geographic regions 
such inability may adversely affect customer relationships and perceptions of premiere in the markets in which it provides services  which could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  such growth will involve substantial investments of capital  management and other resources 
there can be no assurance that premiere will generate sufficient cash for future growth of the enhanced document distribution services business through earnings or external financings  or that such external financings will be available on terms acceptable to premiere or that premiere will be able to employ any such resources in a manner that will result in accelerated growth 
risk of loss from returned transactions  fraud  bad debt  theft of services 
premiere uses two principal financial payment clearance systems the federal reserve s automated clearing house for electronic fund transfers  and the national credit card systems for electronic credit card settlement 
in its use of these established payment clearance systems  premiere generally bears credit risks similar to those normally assumed by other users of these systems arising from returned transactions caused by insufficient funds  stop payment orders  closed accounts  frozen accounts  unauthorized use  disputes  theft or fraud 
from time to time  persons have gained unauthorized access to premiere s network and obtained services without rendering payment to premiere by unlawfully using the access numbers and personal identification numbers pins of authorized users 
in addition  in connection with premiere s wholesale prepaid telephone card relationships  premiere has experienced unauthorized activation of prepaid telephone cards 
no assurance can be given that losses due to unauthorized use of access numbers and pins  unauthorized activation of prepaid calling cards or activation of prepaid calling cards in excess of the prepaid amount  or theft of prepaid calling cards will not be material 
premiere attempts to manage these risks through its internal controls and proprietary billing system 
premiere s computer telephony platform is designed to prohibit a single access number and pin from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to the platform  and premiere establishes preset spending limits for each subscriber 
premiere also maintains reserves for such risks 
past experience in estimating and establishing reserves and premiere s historical losses are not necessarily accurate indicators of premiere s future losses or the adequacy of the reserves established by premiere in the future 
although premiere believes that its risk management and bad debt reserve practices are adequate  there can be no assurance that premiere s risk management practices  including its internal controls  or reserves will be sufficient to protect premiere from unauthorized or returned transactions or thefts of services which could have a material adverse effect on premiere s business  financial condition and results of operations 
anti takeover effects of certain provisions of articles of incorporation  bylaws and georgia law 
the board of directors of the company is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
the company s articles of incorporation  as amended the articles  divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
one class will be elected each year 
the classification of the board of directors could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company 
the company is also subject to certain provisions of the georgia business corporation code which relate to business combinations with interested shareholders 
in addition to considering the effects of any action on the company and its shareholders  the company s articles permit the board of directors and the committees and individual members thereof to consider the interests of various constituencies  including employees  customers  suppliers  and creditors of the company  communities in which the company maintains offices or operations  and other factors which such directors deem pertinent  in carrying out and discharging the duties and responsibilities of such positions and in determining what is believed to be in the best interests of the company
