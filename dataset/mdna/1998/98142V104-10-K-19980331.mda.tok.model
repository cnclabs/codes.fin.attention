item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below relates to the operations of world airways  inc world airways or the company as reflected in its financial statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
therefore  this report contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the reliance on key strategic alliances  fluctuations in operating results and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these risks could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
world airways was organized in march and became a wholly owned subsidiary of worldcorp  inc worldcorp in a holding company reorganization in in february  pursuant to an october agreement  worldcorp sold of its ownership to mhs berhad mhs  a malaysian aviation company 
effective december   worldcorp increased its ownership in the company to through the purchase of of world airways common stock held by mhs 
in october  the company completed an initial public offering in which  shares were issued and sold by the company and  shares were sold by worldcorp 
on september   the company purchased  shares of its common stock from worldcorp 
at december   worldcorp and mhs owned and  respectively  of the outstanding common stock of world airways 
the balance was publicly traded 
effective january   the company purchased  shares of its common stock from mhs in accordance with the shareholders agreement see note of notes to financial statements in item 
therefore  effective january   worldcorp and mhs own and  respectively  of the outstanding common stock of world airways  with the balance publicly traded 
on august   the company completed a private offering  issuing million of convertible senior subordinated debentures the debentures due in the offering 
the debentures were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission 
the debentures are unsecured obligations  convertible into shares of the company s common stock at per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  and subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
in the event of a change in control of the company  as defined  the holders of the debentures could require the company to repurchase the outstanding debentures 
the debentures are not redeemable by the company prior to august  the company s intended use of net proceeds of the offering was to repurchase approximately million shares of its common stock  repay certain indebtedness  increase working capital and for general corporate purposes 
after completion of the offering  the company repaid approximately million as full settlement of an outstanding spare parts loan 
in addition  failure by the company to repurchase at least million shares of common stock within days after the sale of the debentures would constitute a repurchase event whereby each holder of the debentures would have the right  at the holder s option  to require the company to repurchase such holder s debentures at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
as discussed below  the company fulfilled its million share repurchase requirement in accordance with the terms stipulated in the offering 
in  world airways instituted a program to purchase up to one million shares of its publicly traded common stock pursuant to open market transactions 
as of march   world airways had purchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million pursuant to such program 
the company does not intend to purchase any additional shares at this time 
in connection with the above mentioned offering  the company and worldcorp  inc worldcorp entered into an agreement the agreement for the purchase by world airways of up to million shares of common stock owned by worldcorp at a purchase price of per share 
on september   the company purchased  shares of its common stock from worldcorp for approximately million 
mhs has certain rights under a shareholders agreement  dated as of february   as amended  among worldcorp  mhs and the company 
this agreement includes a provision that provides that if worldcorp were to dispose of its holdings in the company with the result that worldcorp s ownership interest in the company falls below of the outstanding shares of common stock  then mhs may either sell its shares to a third party or require worldcorp to sell a pro rata number of shares held by mhs to the party purchasing worldcorp s company shares 
therefore  as a result of the purchase of  shares of common stock by world airways from worldcorp  mhs had the right to sell  and accordingly sold   shares of common stock to world airways for approximately million  effective january general world airways is a global provider of long range passenger and cargo air transportation outsourcing services to major international airlines under fixed rate contracts 
the company s passenger and freight operations employ wide body aircraft which are currently operated under contracts  a substantial portion of which are with pacific rim airlines 
these contracts generally require the company to supply aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance acmi or wet lease  while the company s customers are responsible for a large portion of the other operating expenses  including fuel 
world airways airline customers have determined that outsourcing a portion of their wide body passenger and cargo requirements can be less expensive  and offers greater operational and financial flexibility  than purchasing new aircraft and additional spare parts required for such aircraft 
world airways also leads a contractor teaming arrangement that is one of the largest suppliers of commercial airlift services to the united states air force s air mobility command us air force or usaf 
in july  world airways restructured its business to focus on acmi contract services 
as such  the company ceased all scheduled passenger and scheduled charter services as of october   taking a one time charge of million as of june  see discontinuation of scheduled service operations 
the company generally charges customers on a block hour basis rather than a per seat or per pound basis 
block hours are defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its final destination 
the company provides most services under two types of contracts wet lease contracts and full service contracts 
under wet lease contracts  the company provides the aircraft  cockpit crew  maintenance and insurance and the customer provides all other operating services and bears all other operating expenses  including fuel and fuel servicing  marketing costs associated with obtaining passengers and or cargo  airport passenger and cargo handling fees  landing fees  cabin crews  catering  ground handling and aircraft push back and de icing services 
under full service contracts  the company provides fuel  catering  ground handling  cabin crew and all related support services as well 
accordingly  the company generally charges a lower rate per block hour for wet lease contracts than full service contracts  although it does not necessarily earn a lower profit 
because of shifts in the mix between full service contracts and wet lease contracts  fluctuations in revenues are not necessarily indicative of volume trends or profitability 
it is important  therefore  to measure the company s business volume by block hours flown and to measure profitability by operating income per block hour 
the company s operating philosophy is to build on its existing acmi relationships to achieve a strong platform for future growth 
world airways concentrates on acmi contracts which shift yield  load factor and certain cost risks to the customer 
the customer bears the risk of filling the aircraft with passengers or cargo and assumes a portion of the operating expenses  including fuel 
world airways has elected to emphasize its acmi business because the company perceives a number of opportunities created by a growing global economy  particularly growth in second and third world economies where the demand for airlift exceeds capacity 
world airways attempts to maximize profitability by combining its multi year acmi contracts with short term  higher yielding acmi agreements which meet the peak seasonal requirements of its customers 
the company responds opportunistically to rapidly changing market conditions by maintaining a flexible fleet of aircraft that can be deployed in a variety of configurations 
as noted above  the company has focused its business on acmi contract services 
as is common in the air transportation industry  the company has relatively high fixed aircraft costs 
world airways operates a fleet of eight md and four dc wide body aircraft  and while the company believes that the lease rates on its md aircraft are favorable relative to lease rates of other md operators  the company s md aircraft have higher lease costs although lower operating costs than its dc aircraft 
therefore  achieving high average daily utilization of its aircraft particularly its md aircraft at attractive yields are important factors to the company s financial results 
in addition to fixed aircraft costs  a portion of the company s labor costs are fixed due to monthly minimum guarantees to cockpit crewmembers and flight attendants 
factors that affect the company s ability to achieve high utilization in its acmi business include the compatibility of the company s aircraft with customer needs and the company s ability to react on short notice to customer requirements which can be unpredictable due to changes in traffic rights  aircraft delivery schedules and aircraft maintenance requirements 
other factors that affect the acmi business include particular domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  as well as a trend toward aviation deregulation which is increasing the number of alliances and code share arrangements 
significant customer relationships in  the company s business relied heavily on its contracts with malaysian airline system berhad malaysian airlines  philippine airlines  inc philippine airlines  pt garuda indonesia garuda and the pt air force 
for the year ended december   these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours 
in  these customers provided approximately    and  respectively  of the company s revenues and    and  respectively  of total block hours flown from continuing operations 
malaysian airlines 
world airways has provided wet lease services to malaysian airlines since  providing wet lease services for malaysian airlines scheduled passenger and cargo operations as well as transporting passengers for the annual hadj pilgrimage 
mhs  which owned of the company as of january   also owns of malaysian airlines 
the company also entered into a month agreement for year round operations including the hadj with malaysian airlines whereby the company is providing two passenger aircraft with cockpit crews  maintenance and insurance to malaysian airlines newly formed charter division through may however  the company agreed to a five month reduction in the utilization of one aircraft during  although the aircraft was redeployed in other activity 
malaysian airlines has not informed the company of any reductions for the company provided three aircraft for hadj operations 
mas received notice from the malaysian hadj board that mas would not participate in the hadj pilgrimage 
as a result  mas entered into an agreement on behalf of the company for the company to provide two dc aircraft to fly in the indian hadj 
the company has a long term contract to operate three md cargo aircraft for malaysian airlines 
however  beginning in july  and as mutually agreed by the parties  world airways redeployed two cargo aircraft  which had been operating under these contracts  into another contract which ended in february the company and malaysian airlines are currently discussing the redeployment of these aircraft back into malaysian airlines operations during in order to meet the contracts original obligations 
the company can provide no assurances  however  that the company will  in fact  be able to do so 
malaysian airlines is subject to the financial difficulties associated with the adverse economic conditions in malaysia and the asia pacific region  but it has remained current with its payments for committed block hour minimums provided in the contracts 
failure by malaysian airlines to meet its aircraft lease obligations  if not offset by other business  would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
garuda 
the company has flown for garuda periodically since and yearly since since  the company has been one of the largest providers of passenger services to indonesia for the hadj pilgrimage 
the indonesian hadj pilgrimage is the world s largest due to the size of indonesia s islamic population 
in  approximately  of the  indonesians who traveled to jeddah for the hadj pilgrimage flew on the company s aircraft 
the company has reached an agreement with garuda to operate six aircraft during the pilgrimage 
philippine airlines 
the company had agreements with philippine airlines to operate four passenger aircraft until november as a result of the economic distress experienced in the philippines  the company negotiated to terminate the agreements on two of the aircraft effective in august  and received monthly termination payments totaling million through the original end of the agreements in november in addition  the contracts on the remaining two aircraft were extended until february and the per block hour rates for those two aircraft were reduced slightly 
the two aircraft which were removed from philippine airlines service were redeployed by the company under agreements with other customers 
the contract with philippine airlines expired in february us air force 
the company has provided international air transportation to the us air force since in exchange for requiring pledges of aircraft to the civil reserve air fleet craf for use in times of national emergency  the us air force grants awards to craf participants for peacetime transportation of personnel and cargo 
although the company s agreements with the usaf provide for full service contracts with certain minimum performance requirements  the company has risks similar to an acmi agreement because the usaf agreements are cost plus contracts at attractive rates 
the overall downsizing of the us military places a premium on the mobility of the us armed forces 
this is reflected in the stable size over the past several years of the usaf s procurement of commercial airlift services 
it is uncertain  however  what impact  if any  the instability within the middle east will have upon the company s future flight operations 
the usaf awards points to air carriers acting alone or through teaming arrangements in proportion to the number and type of aircraft such carriers make available to craf 
the company utilizes such teaming arrangements to maximize the value of potential awards 
the company leads a contractor teaming arrangement that enjoys a large market share of the usaf s overall commercial airlift requirement 
during a period in which the us military downsized substantially  the company s portion of the fixed usaf award increased from million for the government s fiscal year  to million for the government s fiscal year 
the current annual contract commenced on october  and expires on september  world airways  however  cannot determine how future cuts in military spending may affect future operations with the us air force 
vasp 
the company leased a cargo plane to viacao aereo sao paulo vasp  a brazilian airline  under an acmi contract which began in june and terminated prior to december  world airways also during entered into a memorandum of agreement with vasp for the lease of two md passenger aircraft for a six month term with a six month renewal option 
this contract was not finalized in and the company currently is not contracting with vasp for any aircraft 
the aircraft intended for vasp have been redeployed to other customers of the company 
although the company s customers bear the financial risk of filling the company s aircraft with passengers or cargo  the company can be affected adversely if its customers are unable to operate the company s aircraft profitably  or if one or more of the company s customers experience a material adverse change in their market demand  financial condition or results of operations 
under these circumstances  the company can be adversely affected by receiving delayed or partial payments or by receiving customer demands for rate and utilization reductions  flight cancellations  and or early termination of their agreements 
see note of the company s notes to financial statement in item as a result of these and other contracts  the company had an overall contract backlog at december  of million  compared to million at december  approximately million of the backlog relates to operations during the company s backlog for each contract is determined by multiplying the minimum number of block hours guaranteed under the applicable contract by the specified hourly rate under such contract 
approximately of the backlog relates to its contracts with malaysian airlines  included in which are the revenues associated with the three cargo aircraft for malaysian airlines see significant customer relationships malaysian airlines for further discussion of these contracts 
consistent with prior years  the company has substantial uncontracted capacity in the third and fourth quarters of and beyond 
although there can be no assurance that it will be able to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity  the company is actively seeking customers for and beyond  and has historically been successful in obtaining new customers 
the company s financial results and financial condition would be affected adversely if the company is unable to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity 
the information regarding major customers and foreign revenue is contained in note major customers of the company s notes to financial statements in item competition the market for outsourcing air passenger and cargo acmi services is highly competitive 
certain of the passenger and cargo air carriers against which the company competes possess substantially greater financial resources and more extensive facilities and equipment than those which are now  or will in the foreseeable future become  available to the company 
the company believes that the most important bases for competition in the acmi outsourcing business are the age of the aircraft fleet  the passenger  payload and cubic capacities of the aircraft  and the price  flexibility  quality and reliability of the air transportation service provided 
competitors in the acmi outsourcing market include martinair holland  tower air and american transair and all cargo carriers  such as atlas air  gemini air cargo  polar air cargo and kitty hawk  and scheduled and non scheduled passenger carriers which have substantial belly capacity 
the ability of the company to continue to grow depends upon its success in convincing major international airlines that outsourcing some portion of their air passenger and cargo business remains more cost effective than undertaking passenger or cargo operations with their own incremental capacity and resources 
the allocation of military air transportation contracts by the usaf is based upon the number and type of aircraft a carrier  alone or through a teaming arrangement  makes available for use in times of national emergencies 
the formation of competing teaming arrangements comprised of larger partners than those sponsored by the company  an increase by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the emergency program  or the withdrawal of the company s current partners  could adversely affect the size of the usaf contracts  if any  which are awarded to the company in future years 
cyclical nature of air carrier business the company operates in a challenging business environment 
the air transportation industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions 
since a substantial portion of passenger airline travel both business and personal is discretionary  the industry tends to experience severe adverse financial results during general economic downturns and can be adversely affected by unexpected global political developments 
the financial results of air cargo carriers are also adversely affected by general economic downturns due to the reduced demand for air cargo transportation 
in and  the combination of a generally weak global economy and the depressed state of the air transportation industry adversely affected the company s operating performance 
seasonality historically  the company s business has been significantly affected by seasonal factors 
during the first quarter  the company typically experiences lower levels of utilization and yields due to lower demand for passenger and cargo services relative to other times of the year 
the company experiences higher levels of utilization and yields in the second quarter  principally due to peak demand for commercial passenger services associated with the annual hadj pilgrimage 
in  the company s flight operations associated with the hadj pilgrimage will occur from february to may because the islamic calendar is a lunar based calendar  the hadj pilgrimage occurs approximately to days earlier each year relative to the western gregorian calendar 
as a result  revenues resulting from future hadj pilgrimage contracts will continue to shift from the second quarter to the first quarter over the next several years 
geographic concentration the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and block hours from its operations in the pacific rim region 
any further economic decline or any military or political disturbance in this area may interfere with the company s ability to provide service in this area 
in  the affects of the adverse economic conditions in malaysia and indonesia and other countries in the asia pacific region included a national liquidity crisis  significant depreciation in the value of the ringgit and rupiah  higher domestic interest rates  reduced opportunity for refinancing or refunding of maturing debts  and a general reduction in spending throughout the region 
these conditions and similar conditions in other countries in the asia pacific region could have a material adverse effect on the operations of malaysian airlines and garuda indonesia  and therefore on the operations of the company 
however  management also believes these conditions could provide new opportunities to wet lease aircraft to airlines customers  particularly those who have deferred or canceled new aircraft orders but are still in need of providing additional airlift 
utilization of aircraft due to the large capital costs of leasing and maintaining world airways aircraft  each of world airways aircraft must have high utilization at attractive rates in order for world airways to operate profitably 
although world airways strategy is to enter into long term contracts with its customers  the terms of world airways existing customer contracts are substantially shorter than the terms of world airways lease obligations with respect to the aircraft 
as mentioned above  a significant portion of world airways contract backlog at december   relates to its multi year contracts with malaysian airlines which is subject to the financial difficulties associated with the adverse economic conditions in malaysia and the asia pacific region 
in addition  the company has substantial uncontracted capacity in the third and fourth quarters of and beyond 
there can be no assurance that world airways will be able to enter into additional contracts with new or existing customers or that it will be able to obtain enough additional business to fully utilize each aircraft 
world airways financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected even by relatively brief periods of low aircraft utilization and yields 
in order to maximize aircraft utilization  world airways does not intend to acquire new aircraft unless such aircraft would be necessary to service existing needs or world airways has obtained additional acmi contracts for the aircraft to service 
world airways is seeking to obtain additional acmi contracts with new and existing customers  to which such new aircraft would be dedicated when placed in service  but world airways can provide no assurance that it will obtain new acmi contracts or that existing acmi contracts will be renewed or extended 
aircraft fleet world airways strategy is to attempt to ensure that each of the aircraft in its fleet is to a large extent contractually dedicated by world airways to the service of one or more customers  with limited aircraft available to provide back up capability 
therefore  in the event the use of one or more of world airways aircraft was lost  world airways might have difficulty fulfilling its obligations under one or more of these contracts  if it were unable to obtain substitute aircraft 
on october   one of the company s md aircraft was damaged upon landing 
the aircraft was out of service for approximately two and a half months while certain repairs were made 
the company expects insurance to cover repair and certain related costs  but the company s loss of revenues that would have been generated by the aircraft s use had an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations for the fourth quarter of maintenance engine maintenance accounts for most of the company s annual maintenance expenses 
typically  the hourly cost of engine maintenance increases as the aircraft ages 
the company outsources major airframe maintenance and power plant work to several suppliers 
the company has a year contract expiring in august with united technologies corporation s pratt whitney group for all off wing maintenance on the pw engines that power its md aircraft 
under this contract  the manufacturer agreed to provide such maintenance services at a cost not to exceed specified rates per hour during the term of the contract 
the specified rates per hour are subject to annual escalation  increasing substantially in accordingly  while the company believes the terms of this agreement have resulted in lower engine maintenance costs than it otherwise would incur  engine maintenance costs will increase substantially during the last five years of the agreement 
the company began to accrue these increased expenses in and such expenses will continue to increase during the remainder of the term of the contract as the company s aircraft fleet ages 
operating losses while the company generated operating income each year from through and in  it sustained operating losses in and of million and million  respectively  and net losses of million in each of these two years 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of million  which resulted from operating losses incurred in the company s scheduled service operations  which were discontinued in  and the related estimated loss on disposal 
earnings from continuing operations were million for while the company generated operating income for the year ended december  of million  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue generating operating income for or future years 
control by worldcorp  potential conflicts of interest as of january   worldcorp owned approximately of the outstanding world airways common stock 
worldcorp is a holding company that owns positions in two companies intelidata and world airways 
worldcorp is highly leveraged and therefore requires substantial funds to cover debt service each year 
as a holding company  all of worldcorp s funds are generated through its subsidiaries  neither of which is expected to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result of worldcorp s cash requirements  it may be required to sell additional shares of common stock  and such sales  or the threat of such sales  could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
except as limited by contractual arrangements with mhs  worldcorp also is in a position to control the outcome of many issues submitted to world airways stockholders  including the election of all of world airways board of directors  adoption of amendments to world airways certificate of incorporation  and approval of mergers 
in connection with a million loan from a commercial bank the bank loan  worldcorp had pledged all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by worldcorp the worldcorp shares 
the bank loan was scheduled to mature on september  on september   the company purchased  of its common stock from worldcorp for approximately million in cash 
worldcorp used a portion of these proceeds to retire the bank loan prior to its maturity 
subsequent to year end  the company loaned worldcorp million  which was used by worldcorp to pay debt obligations 
the loan is collateralized by one million shares of the company s stock owned by worldcorp and bears interest at prime plus 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total block hours decreased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft decreased to hours in from hours in in  the company continued to obtain a higher percentage of its revenues under wet lease contracts as opposed to full service contracts 
in  wet lease contracts accounted for of total block hours  an increase from in continuing operations block hours from continuing operations decreased slightly to  hours in from  hours in operating revenues 
revenues from flight operations increased million  or  in to million from million in revenues in included approximately million related to minimum guarantee payments received from malaysian airlines for flying levels which did not meet the minimum monthly levels specified in the contracts  and million related to contract modification payments received from philippine airlines  for which the company incurred no related variable costs 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in flight operations expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft costs  fuel and maintenance 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight operations expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from higher crew costs relating to an accrual for the profit sharing bonus plan  an increase in wage rates including an increase in the guarantee payment  and an increase in training costs relating to crewmember attrition  partially offset by the shift in the mix of business from full service to wet lease operations 
flight attendant costs remained consistent despite the shift to wet lease operations as a result of flight attendants receiving minimum guarantee payments 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the increase in the number of aircraft dedicated to the company s continuing operations and the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet during in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with the md aircraft and related engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties which began to expire in and will fully expire by the company expects its maintenance expense to increase further in due to escalations in the specified rates per hour under the company s maintenance agreement 
the increase was partially offset by a reversal in of million of accrued maintenance expense in excess of the cost of an overhaul of a dc aircraft 
aircraft costs increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted from the increase in the number of aircraft dedicated to the company s continuing operations  primarily due to the lease of two md er aircraft in march  and the lease of additional spare engines necessary to maintain the expanded fleet 
this increase was partially offset by the reversal of approximately million in lease costs  which had been recorded in  as a result of a settlement with the engine manufacturer for reimbursements related to disputed spare engine lease charges 
fuel expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease is due primarily to the shift from full service to wet lease operations where the company is not responsible for fuel costs 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in price per gallon 
promotions  sales and commissions increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in commissions related to increased flying during under the philippine airlines contract 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from depreciation on the increased levels of spare parts required to support the additional md aircraft described above  partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of certain intangible assets 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel  beginning in the second quarter of  necessary to support the growth in the company s core business and related marketing efforts and an increase in property tax accruals 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in certain legal and professional fees 
interest expense increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the issuance of million of senior subordinated debentures on august  discontinued operations the company commenced service between tel aviv and new york in july in the first quarter of  the company generated million in losses related to these operations 
in the second quarter of  the company expanded its scheduled service operations with service between the united states and south africa and introduced scheduled charter operations between the united states and various destinations within europe 
as the company was unable to operate these scheduled service operations profitably  in july  the company announced its decision to exit its scheduled service operations by october and focus its operations on its core wet lease operations 
consistent with this decision  world airways ceased all scheduled operations as of october  as a result  the company s scheduled service operations were reflected as discontinued operations as of june   and prior period results were restated to reflect scheduled service operations as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations net of income tax effect approximated million for the year ended december  in addition  an estimated loss on disposal of million net of income tax effect was recorded as of june  the company recognized an additional million of expense in the fourth quarter of and believes that substantially all the costs relating to the disposal have been recorded as of december  the company is subject to claims arising as a result of the discontinuance of its scheduled service operations  but the company believes it has substantial defenses to these actions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total block hours increased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft decreased to hours in from hours in in  the company continued to obtain a higher percentage of its revenues under wet lease contracts as opposed to full service contracts 
in  wet lease contracts accounted for of total block hours  consistent with in total operating revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in continuing operations block hours from continuing operations increased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in operating revenues 
revenues from flight operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in military flying and an increase in revenues generated from its hadj operations and services to certain international carriers  partially offset by a decrease in cargo operations resulting from a shift in the mix of business during operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in flight operations expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft cost  fuel and maintenance 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight operations expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in block hours flown and higher crew costs and up front training expenses in connection with the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accrued profit sharing expenses 
in  the company accrued profit sharing expenses as a result of earnings experienced during that period 
no such accrual was necessary in as a result of losses from the discontinuation of scheduled service operations 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet and a corresponding increase in block hours flown 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with the md aircraft and related engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties which began to expire in and will fully expire by aircraft costs increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the lease of two md er aircraft in the first quarter of and the lease of incremental dc aircraft which began in the second and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  partially offset by the return of two dc aircraft to the lessor in the third quarter of fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase is due primarily to an increase in fuel utilized in connection with its military operations and a slight increase in price per gallon 
promotions  sales and commissions increased million in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from commissions paid in connection with the new philippine airlines contract and an increase in teaming arrangement commissions associated with the larger fixed award contract received from the us air force beginning october depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in spare parts required to support the additional md aircraft and incremental dc aircraft described above 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel necessary to support the growth in the company s core business and an increase in certain legal and professional fees

loss from discontinued operations net of income tax effect approximated million for the year ended december  in addition  an estimated loss on disposal of million net of income tax effect was recorded as of june  liquidity and capital resources the company is highly leveraged 
the company incurred substantial debt and lease commitments during the past four years in connection with its acquisition of md aircraft and related spare parts 
in addition  the company issued million of convertible debentures in august  as discussed below 
as of december   the company had outstanding long term debt and capital leases of million  and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations  including debt service costs  of million 
in addition  the company has significant future long term obligations under aircraft lease obligations relating to its aircraft 
the company has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  public and private sales of its common stock  secured borrowings  and other financings from banks and other lenders 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences to holders of common stock  including the following i world airways ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  iii world airways degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases for aircraft  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  iv world airways ability to meet its payment obligations under existing and future indebtedness  capital leases and operating leases may be limited  and v world airways financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions 
on august   the company completed a private offering  issuing million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due in  which were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission 
the debentures are unsecured obligations  convertible into shares of the company s common stock at per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  and subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
in the event of a change in control of the company  as defined  the holders of the debentures could require the company to repurchase the outstanding debentures
