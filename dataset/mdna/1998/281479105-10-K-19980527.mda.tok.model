the company is the sole united states distributor of these books 
the company currently offers approximately different titles 
the company also distributes a product called usborne kid kits 
these kid kits take an usborne book and combine it with specially selected items and or toys which complement the information contained in the book 
the kid kits are packaged in a reusable vinyl bag 
presently different kid kits are available 
the company considers the political risk of importing books from the united kingdom to be negligible as the two countries have maintained excellent relations for many years 
likewise there is little direct economic risk to the company in importing books from the united kingdom as the company pays for the books in us dollars and is not directly subject to any currency fluctuations 
there is risk of physical loss of the books should an accident occur while the books are in transit  which could cause the company some economic loss due to lost sales should the supply of some titles be depleted in the event of a lost shipment 
the company considers this to be highly unlikely as this type of loss has yet to occur 
there is some risk involved in having all sales tied to one source usborne publishing limited 
the company has an excellent working relationship with its foreign supplier usborne publishing limited and can foresee no reason for this to change

e year matters the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities
