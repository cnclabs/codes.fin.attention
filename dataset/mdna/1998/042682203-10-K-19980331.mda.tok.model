item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained in item of this report  and notes thereto 
amounts reported here have been rounded to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event such amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand 
general from its inception  the company has been engaged principally in the research  design  development and commercialization of an innovative  advanced zinc air battery 
to date  the main application for the company s technology has been a system for powering zero emission electric vehicles 
the electric fuel electric vehicle system consists of a refuelable zinc air battery comprised of a series of cells with removable zinc anode cassettes  a battery exchange system  a battery refueling system for refueling the depleted fuel cassettes  and a regeneration system for recycling the depleted cassettes 
in part  because the market for electric vehicles has not demonstrated previously anticipated levels of growth in  the company began a stategic shift to actively expand its activities into additional applications for its zinc air battery technology 
in addition to its electric vehicle application  the company is focusing efforts in developing and commercializing its battery technology for consumer electronics  defense and safety applications 
the company is developing a zinc oxygen battery for torpedoes  is developing an advanced portable zinc air battery for the us army s communications electronics command cecom  has developed and is selling a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus the survivor locator light  and is developing a primary battery for hand held electronic devices  such as cellular telephones  and laptop computers 
other than the survivor locator light  the company currently has no commercial products available for sale and does not expect to generate sales in commercial quantities in the near term 
in january  the company announced the creation of three market related divisions to expand its zinc air battery technology for wider applications 
the three divisions are electric vehicle  consumer batteries  and defense and safety products 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of its revenues and expenses  and the company believes that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not provide a meaningful indication of the development of the company 
during these periods  the company has received periodic lump sum payments relating to licensing and other revenues from its strategic partners  which have been based on the achievement of certain milestones  rather than ratably over time 
the company s expenses have been based upon meeting the contractual requirements under its agreements with various strategic partners and  therefore  have also varied according to the timing of activities  such as the need to provide prototype products and to establish and engineer refueling and regeneration facilities 
the company s research and development expenses have been offset  to some extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from the chief scientist 
the company expects that  because of these and other factors  including general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing technologies  future results of operations may not be meaningfully compared with those of other periods 
thus  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and  and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years 
these losses may increase and be incurred over a longer period of time as the company expands its research and development activities and establishes production and facilities  and such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  if any of its products are successfully commercialized  the company expects to derive revenues from the sale of components of the electric fuel electric vehicle system  including refueling and electric fuel services  batteries for portable electronic products  defense and safety products manufactured by the company  as well as from licensing rights to the electric fuel technology to third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency the company s management considers the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates and  therefore  efl has adopted and is using the united states dollar as its functional currency 
further  the company believes that the operations of efl s subsidiaries are an integral part of the israeli operations 
while a significant proportion of efl s revenues have been denominated in deutsche marks as a result of its involvement in the field test  based on the company s historical experience and the company s strategic objectives  management continues to consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates 
furthermore  revenues not related to the field test are primarily in us dollars 
transactions and balances originally denominated in united states dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income

results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for the comparable period in revenues for included fees collected in relation to a rights agreement completed with vattenfall under which vattenfall exercised its right for a license to establish and operate the electric fuel infrastructure for the territory of sweden  denmark  norway  finland and st 
petersburg  russia 
additional revenues related to vattenfall will be recognized only after a definitive license agreement has been signed 
execution of the definitive license agreement will be decided upon by vattenfall only after completion of the field test in may additionally  the company completed recognition of revenues relating to its activities in connection with the deutsche post field test program 
for  the company and the deutsche post have agreed that  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  the deutsche post will cover direct operating costs of the bremen plant and the test vehicles until may  up to a maximum amount of dm million million 
the company also completed recognition of revenues from phase of its agreement with stn atlas elektronic gmbh stn to develop a high power zinc oxygen battery for torpedoes 
in addition  the company recognized revenues from the supply of batteries and equipment to edison  as well as from the sale of survivor lights to various customers in the united states  principally in the fourth quarter 
survivor light revenues are expected to increase during revenues for the year ended december   were principally derived from activities relating to the field test  and the granting of a license to israel electric company for regeneration and refueling in israel and other neighboring countries 
additionally  the company completed recognition of revenues related to phase of its development program with stn  and began recognition of phase of its stn program 
the company also recognized revenues from edison in connection with the license granted to it 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during compared with million during the research and development expenses and cost of revenues are net of million  representing utilization of a portion of the previously accrued provision for project losses 
the company believes that  given the company s stage of development  it is not  at this time  meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
the decrease in expenses from was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses in connection with the deutsche post field test  particularly the costs of the construction of the regeneration plant in bremen  and production costs related to the supply of batteries for the field test 
this overall decrease was partially offset by increased r d expenses  both for electric vehicles as well as for batteries for portable electronic devices  and production costs related to survivor locator lights 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of royalty bearing grants in connection with the company s research and development program  including an increase of  in chief scientist grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million of chief scientist grants 
since the deutsche post and the company have agreed to extend the operations of the field test through may   expenses related to the field test are expected to continue to be incurred through the second quarter of however  direct field test expenses during  in contrast to previous years  will be fully funded by the deutsche post 
during  the salvage value for the regeneration facility in bremen was reduced by million to a value of million to reflect the company s current expectations of the value of the plant at the end of the field test 
the reduction in salvage value was offset by the elimination of the provision for anticipated program losses in the amount of million 
r d expenses and cost of operations related to consumer battery and defense and safety applications are expected to increase significantly during  as the company intensifies its efforts in these new areas  while expenses related to electric vehicle development are expected to decrease in the provision for anticipated program losses previously recorded by the company was eliminated during as the company does not expect to incur losses during on the field test 
overall  the costs of the field test incurred by the company have exceeded the related program budgeted amounts by more than and during  the company  pursuant to the terms of the field test partners agreement  entered into discussions to obtain additional funding from the deutsche post 
to date  the company has not obtained any such funding  and accordingly  the company operated only a limited number of vehicles during in the fourth quarter of  the deutsche post requested that the company refund the sum of approximately dm million approximately million representing milestone payments on account of opel batteries  which are the subject of a dispute between the deutsche post and the company 
the advances were made in accordance with mutually agreed contractual milestones  previously acknowledged by the deutsche post as having been achieved  and therefore the company does not believe that it is required to refund any of the payments 
however  until the resolution of this issue  the company has deferred recognizing this amount in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared with million in while there was a decrease in the overall amount  there were certain nonrecurring expenses included in  particularly a settlement arrangement with respect to a terminated consultant included in marketing expenses see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the above  there was an increase in selling general and administrative expenses of approximately  this was primarily attributable to increased salaries  fees and allocated overhead expenses with respect to the expanded geographic scope of the company s activities including the united states  scandinavia  and the far east  as well as from the company s diversification into new applications for its zinc air battery technology 
the company does not expect further increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in compared to  in the company  and its israeli subsidiary  efl  have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
however  for  the company s european subsidiaries had net income  which arose as a result of intercompany transactions  and they have therefore recorded a provision for income taxes  in the amount of  the company reported a net loss of million in compared with a net loss of million in due to the factors cited above 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million in the comparable period in  an increase of million 
revenues for were principally derived from activities relating to the field test program 
the balance of the revenues related to the field test are expected to be recognized in the company also recognized revenues in connection with the granting of a license to the israel electric company for zinc air battery refueling and regeneration in israel and other neighboring countries 
additionally  the company completed recognition of revenues related to phase of its development program with stn atlas elektronik gmbh stn to develop a high power zinc oxygen battery for torpedoes  and began recognition of revenues from phase of its stn program 
finally  the company recognized revenues from edison in connection with the license granted to it 
revenues for the year ended december   were principally derived from activities relating to the field test  and a grant of marketing rights and the sale of equipment to vattenfall ab when vattenfall and the swedish post joined the field test as associate partners 
in addition  revenues related to phase of the company s agreement with stn and the completion and delivery of all of the company s outstanding orders from edison were recognized in research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during net of million utilization of a portion of the previously accrued provision for project losses compared with million during these expenses for both and include expenses in connection with the field test  including costs related to construction of the bremen regeneration facility and battery production costs  costs associated with the operation of the company s production facilities in israel  and the continued development and engineering costs relating to the electric fuel system 
the company believes that  given the company s stage of development  it is not  at this time  meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
in the year ended december   the company recorded million of royalty bearing grants representing substantially all of the expected grants from the chief scientist in connection with the company s research and development program  including an increase of  in chief scientist grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million of chief scientist grants 
expenses related to the field test are expected to continue to be incurred through as the company continues to deliver batteries and operates the bremen regeneration plant 
field test expenses have substantially exceeded any expected revenues related thereto 
since the plant is currently dedicated to the field test  the cost of the plant net of anticipated residual value is reflected as a current expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in this increase was attributable to the following increased salaries  fees and allocated overhead expenses with respect to the company s expanded activities  particularly in germany  a settlement arrangement with respect to a terminated consultant included in marketing expenses see note a to the consolidated financial statements  increased severance accruals resulting from modifications to certain named executive officers employment agreements  and increased costs as the company intensified its marketing efforts into new geographic areas 
further increases in recurring selling  general and administrative expenses are expected as the company expands and its activities 
the provision for anticipated program losses previously recorded by the company reflects the program losses related to the field test currently estimated by management  and accordingly no increase to the provision was recorded in in the future  however  the provision may be increased to reflect any revised estimates of project costs 
the balance of the provision for the uncompleted portions of the program amounts to million as at december  the overall provision includes cost estimates based on the company s production experience to date for the supply of batteries and battery vehicle interface equipment  the estimated service expenses for the field test fleet and costs related to the regeneration plant in bremen  germany which is supporting the mercedes benz field test vehicles in service at december  financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differences  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in compared to  in financial income  primarily interest earned in the united states and israel from both taxable and tax exempt securities  increased to million in from  in the company incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes was required

the company reported a net loss of million in compared with a net loss of million in due to the factors cited above 
impact of year the company has begun investigating the impact of year on its computer software 
the company s materials requisition  manufacturing and inventory management software is unaffected by year problems 
however  its financial accounting and payroll applications are for the most part not year compliant 
the financial and payroll applications are off the shelf programs under service contracts with the original vendors 
these vendors have indicated that they are adapting their software to be year compliant  and while there might be certain customization and retraining expenses associated with the upgraded software  the company does not expect to incur material expenditures to resolve year issues 
the company has not yet investigated the impact regarding operating software for its manufacturing and analytical equipment 
the company is instituting a program to analyze all software in the company to ensure year compliance 
this program is expected to be completed prior to december  liquidity and capital resources as the field test comes to its conclusion in mid  the company expects a reduction in its expenditures in connection with the engineering and commercialization of the electric fuel battery for electric vehicles  that will be partially offset by both a significant increase in connection with its efforts to research and develop batteries for consumer electronic devices and various defense contracts  as well as increased production costs related to the survivor locator lights 
the company expects that its overall research and development  operational and selling  general and administrative expenses will be lower in than in  unless the company generates additional revenues which will support an increase in such expenses 
during the second quarter of  the company and deutsche post executed a letter of intent agreeing to enter into negotiations for the establishment of a joint venture entity that would provide the necessary financial and technological resources in order to continue to develop and successfully commercialize the electric fuel electric vehicle system in certain european regions 
pursuant to the letter of intent  the parties agreed to negotiate a definitive agreement by september  during september  the parties agreed to extend the timetable for negotiations until december  the letter of intent did not resolve the funding problems associated with the field test  which were expected to be resolved during the course of  or subsequent to  the negotiations on the joint venture 
in addition  the company expected to resolve the dispute with respect to the opel refund as part of these negotiations 
as of december  no definitive agreement was reached and the letter of intent automatically terminated 
in december  the deutsche post notified the company that the technology satisfied all the deutsche post requirements and that it  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  was extending the field test to may  the deutsche post has given the company no indication of what program it might support after this date  and there can be no assurance that there will be any on going relationship with the deutsche post following may  total net consideration to the company through december   for the batteries  equipment and services supplied in connection with the field test has amounted to approximately million for the fiscal years this excludes the revenues  currently deferred  in connection with the company s discussions with the deutsche post with respect to the opel batteries 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and financial investments of approximately million compared with million as of december  the company used available funds in primarily for continued research and development expenditures  the advancement of its commitments with regards to the field test  and other working capital needs 
the company increased its investment in fixed assets by  during the year ended december  following the reduction in the salvage value of the bremen facility by million  fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
fixed assets include million related to the value of the bremen facility after its use in the field test  based on recent engineering estimates 
efl presently has a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at fibi s prime rate per annum  are unconditionally guaranteed by the company and are secured by a pledge of foreign currency deposits in the amount of nis  approximately  additionally the credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on efc and efl and presently expires on may   at which time the credit facility will be reviewed for renewal by fibi 
the credit facility provides efl with a line of credit in the maximum principal amount of nis million approximately million  which can be used as credit support for various obligations of efl  and enables efl to enter into up to us million in currency hedging forward contracts with a collateral requirement 
as of december   the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  at the present time  the company is not engaged in any hedging activities 
the company has no long term debt outstanding and expects that its cash flow from operations  together with present cash reserves and amounts available under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the company s projected activities through the second quarter of if there is no ongoing program with the deutsche post  the company may decide to further scale back certain of its efforts in its electric vehicle division 
however  additional strategic alliances may require the establishment or expansion of facilities in israel or elsewhere 
in addition  the company may determine that it should invest in certain programs  such as additional electric vehicle demonstration programs  which it believes will advance the development and commercialization of the electric fuel electric vehicle system 
the company is also using its resources to research and develop other applications exploiting its proprietary technology  including batteries for consumer electronic devices 
accordingly  the company may be required to seek additional funding or pursue other options  such as joint ventures or other strategic relationships 
the company continues to consider financing alternatives when presented and  if financing becomes available on satisfactory terms  including prices  the company may obtain additional funding  including through the issuance of equity securities 
approximately of the stock of the company s israeli based subsidiary  efl  is now owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by three united states citizens 
if at any time in the future  or more of the shares of efl are held or deemed to be held by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of the company who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company fphc stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and the company could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed fphc income of efl 
for  efl has no income which would qualify as undistributed fphc income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income which qualifies as undistributed fphc income 
actual cash requirements will depend in part upon actual and anticipated sales and licenses 
the company may also be able to finance some portion of its fixed asset and equipment needs through approved enterprise grants from the government of israel 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been in us dollars  although a significant proportion of the company s revenues are currently in deutsche marks  primarily related to the field test 
the united states dollar cost of the company s operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in most recent years  inflation in israel has not been fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis  and  accordingly  the dollar cost of the company s nis expenses has increased 
the company does not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  except to the extent that such circumstances have an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december    and in  the annual rates of inflation in israel were    and  respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of    and respectively 
any decrease in the value of the deutsche mark as against the dollar would result in a decrease in the dollar value of such revenues 
while in the past  the company has engaged in currency hedging in an effort to decrease the impact of short term currency fluctuations  the company is not currently engaging in currency hedging 
effective corporate tax rate the company s production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  the investment law  and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for up to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by the investment law has not elapsed 
the company has elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate for the aforementioned period 
efl s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income distributed by the company to its stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to efc  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
efc and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
however  for  the company s european subsidiaries had net income  which arose as a result of intercompany transactions  and have therefore recorded a provision for income taxes 
as of december  the company has us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  which are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which are available to offset future taxable income  indefinitely
