item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the capital requirements of chesapeake utilities corporation chesapeake or the company reflect the capital intensive nature of its business and are attributable principally to the construction program and the retirement of outstanding debt 
the company relies on cash generated from operations and short term borrowing to meet normal working capital requirements and temporarily finance capital expenditures 
during  net cash provided by operating activities  used by investing activities and used by financing activities were million  million and million  respectively 
the board of directors has authorized the company to borrow up to million from various banks and trust companies 
as of december   chesapeake had four unsecured bank lines of credit  totaling million  for short term cash needs to meet seasonal working capital requirements and to temporarily fund portions of its capital expenditures 
the outstanding balances of short term borrowing at december  and were million and million  respectively 
in  chesapeake used cash provided by operations and the issuance of long term debt to fund capital expenditures and reduce short term borrowing 
during  the company used cash provided by operating activities and short term borrowing to fund the capital expenditures and increases in working capital requirements 
during  and  capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
chesapeake has budgeted million for capital expenditures during this amount includes million and million for natural gas and propane distribution  respectively  million for natural gas transmission   for advanced information services and  for general plant 
the natural gas and propane distribution expenditures are for expansion and improvement of facilities in existing service territories 
natural gas transmission expenditures are for improvement and expansion of the pipeline system 
the advanced information services expenditures are for computer hardware  software and related equipment 
financing for the construction program is expected to be provided from short term borrowing and cash from operations 
the construction program is subject to continuous review and modification 
actual construction expenditures may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors including inflation  changing economic conditions  regulation  sales growth and the cost and availability of capital 
chesapeake has budgeted million for environmental related expenditures during and expects to incur additional expenditures in future years see note j to the consolidated financial statements  a portion of which may need to be financed through external sources 
management does not expect such financing to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or capital resources of the company 
capital structure as of december   common equity represented of permanent capitalization compared to in and in chesapeake remains committed to maintaining a sound capital structure and strong credit ratings to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital markets when required 
this commitment  along with adequate and timely rate relief for the companys regulated operations  helps to ensure that chesapeake will be able to attract capital from outside sources at a reasonable cost 
the achievement of these objectives will provide benefits to customers and creditors  as well as to the companys investors 
financing activities in december  chesapeake finalized a private placement of million of senior notes due january  the company used the proceeds to repay a portion of its short term borrowing 
in october  the company finalized a private placement of million of senior notes due in the company used the proceeds to retire million of the senior notes of eastern shore natural gas company  the companys natural gas transmission subsidiary eastern shore originally due in the remaining proceeds were used to reduce short term borrowing 
the company issued no long term debt in during  the company repaid approximately million of long term debt  compared to  and million in and  respectively 
the increase in debt payments for resulted from the payoff of million of debt assumed in the pooling of interests with tri county gas company  inc tri county 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of tri county and associated properties 
tri county distributes propane to both retail and wholesale customers on the peninsula 
the transaction was effected through the exchange of  shares of the companys common stock and was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
chesapeake issued   and  shares of common stock in connection with its automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan during the years of  and  respectively 
results of operations net income for was  as compared to  for the decrease in net income is primarily related to temperatures in the companys northern service territory  which were  on average  warmer than in the warmer weather resulted in a reduction in volumes sold by the natural gas and propane distribution segments 
the lower gas volumes contributed to the reduction in earnings before interest and taxes ebit for both distribution segments as shown in the table below 
earnings before interest and taxes in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease ebit by business segment natural gas distribution       natural gas transmission       propane distribution      advanced information services     other total ebit      chesapeakes net income was  as compared to  for although net income was relatively unchanged  the contribution to net income from each business segment differed during the two year period 
natural gas distribution ebit was higher in due to rate increases placed in effect in two of the three service territories during ebit for the propane distribution segment increased due to greater volumes sold due to temperatures being colder than in natural gas transmissions contribution decreased due to a reduction in volumes sold to industrial interruptible customers during in addition  net income includes a one time benefit from a settlement with the federal energy regulatory commission see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
natural gas distribution the reduction in ebit of million from to is primarily related to a decline in total gross margin  as indicated in the following table  coupled with an overall increase in expenses 
the reduction in gross margin earned on volumes sold is primarily the result of a decline in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers and a decrease in volumes sold to industrial interruptible customers in chesapeakes florida service territory 
the reduction in volumes sold to residential and commercial customers was directly related to warmer temperatures  primarily during the first quarter of operations and maintenance expenses increased  and  respectively 
compensation  regulatory commission expenses and costs related to data processing and billable service revenue contributed to the increase in operations expenses 
a greater level of maintenance to the gas pipeline system resulted in an increase in maintenance expenses 
the million rise in ebit from to resulted from an increase in gross margin earned on sales of natural gas in two of chesapeakes three service territories  offset by an overall increase in expenses 
the million increase in gross margin was partially due to a full year of rate increases  which went into effect in maryland operations rates became effective during december and interim rates were in effect during june of for delaware operations 
in addition  colder temperatures contributed to the increase in deliveries to residential and commercial customers located in chesapeakes northern service territory 
the  increase in operations expenses was primarily the result of higher compensation  benefits  data processing costs  bad debts and regulatory expenses 
plant additions placed in service during resulted in higher depreciation expense 
in addition  other taxes increased by  or  partially due to the inclusion of certain state revenue related taxes  which were previously included as reductions to revenue 
gross margin summary in thousands increase increase for the years ended december  decrease decrease revenues gas sold       gas transported     gas marketed      other total revenues       cost of sales gas sold       gas marketed      total cost of sales       gross margin gas sold      gas transported     gas marketed other total gross margin      transportation service does not have an associated cost of sales 
natural gas transmission the companys natural gas transmission segment  eastern shore  which became an open access pipeline on november   had an increase in ebit of million for the rise in ebit is partially attributable to a rate increase and an increase in firm services implemented in  as well as an overall reduction in expenses 
the rate increase is designed to generate additional gross margin of approximately million annually 
also contributing to the increase in ebit were additional revenues generated by the increase in transportation services that were effective with the implementation of open access 
on an annual basis  the additional services will generate revenue of approximately million 
operations expense decreased by  or  primarily consisting of compensation  relocation costs and property insurance 
maintenance expenses were also lower due to reduced maintenance required during the year on the gas pipeline system 
capital additions during the year resulted in higher depreciation expense 
the million reduction in ebit was primarily due to lower gross margin on sales to industrial customers 
the gross margin decreased due to a reduction in volumes delivered  primarily reflecting lower deliveries to two industrial interruptible customers a municipal power plant and a methanol plant 
the methanol plant shut down operations on april  during and  deliveries to the methanol and power plants contributed approximately  and million  respectively to gross margin 
as interruptible customers  they had no ongoing commitment  contractual or otherwise  to purchase natural gas from the company see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the  increase in operating expenses reflects increased compensation and benefit related expenses 
depreciation increased due to plant placed in service 
with eastern shores conversion to open access  all of its customers will have the opportunity to transport gas over its system at rates regulated by the ferc 
the variability in eastern shores margins  historically driven by the sales to industrial customers  will dramatically decrease  as capacity reservation fees for transportation services will drive prospective margins 
it is expected that in the future  eastern shores ebit will tend to be more stable and resemble a fully regulated return 
taking the rate increase  revenues associated with additional capacity and lower margins on services provided to industrial customers into account  the company expects gross margin during to be between and million see cautionary statement 
comparatively  gross margin for the past three years has been million  million and million for  and  respectively 
propane distribution in  chesapeake integrated the operations of tri county and the companys existing propane distribution operations 
like chesapeakes existing propane operations  tri countys earnings are heavily dependent upon weather conditions 
the reduction in ebit of million was primarily due to a reduction in gross margin  partially offset by a reduction in expenses 
gross margin decreased due to an reduction in sales volumes coupled with a lower margin per gallon sold 
the decline in sales volumes is directly related to the warmer temperatures  which averaged warmer than the prior year 
furthermore  during the first quarter of temperatures were warmer than normal 
the company normally sells a high percentage of its annual volume during this period 
the reduction in margin per gallon sold was also the result of abnormally warmer temperatures 
as temperatures warmed during the first quarter  demand decreased and supply prices declined rapidly 
due to the low cost of wholesale supply  retail prices declined  thereby reducing margins 
operations expenses decreased  or primarily in the areas of compensation  delivery related costs  advertising and legal fees 
maintenance expenses declined primarily in equipment and structures 
depreciation and amortization expenses declined  or primarily the result of a non compete agreement  which became fully amortized in november of the increase in ebit of  is primarily attributable to a rise in gross margin partially offset by higher expenses 
gross margin was higher due to a increase in volumes sold and a slight increase in margin earned per gallon sold 
the increases are directly related to temperatures which were colder than those in operating expenses increased million or in primarily due to compensation  delivery related costs  benefits and outside services 
maintenance expenses increased in the areas of propane storage facilities  equipment and structures 
advanced information services the results of the advanced information services segment consisted primarily of those of united systems  inc usi  due to the downsizing of chesapeakes north carolina operations in early although the ebit contribution of this segment has remained unchanged from to  usis gross margin has increased by  or 
operating expenses increased due to the opening of a new office in detroit  michigan and the expansion of staff training and marketing efforts to position usi to be able to provide new services and for future growth of current services 
since the rise in operating costs offset most of the growth in gross margin  ebit remained constant 
although the ebit contributed by the advanced information segment was relatively unchanged from to  ebit contributed by usi increased  this was mostly offset by a reduction in ebit contributed by the north carolina operation as they ceased to provide facilities management services beginning in early income taxes operating income taxes in decreased  due to a reduction in ebit 
this was partially offset by the one time expense of  recorded in to establish the deferred income tax liability for tri county 
prior to  tri county was a subchapter s corporation for income tax reporting  therefore  no deferred income taxes were recorded on its balance sheet 
in addition  the companys and restated financial statements do not include any income tax expense for tri county due to its subchapter s status during those years 
other non operating income was   and  for  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to a reduction in interest income  partially offset by the gain on the sale of fixed assets 
the increase in is primarily the result of a rise in interest income earned partially offset by a reduction in the gain on sales of fixed assets 
environmental matters the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at several former gas manufacturing plant sites see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that any future costs associated with these sites will be recoverable in rates 
the year chesapeake is dependent upon information systems to operate efficiently and effectively 
in order to address the impact of the year on its many information systems  chesapeake is in the process of evaluating and remediating any deficiencies 
the company has segregated the evaluation of its readiness and the potential impact of the year on its systems into two components primary internal applications and other applications 
the companys primary applications include systems for its financial information  natural gas customer information and billing  and propane customer information  billing and delivery 
other applications include systems for services such as telephone  system control and data acquisition for the pipeline  as well as other vendors systems 
with respect to the three primary applications  chesapeake has updated its propane customer information  billing and delivery system to a year compliant version 
this system will be tested further to insure compliance during with respect to the other two primary applications  chesapeake has conducted initial evaluations and estimates that the cost of any remediation will not be significant 
each application will be tested during chesapeake has developed an inventory of other applications and is in the process of developing plans to contact its vendors  test and remediate to the extent necessary 
competition historically  the companys natural gas operations have successfully competed with other forms of energy such as electricity  oil and propane 
the principle considerations have been price  and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
as a result of eastern shores recent conversion to open access  the company expects to be subject to competitive pressures from other sellers of natural gas 
with open access transportation services available on eastern shores system  third party suppliers will compete with chesapeake to sell gas to the local distribution companies and the end users on eastern shores system 
eastern shore has shifted from providing sales service to providing transportation and contract storage services 
the companys distribution operations located in delaware began to offer transportation services to certain industrial customers in december chesapeake expects that during  the distribution operations located in maryland will also begin offering transportation services 
the company expects to expand the availability of transportation services to additional customers in the future 
since the florida distribution operations have been open to certain industrial customers since  the company has gained experience in operating in an open access environment 
the company established a natural gas brokering and supplies operation in florida to compete for these customers 
the company is evaluating whether to establish similar services in our northern service territory 
both the propane distribution and the advanced information services businesses face significant competition from a number of larger competitors with substantially greater resources available to them than those of the company 
in addition  in the advanced information services business  changes are occurring rapidly  which could adversely affect the markets for the companys services 
inflation inflation affects the cost of labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
the impact of inflation has lessened in recent years  except for the effect on purchased gas costs 
these costs are passed on to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause in the companys tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operations while monitoring the returns of its unregulated business operations 
cautionary statement statements made herein and elsewhere in this form k  which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  chesapeake is providing the following cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein or otherwise by or on behalf of the company 
a number of factors and uncertainties make it difficult to predict the effect on future operating results of eastern shore operating as an open access pipeline  relative to historical results 
while open access eliminates industrial interruptible sales margins  such sales have varied widely from year to year and  in future years  might have made a less significant contribution to earnings even in the absence of open access 
additionally  there are a number of uncertainties  including future open access proceedings and the effects of competition  which will affect whether the company will be able to provide economical gas marketing  transportation and other services 
in addition  a number of factors and uncertainties affecting other aspects of the companys business could have a material impact on earnings 
these include the seasonality and temperature sensitivity of chesapeakes natural gas and propane businesses  the relative price of alternative energy sources and the effects of competition on both unregulated and natural gas sales  now that the company operates in an open access environment 
there are also uncertainties relative to the impact of the year on the information systems of the company  its vendors and other third parties
