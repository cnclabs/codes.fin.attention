net interest income net interest income for was million  an increase from million recorded in and the million recorded in the primary reason for the yearly increase has been the consistent growth in loans 
see consolidated average balance sheets on pages and and rate volume analysis on page the interest margin  was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent and percent for the years and  respectively 
the slight decrease in the net interest margin from a year ago is reflective of higher deposit costs and interest expense related to the million trust preferred capital securities issued in early  see note i borrowed funds on page the net interest margin increased in from due to higher loan volumes and lower deposit costs 
net interest spread for decreased basis points to percent 
this decrease is largely the result of the million trust preferred capital securities 
net interest spread was percent and percent for and  respectively 
the increase in net interest spread for is primarily due to the corporation s ability to maintain its earnings on funds with higher loan volumes and the favorable impact of the acquisitions  while deposit costs decreased 
the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin could be impacted by future changes in short and long term interest rate levels 
interest rate sensitivity the corporation s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored by its asset liability management committee on an ongoing basis 
the committee seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maintain consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
as the accompanying table indicates  the corporation is liability sensitive  on a cumulative basis  at time periods of one year or less 
the corporation continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the corporation s objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
december  immediately non rate rate sensitive rate sensitive within sensitive cumulative interest rate sensitivity period end balance days days one year five years five years total earning assets loans       securities       federal funds sold and other short term investments      total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities savings and interest on checking      money market deposit accounts      certificates of deposit and other time accounts       federal funds purchased and other borrowings       total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       ratio of earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 


in developing the classifications used for this analysis  it was necessary to make certain assumptions and approximations in assigning assets and liabilities to different maturity categories 
for example  savings and interest on checking are subject to immediate withdrawal and as such are presented as repricing within the earliest period presented even though their balances have historically not shown significant sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
loans are included net of unearned discount of  consumer loans are distributed in the immediately rate sensitive category for those tied to market rates or to other categories according to the repayment schedule 
the above table does not reflect interest rate swaps floors further discussed on page the corporation utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present at the end of each month 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest income and net income over the ensuing month period 
the model was used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing ratably basis points over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
the resulting model simulations show that a basis point increase in rates will result in a positive variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months  while a decrease of basis points will result in a negative variance in net interest income of percent 
liquidity asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  short term investments in time deposits in banks  federal funds sold and securities available for sale 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources which include core depositors and correspondent banks in the corporation s natural trade area which maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to subsidiary banks of the corporation  as well as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements from upstream banks 
non interest income non interest income of  was reported for  compared with  for and  for excluding securities transactions  total non interest income increased percent from the non interest income growth in was favorably impacted by the acquisition of corpus christi bancshares  inc  in the first quarter of the non interest income growth in was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of sbt bancshares  inc and park national bank  in the first quarter of year ended december percent percent percent non interest income amount change amount change amount change trust fees    service charges on deposit accounts    other service charges  collection and exchange charges  commissions and fees    net gain loss on securities transactions  other    total    trust income was up million or percent during as the market value of trust assets increased to billion from billion last year primarily due to the increase in the number of accounts held and trust asset growth resulting from the continued improvement in the stock and bond market 
the december  trust assets were comprised of discretionary assets of billion and non discretionary assets of billion compared to billion and billion last year  respectively 
the million or percent increase in trust income from to is attributable to the increase in the number of accounts held and trust asset growth resulting from improvement in the stock and bond market 
this increase was offset by lower corporate trust income resulting from the sale of the corporation s corporate trust business in deposit service charges increased million or percent from the increase is due mainly to higher service charges related to commercial deposits  volumes processed for correspondent banks and overdraft charges 
deposit service charges increased million or percent from the increase was due mainly to higher volumes  primarily processing for correspondent banks  and service charges on corporate and retail deposits 
other service charges and fees increased million or percent when compared to this increase was primarily due to higher fees from accounts receivable factoring  asset based lending and mutual fund fees offset by lower bankcard discounts resulting from the corporation s outsourcing of its bankcard processing operations which was completed in may the outsourcing of bankcard processing also accounted for the decrease of percent in other service charges from to during the fourth quarter of  the corporation sold a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio resulting in a gain of  this compares to a  and million loss in and  respectively  which resulted primarily from the corporation restructuring a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio by replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of other non interest income increased  or percent to  in compared to a percent decrease in the increase in is primarily due to gains recorded on the sale of student loans  mineral interest income and visa check card fees 
these increases were offset by higher gains on the disposition of certain loans and foreclosed assets recorded by the corporation in the decrease in from was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the corporation s corporate trust business in non interest expense non interest expense was  for compared with  for and  for the acquisition of corpus christi bancshares in the first quarter of impacted the growth in expenses and contributed to the variances from discussed below

salaries and wages increased by million or percent during primarily because of the acquisitions 
pension and other employee benefits increased by million or percent during primarily due to the impact of the acquisition on payroll taxes and medical insurance expense offset by lower contributions to fund the employer match on the employee related stock plans due to the use of forfeited shares 
the percent increase in pension and other employee benefits from to was primarily due to higher retirement plan expense  payroll taxes  and medical insurance expense related to the acquisitions and the impact of an early retirement charge 
net occupancy of banking premises increased  or percent during primarily due to higher building maintenance costs  property taxes and operating expenses  partially offset by higher tenant income 
the percent increase in compared to was primarily due to higher lease  building maintenance  and property tax expense related to the acquisitions 
furniture and equipment costs increased  or percent in primarily due to higher equipment rental and software related expenses 
the  increase in is mostly due to higher depreciation expense associated with the acquisitions 
intangible amortization increased by  or percent and by million or percent in and  respectively  due to the acquisitions 
other non interest expense increased million or percent during primarily due to expenses related to the year compliance program  see year on page  and higher operating expenses  such as  sales promotion  guard services  supplies  travel and telephone  which were impacted by the acquisitions 
other non interest expense was down percent in mostly due to lower fdic insurance  franchise taxes  and federal reserve service charges 
the corporation paid  in fdic insurance premiums in primarily relating to the premium imposed on all banks to service the financing corporation fico bonds compared to a minimal amount in and million in for  the fdic board reduced the insurance premiums to zero for banks in the lowest risk category 
however  legislation enacted in provided for assessments on banks based on deposit levels to pay interest on fico bonds  the proceeds of which were used in the bailout of the savings and loan industry in the s 
for each of the three years beginning in  the assessment on banks will be approximately cents for each of qualified deposits 
for the second half of  the fdic assessment rate imposed on banks ranged from cents for each of domestic deposits for well capitalized banks in the highest of three supervisory rating categories to cents for inadequately capitalized banks in the lowest of the three supervisory rating categories 
this was a decrease from the previous assessment range of cents to cents for those respective categories  for each of domestic deposits 
the corporation s efficiency ratio of percent for improved from percent for and percent for excluding intangible amortization  the efficiency ratio was percent for  an improvement from the percent for and percent for the efficiency ratio measures what percentage of bank revenue is absorbed by non interest expense 
year the corporation s year compliance program includes modifying or replacing appropriate hardware and software utilized by the corporation 
currently  the corporation estimates that the dollar amount to be spent on incremental outside costs to remediate its year issues will be approximately million over a three year period beginning in  funded out of its earnings 
these costs are being expensed as incurred and were approximately  for the year the cost of compliance and expected completion dates are based upon management s best estimates which were derived utilizing assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party vendor remediation plans and other factors 
management expects all mission critical systems to be installed and certified by november and believes that its program is producing the appropriate level of preparedness 
regardless of the year compliance of the corporation s systems  there is no complete assurance that the corporation will not be adversely affected to the extent other entities not affiliated with the corporation are unsuccessful in properly addressing this issue 
in an effort to minimize this possibility  active communication has been on going between the corporation and its external service providers and intermediaries 
in addition  a risk reduction program was initiated in that addresses potential year exposure in the loan portfolio 
public awareness sessions have been hosted by the corporation for customers and suppliers in our marketplace during  and such communication is planned to continue throughout income taxes the corporation recognized income tax expense of  in  compared to  in  and  in the effective tax rate in was percent compared to percent in and percent in for a detailed analysis of the corporation s income taxes see note o income taxes on page cash earnings historically  the corporation s acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting which results in the creation of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are deducted from capital in the determination of regulatory capital 
thus  cash or tangible earnings represents the regulatory capital generated during the year and can be viewed as net income excluding intangible amortization  net of tax 
while the definition of cash or tangible earnings may vary by company  we believe this definition is appropriate as it measures the per share growth of regulatory capital  which impacts the amount available for dividends and acquisitions

during  the amount of interest income actually recorded on non accrual and restructured loans was  loans days past due include  in foreign loans 
loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non accrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
all non consumer loans days or more past due are classified as non accrual unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest income is not recognized until collected  and any previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed 
restructured loans have been modified as to original terms  resulting in a reduction or deferral of principal and or interest as a concession to the debtor 
classification of an asset in the non performing category does not preclude ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
at december   the corporation had  in loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties which had not been included in either of the non accrual  restructured or days past due loan categories 
management monitors such loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis

allowance for possible loan losses as a percentage of year end loans  net of unearned discount there were no foreign charge offs in the corporation has certain lending policies and procedures in place which are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk 
these policies and procedures  some of which are described below  are reviewed regularly by senior management 
a reporting system supplements this review process by providing management and the board of directors with frequent reports related to loan production  loan quality  concentrations of credit  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans vary from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
these loans are underwritten focusing on evaluating and understanding management s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand their business 
once it is determined management possess sound ethics and solid business acumen  current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability to repay their obligations as agreed upon 
in addition  collateral must be of good quality and single purpose projects are avoided 
underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with appropriate collateral margins 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 
at december   the corporation had no concentration of commercial and industrial loans in any single industry that exceeded percent of total loans 
the diversity of the commercial real estate portfolio allows the corporation to reduce the impact of a decline in a single market or industry 
in addition to monitoring and evaluating commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography and risk grade criteria  management closely tracks its level of owner occupied commercial real estate loans versus non owner occupied loans 
additionally  the corporation utilizes the knowledge of third party experts to provide insight and guidance about the economic conditions and dynamics of the markets served by the corporation 
within the commercial real estate loan category  the corporation s primary focus has been the growth of loans secured by owner occupied properties 
at december   a majority of the corporation s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner occupied properties 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
consequently  these loans must withstand the analysis of a commercial loan and the underwriting process of a commercial real estate loan 
loans secured by non owner occupied commercial real estate are made to developers and builders who have a relationship with the corporation and who have a proven record of success 
these loans are underwritten through the use of feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the corporation 
these loans are closely monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than the other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and the availability of long term financing 
the consumer loan portfolio has three distinct segments indirect consumer loans  which represent percent of the consumer loan portfolio  direct non real estate consumer loans  which represent percent of the portfolio and direct real estate consumer loans  which represent percent 
the indirect segment is composed almost exclusively of new and used automobile financing 
non real estate direct loans include automobile loans  unsecured revolving credit products  personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents  and other similar types of credit facilities 
the direct real estate loans are primarily extended for home improvement purposes and residential lot financing for future homesteads 
in addition  on november   texas voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing for the existence of home equity loans in the state of texas 
effective january   the corporation began offering home equity loans up to percent of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower less the balances on existing mortgage and home improvement loans 
home equity loans will be offered for a variety of purposes including education  business start ups  debt consolidation and automobile financing 
it is anticipated this product will become another distinct segment of the consumer portfolio before the end of the year 
primary growth of this product is expected to be from existing customers 
underwriting standards for this product are heavily influenced by the statute requirements  which include but are not limited to  maximum loan to value percentage  collection remedies  the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements 
a computer based credit scoring analysis is used to supplement the consumer loan underwriting process 
to monitor and manage consumer loan risk  policies and procedures are developed and modified  as needed  jointly by line and staff personnel 
this activity  coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers  minimizes the risk 
additionally  trend and outlook reports are provided to senior management on a frequent basis to aid in planning 
the corporation has an independent loan review division that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to senior management and the board of directors 
loan review s function complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as the corporation s policies and procedures 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners are charged off 
furthermore  consumer loan accounts are charged off automatically based on regulatory requirements 
an allowance for possible loan losses is maintained in an amount which  in management s judgment  provides an adequate reserve to absorb possible loan losses 
industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  the impact of rising interest rates  experience level and effectiveness of employees  economic  competitive  political and regulatory conditions and other pertinent factors are all considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
an audit committee of non management directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses quarterly

securities available for sale totaled  at december   compared to  at year end these securities consist primarily of us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies 
the remaining securities  consisting primarily of us government agency obligations  are classified as securities held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity

total    average yield earned during the year taxable equivalent basis interest rate swaps floors during  the corporation continued its strategy of entering into off balance sheet interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk by essentially converting fixed rate loans into synthetic variable rate instruments 
these swap transactions allow management to structure the interest rate sensitivity of the asset side of the corporation s balance sheet to more closely match their view of the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s funding sources 
the corporation had interest rate swaps at december  compared to interest rate swaps at december  each swap was a hedge against a specific commercial fixed rate loan or against a specific pool of consumer fixed rate loans  with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
in each case  the amortization of the interest rate swap generally matches the expected amortization of the underlying loan or pool of loans and was a hedge against either a specific commercial loan or a specific pool of consumer loans with lives ranging from two to ten years 
each counterparty to a swap transaction has a credit rating that is investment grade 
the net amount payable or receivable under these interest rate swap contracts is accrued as an adjustment to interest income and was not considered material in and during  the corporation entered into three interest rate floor agreements with a notional amount totaling million for three years 
the interest rate floors were intended to hedge floating interest rate exposure in commercial loan accounts in an environment of falling interest rates 
deposits total average demand deposits increased percent from this can be attributed to an increase in commercial and individual and correspondent bank deposit levels of million and million  respectively

the increase in the net funds position in is a direct result of the corporation s use of funds acquired from the issuance of the million trust preferred capital securities

there were no borrowings outstanding from this source at december  and guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in corporation s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures during february  the corporation issued million of its percent capital securities  series a which represent a beneficial interest in cullen frost capital trust i  a delaware statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation 
the issuer trust used the proceeds of the sale of the capital securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures of cullen frost 
of these proceeds  the corporation used million for the acquisition of harrisburg bancshares  inc and million for the repurchase of shares of the corporation 
the million trust preferred capital securities are included in the tier capital of cullen frost for regulatory capital purposes and are reported as debt on the balance sheet 
see note i borrowed funds on page capital at december   shareholders equity reached the highest level in the corporation s history   an increase of percent from  at december  the increase in was due primarily to earnings growth partially offset by million of dividends paid and million paid for the repurchase of shares of the corporation 
the corporation had an unrealized gain on securities available for sale  net of deferred taxes  of million as of december  compared to million as of december  currently  under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale is not included in the calculation of risk based capital and leverage ratios 
the corporation paid a quarterly dividend of
