all operations of the discontinued apparel companies have been terminated 
all losses and obligations of these apparel operations have been provided for  and accordingly  the company does not anticipate using any significant portion of its resources towards these discontinued apparel operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company commenced discussions with its factor to convert the amounts due to the factor from the company s discontinued us apparel operations to a term loan 
this new term loan was finalized in september  under the terms of the new lending arrangement  the loan amortization is based on a month period with payments commencing in october with a final balloon payment due september the loan has an interest rate of prime rate plus 
under the company s factoring arrangement for its discontinued apparel operations  the company has provided a standby letter of credit as security for its guaranty under this lending facility  collateralized by marketable securities

the company s existing capital resources  including its bank credit facilities  and its cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to cover the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future

inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends despite continued profitability in its continuing operations in  the company continues to face a difficult business environment with continuing pressure on the company s prices for its sole source sales and a general reduction in the level of funding the defense sector 
based on current delivery schedules and as a result of the acquisition of behlman  however  revenues for the company should be sustained at the levels recorded in the company continues to seek new contracts which require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and preproduction costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by the us government for such effort 
in addition  even if the us government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun which may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and preproduction stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
world events have led the us government to reevaluate the level of military spending for national security 
any significant reductions in the level of military spending by the us government could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives the company some diversity 
in december  the company retained oem capital corp oem  an investment banking firm specializing in the electronics  communications and computer industries  to assist the company in identifying viable acquisition opportunities 
although the company is committed to enhancing its sales and profitability through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth  there is no guarantee that oem will present acquisition candidates that will ultimately result in a transaction for the company 
the company has developed a plan to modify its information technology systems to recognize the year  including the purchase of a new manufacturing software package  and has begun converting its critical data processing systems

the company does not expect this project to have a material effect on its operations in and did not expend any significant amount of money on this project for the year ended december  the company has also initiated discussions with its significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to ensure that these parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with company systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should these organizations fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
while the company intends to use diligent efforts and care to implement the plan set forth above and to take any other necessary steps with regard to its information technology systems to prepare for the year  there is no assurance that such steps will effectively accomplish such goal 
furthermore  any failure on the part of the company s primary suppliers  service providers and customers to adapt their respective information technology systems to recognize the year could adversely impact the company
