consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and the anticipation of positive underwriting results 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include both brokerage commissions and premium taxes which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
such costs have generally changed in proportion with changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
the company maintains a conservative policy for establishing reserves  especially in the year a policy is written 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
as compared to the company s net premiums earned decreased by in as compared to the decrease in premiums earned occurred in all major lines of business 
inland marine premiums recorded the largest percentage decline at in the company decided in the prior year to withdraw from writing property risks of the larger assureds with multiple locations after years of unprofitable results brought about mainly by large catastrophe losses 
in  the company concentrated on writing risks that are ancillary to its ocean marine risks 
this strategy is expected to remain in place for ocean marine premiums earned fell by in mainly due to falling premium rates as competition remained intense during the year 
all classes within the ocean marine line experienced declines except for the energy class which saw increases in production 
net premium writings did not decline at the same rate as gross premiums primarily due to lower reinsurance costs 
competition should remain intense in the company has been writing additional marine liability accounts with assureds that have smaller amounts of exposure 
this area of growth may offset expected rate reductions 
a source of additional growth in in this line will be from premiums written through our recently acquired agency and syndicate in lloyd s of london 
although net premiums earned in the aviation decreased by only  gross written and net written premiums decreased by and  respectively 
a softening of rates in the aviation line  resulting from excess industry capacity  initially started in and continued into and accounted for a reduction in gross aviation premiums written in the current year 
during soft underwriting cycles  the company seeks to reduce overall retention levels in order to avoid the negative impact of any one loss on net income 
as a consequence of purchasing additional reinsurance  net writings fell at a greater percentage 
the company expects this environment to remain competitive in other liability earned premiums decreased by 
the casualty market has been severely competitive for many years 
consequently  the company continues to underwrite this line very selectively 
the company expects the casualty market to remain competitive in with premiums likely to further decline 
premiums earned did benefit  however  from the company s increased pool participation in the mutual marine office  inc ocean marine and aviation pool from to effective for policies incepting on or after january  losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in as compared to in improved net loss experience in the other liability and inland lines contributed to the overall decline in the loss ratios
