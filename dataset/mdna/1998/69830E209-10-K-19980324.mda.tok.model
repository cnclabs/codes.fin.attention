upon consummation of the proposed recapitalization  the net proceeds from such offering will be transferred to the company and the obligations of px escrow corp

the non controlling partners consisted of members of the bank group that provided pilp s prior credit facility and were not otherwise affiliated with the company  pilp or warburg  pincus

the recapitalization was financed by i borrowings of million under a new credit facility  ii funds from working capital and iii loans from warburg  pincus and management 
the loans consisted of subordinated demand notes of    and  issued to warburg  pincus and messrs 
scott  farrand and marcketta  respectively 
these notes were repaid subsequent to the initial public offering 
in addition  effective july   warburg contributed substantially all of the assets of lee lighting to the company as a capital contribution in the amount of million and made an additional capital contribution of million in cash 
prior to the recapitalization  the non controlling partners owned of the non voting class a and of the voting class b limited partnership units

in  and  as pilp generated earnings before the non controlling partners interest  a portion of their interest in those earnings was allocated to the company s capital account to restore the proportionate amount of the non controlling partners deficits and distributions for taxes previously charged to the company s capital account

however  following the successful completion of the proposed recapitalization  as more fully described in the beginning of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company will become highly leveraged which will likely have a significant impact on its future liquidity 
seasonality the company s revenue and net income are subject to seasonal fluctuations experienced primarily in the first and second calendar quarters 
feature film and commercial production activity typically reaches its peak in the third and fourth quarters 
in north america  episodic television programs cease filming in the second quarter for several months  and typically resume production in august 
impact of inflation the company s results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to measure accurately the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  the company believes that the effects of inflation  if any  on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  accordingly  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal activities 
the company has commenced its process for reviewing its worldwide operations for compliance with the year problem 
based upon this preliminary review  internal systems either are  or are anticipated to be  in compliance 
although the company has commenced the process of inquiring of outside vendors whether or not they will also be year compliant  the company has not been able to determine precisely the impact  if any  on its operations if outside vendors fail to comply with the year requirements 
in the event that the company s internal systems or systems of significant outside vendors are not converted or modified in a timely manner to make them year compliant  there could be a material adverse effect upon the business and financial results of the company 
the overall anticipated cost of year compliance for the internal systems of the company is not expected to be material 
forward looking statement certain plans  objectives  projections and other information regarding future performance and outcomes discussed in this form k are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that these future results will be achieved 
potential risk and uncertainty which could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain these results include  without limitation  the following factors o significant reduction in the total number of feature films produced o competitive pressures arising from changes in technology  customer requirements and industry standards o an increase in expenses related to new product initiatives and product development efforts o unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations o significant increases in interest rates
