these tractors are scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of and are expected to be financed from available cash and investments 
a substantial portion of the capital required for upac s insurance premium finance operations has been provided through the sale of undivided interests in a designated pool of receivables on an ongoing basis under receivables securitization agreements  as well as  from the date of the acquisition of upac through december   secured borrowings against upac s receivables 
the current securitization agreement which matures december  currently provides for the sale of a maximum of million of eligible receivables

see note to the consolidated financial statements financing agreements 
through december   the company contributed  to presis   of which has been capitalized in operating equipment and intangibles

both lines are secured by the crouse s revenue equipment and bank deposit balances 
the secured loan agreement replaced a revolving credit agreement which provided for borrowings up to million bearing interest at the bank s prime rate  at december  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were secured by crouse s revenue equipment 
in through  crouse has utilized this agreement only on a limited basis for short term operational needs

six of these facilities maintain underground fuel storage tanks 
old tanks and piping at five of the six facilities were replaced and upgraded with tanks equipped with corrosion protection and automatic tank monitoring equipment between and any contamination detected during the tank replacement process at these sites was remediated at the same time 
the cost of replacing and upgrading tanks and remediating contamination  if any was detected  was not material to the financial position of the company 
the sixth facility was acquired in testing of the site as a condition of purchase did not detect any contamination  however  the company expects to replace the existing underground tanks with new tanks and piping equipped with corrosion protection and automatic tank monitoring before the end of the cost of this replacement and any potential remediation is not expected to be material 
the company is not currently under any requirement to incur mandated expenditures to remediate previously contaminated sites and does not anticipate any material costs for other infrequent or non recurring clean up expenditures 
crouse retains a  per occurrence self insured exposure  or deductible  on its workers compensation  general and automobile liability  bodily injury and property damage and cargo damage insurance coverages 
the company maintains reserves for the estimated cost of the self insured portion of claims based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and the company s past claims experience 
there have been no material adverse trends involving the differences in claims experience versus claims estimates on any of the above categories of self insured risks 
based upon management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and the company s past claims experience  management believes accrued reserves are adequate for its self insured exposures as of december  the amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic not less than quarterly evaluations of the portfolios based on historical loss experience  detail account by account agings of the portfolios and management s evaluation of specific accounts 
management believes the allowances for credit losses are adequate to provide for potential losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies allowance for credit losses 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to represent years rather than four digits  which include the century designation 
without corrective action  it is possible that the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year in some systems this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has performed preliminary assessments of the potential impact of the year issue on the data processing systems of its financial services and transportation operations 
during  the database engine for the pc based finance system was upgraded to a year compliant version and the related databases and programs were modified by internal personnel to properly handle year dates 
testing performed to date of these modifications has been successful 
as crouse implemented its new data processing system during  databases were modified to allow for the century designation and certain common date programs were identified 
during  the company plans to upgrade its operating system to a year compliant version and to make and test the necessary modifications to its common date programs using available personnel 
the costs incurred in for the assessment of the issue  upgrades in third party software and modification and testing of the company s computer systems did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
management s best current estimates of the remaining costs to be incurred  which are based on assumptions of future events  including  without limitation  the continued availability of resources  third party modification plans and other factors  such future costs should not be material to the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant vendors to determine the extent to which its operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
additional testing of data exchanges with certain vendors will be performed in as such vendors complete their systems modifications 
there can be no assurance  however  that the systems of other companies with which the company interacts will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  liquidity or results of operations of the company
