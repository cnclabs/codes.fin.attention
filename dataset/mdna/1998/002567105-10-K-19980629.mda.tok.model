item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview abaxis  inc the company develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
the company s products consist of a compact kilogram analyzer and a series of single use plastic disks called reagent discs that contain all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests 
the system can be operated with minimal training and performs multiple routine tests on whole blood  serum or plasma using either venous or fingerstick samples 
the system provides test results in less than minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory 
the company currently markets this system for veterinary use under the name vetscan and in the human medical market under the name piccolo 
during the year ended march   the company achieved record results in terms of revenues and unit sales  placing  point of care blood chemistry analyzers worldwide a increase from fiscal shipments of point of care blood chemistry analyzers  of which were vetscan systems and were piccolo systems 
reagent discs shipped during fiscal were approximately  an increase of compared to fiscal shipments of approximately  reagent discs 
ninety four percent of these reagent disc shipments were for veterinary applications 
the increase in reagent disc shipments during fiscal is consistent with the company s belief that there will be recurring reagent disc revenue as the company s product lines mature 
this growth is mostly attributable to the expanded installed base of vetscan systems and higher consumption rates of institutional users 
there can be no assurance growth in revenues or unit sales will continue or that the company will be able to increase production to meet increased product demand 
in fiscal  the company s us product sales accounted for of its total revenues  international sales accounted for and orbos contract revenue accounted for the remaining 
eighty one percent of the sales in the us were to the veterinary market and were to the human medical market 
sales to the us navy and marines pursuant to a contract awarded in march totaled piccolo systems which accounted for essentially all of the human medical market sales 
through fiscal  the company has shipped approximately of the maximum number of analyzers covered by the contract with the us navy 
there can be no assurances that the us navy will place purchase orders against the balance of the contract 
internationally  sales to japan constituted and sales to europe constituted of the total international shipments during fiscal in july  the japanese ministry of agriculture  forestry and fishery nosuisho approved sales of vetscan systems to the approximate  veterinary practices in japan 
this approval resulted in the company placing vetscan systems in japan during fiscal there can be no assurance that the increases in japanese sales will continue 
the company also shipped during fiscal an initial order of piccolo systems for use by the instituto mexicano del securo social imss 
these units were installed in rural clinics throughout mexico 
on june   the company announced that it had signed an exclusive distribution agreement with genzyme virotech for distribution of the company s products in germany 
the agreement included both the vetscan and piccolo systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will receive additional orders beyond the terms of current purchase orders from these and other distributors 
through march   the company has placed a total of  units of its point of care blood chemistry analyzer worldwide  of which  were vetscan systems and were piccolo systems 
in north america  the company has placed  vetscan systems and piccolo systems 
internationally outside of north america  the company has placed vetscan systems and piccolo systems 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
the company generally operates with limited order backlog because its products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the company s expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues 
accordingly the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would have an immediate materially adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 
until sales volume of the company s products  particularly its reagent discs  increases significantly so as to offset associated fixed costs and to realize certain manufacturing economies of scale  sales of the company s products will result in further losses and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
the company s periodic operating results have in the past varied and in the future may vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including the level of competition  the size and timing of sales orders  market acceptance of current and new products  new product announcements by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  component costs and supply constraints  manufacturing capacities and ability to scale up production  the mix of product sales between the analyzers and the reagent discs  mix in sales channels  levels of expenditure on research and development  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  regulatory changes  and general economic trends 
the company continues to explore the application of its proprietary technology used to produce the dry reagents used in the reagent discs  called the orbos discrete lyophilization process  to other companies products 
this process allows the production of an accurate  precise amount of active chemical ingredients in the form of a soluble bead 
the company believes that the orbos process has broad applications in products where delivery of active ingredients in a stable  pre metered format is desired 
the company has contracts with becton dickinson immunocytometry systems and pharmacia biotech  inc to either supply products or license orbos technology 
the company is currently working with other companies to determine potential suitability of the orbos technology to these companies products 
as resources permit  the company will pursue other development  licensing or manufacturing agreement opportunities for its orbos technology with other companies 
there can be no assurances  however  that other applications will be identified or that additional agreements with the company will result 
results of operations revenue during fiscal  the company reported total revenues of approximately  a  or increase from fiscal total revenues of approximately  fiscal revenue increased  or from fiscal total revenues of approximately  revenue increases in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased unit sales of vetscan systems in the us  sales of piccolo systems to the us military on a direct basis without any distributor discounts  which yield higher net revenues  sales of piccolo systems to mexico  increased sales of vetscan systems to the japanese market and higher reagent disc sales in the domestic and international markets 
the increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased unit sales of point of care blood chemistry analyzers  direct sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal of piccolo systems to the us military  and increased repeat reagent disc sales in both the us and international markets 
three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  in fiscal year  one customer accounted for of total revenues

research and development activities accounted for of total operating expenses during fiscal as compared to of total operating expenses during fiscal and during fiscal the company expects the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in fiscal from fiscal  as the company completes development and clinical trials of new test methods to expand its test menus as well as other development projects 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will undertake such research and development activities in future periods or  if it does  that such activities will be successful 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  or of total revenues in fiscal  compared to approximately  or of total revenues in fiscal and approximately  or of total revenues in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal of  or is primarily the result of certain non recurring costs associated with the launch of the piccolo product line in fiscal and the company s cost containment efforts in fiscal the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal of  or is related primarily to launching the piccolo products worldwide and increases in administrative  sales and marketing staffing 
selling  general and administrative expense accounted for approximately of total operating expenses during fiscal as compared to of total operating expenses during fiscal and of total operating expenses during fiscal the company expects the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense to increase in fiscal from fiscal  to meet staffing and support demands associated with increased sales 
net interest income net interest income totaled approximately  or of total revenues for fiscal  compared to  or of total revenues in the comparable period of fiscal the company incurred interest expense of approximately  on an equipment loan during fiscal the company incurred no interest expense during fiscal the increase in interest expense was offset by an increase in interest income of approximately  during fiscal compared to interest income during fiscal this increase in interest income was primarily the result of increased investment levels 
interest income totaled  or of total revenues for fiscal  compared with  or of total revenues in fiscal interest income decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of decreased investment levels and a lower rate of return on investments due to shorter terms of the investments 
the company incurred no interest expense during fiscal and liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and  in short term investments  for total cash resources of  the company expects to incur substantial additional costs to support its future operations  including further commercialization of its products and development of new test methods that will allow the company to further penetrate the human diagnostic market  acquisition of capital equipment for the company s manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to continuing development of its current and future products  development and implementation of an automated manufacturing line to provide capacity for commercial volumes  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for its current and future products 
the company is currently contracting with a vendor to build an automated disc assembly line to provide additional capacity and to improve production efficiency 
the company estimates the cost of this new assembly line will be approximately  of which approximately  was paid through march  the company expects to pay the balance upon acceptance of the equipment which is currently scheduled to occur during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  in anticipation of taking delivery of the automated assembly line  the company arranged for an equipment financing loan of up to  the equipment financing loan is collateralized by the company s equipment and bears interest at approximately 
this loan is due on april  as of march   the company has drawn  against this equipment financing loan of which  has been repaid 
the company plans on drawing down the balance of the loan once the new automated assembly line is delivered to its facility 
additional manufacturing equipment will also need to be added during fiscal to provide sufficient production capabilities 
additionally  inventories and receivables related to increased sales levels of the vetscan and piccolo systems could increase significantly in future periods  which would require significant capital resources 
net cash used in operating activities during fiscal  was  compared to  net cash used in operating activities during fiscal  and  net cash used in operating activities fiscal the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a lower net loss  a decrease in inventories and increases in trade and other receivables  accounts payable  and accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities 
net inventories at march   compared to march   were higher due to preparation for shipment against orders from the navy and vetsmart contracts beginning in april increases in trade and other receivables and accounts payable is due to increases in receivable and payable levels associated with revenue growth 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of increases in trade and other receivables due to increased revenue in primarily the fourth quarter of fiscal from the same period in fiscal  increases in inventory necessary to meet production demands for increased shipments and a decrease in trade accounts payable 
the increases in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal were partially offset by increases in liabilities such as accrued payroll  other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  as compared to  net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal and  of net cash used in investing activities in fiscal the change from net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal to net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in purchases of short term investments offset by a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment 
the change from net cash used in fiscal to net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was primarily due to total maturities of available for sale securities exceeding purchases of available for sale securities in fiscal resulting in a decrease of total short term investments 
cash provided by maturities and sales of available for sale securities was partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment over fiscal levels 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  as compared to  net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal and  of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of common and preferred stock of  and net proceeds from equipment financing of  cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of common and preferred stock of  cash provided by financing activities during this period was decreased by a  payment of a preferred stock dividend 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is the result of proceeds from an offshore private placement of common stock 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  debt financing and anticipated revenue from the sales of its products will be adequate to satisfy its currently planned operating and financial requirements through the next twelve months 
the company s future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of its point of care blood chemistry analyzer products 
however  the company s sales are not predictable due to its limited market experience with its products 
in the event the sales are significantly below the anticipated level  the company may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available  and any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  while debt financing may involve restrictive covenants
