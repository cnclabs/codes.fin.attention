as discussed in item business  general  the company suspended flight operations on may  and pursuant to the order resumed limited operations on may  additionally  the company discontinued service as midway connection in the southeast united states and as great lakes airlines in the southwest united states and mexico on may  operating revenues from these two markets decreased to million in from million in the company anticipates that this reduction in service will have a positive impact on profitability since the company s focus will be on its core business 
both midway connection and great lakes airlines in the southwest united states and mexico were operated at a loss 
throughout the remainder of  the company returned all but four of its beech aircraft and two of its brasilia aircraft to service 
as part of the realignment of united s relationships with its united express carriers  the company has been authorized to replace service from denver previously provided by another united express carrier beginning april  this service will be performed with beech aircraft  and represents a significant expansion of the company s current service 
in light of the company s present and planned route structure  the company has determined to reduce the size of its brasilia fleet 
in february the company entered into an agreement with another carrier to sell its ten remaining brasilia aircraft and related spare parts and specialized tooling  and disposed of one brasilia aircraft pursuant to that agreement in march subsequent to the february agreement  management has determined to utilize five brasilia aircraft in its operations and accordingly the company is currently renegotiating the agreement with the other carrier to reduce the number of brasilia aircraft to be sold 
there can be no assurance that any modification to the february agreement will be made 
the company has included a net charge of million in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses for to reflect the financial statement impact of the disposition of those aircraft expected to be sold in if management determines or if the company is required to dispose of additional brasilia aircraft  it is likely that a substantial additional charge to operations would be required 
the company has suffered significant recurring losses and negative cash flows  which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s viability as a going concern depends upon its return to sustained profitability

this expense includes million related to salaries and wages  aircraft maintenance materials and repairs  aircraft ownership costs  facilities rental  and other expenses directly related to the shutdown 
the remaining million for the brasilia aircraft reduction represents a reduction of the carrying value of the aircraft to their estimated net realizable value  accrued estimated future unrecoverable lease payments  accrued estimated lease termination costs  and a reduction of the carrying value of the spare part inventories to net realizable value offset by the recognition of related deferred purchase incentives on these aircraft 
benefit for income taxes no income tax benefit was recorded for considering that the company is in a loss carry forward position and that the realization of any benefits of such are substantially in doubt

operating expenses total operating expenses increased to million  or cents per asm  in from million  or cents per asm in in part  the increase in cost per asm is due to decreased utilization of the embraer aircraft because of two airworthiness directives requiring frequent propeller inspections and lack of replacement propeller blades during the first quarter of the increase of total operating expenses reflect the costs associated with expansion of the company s aircraft fleet and increased level of operations  except as detailed below

these expenses were also increased due to flight cancellations resulting from severe weather conditions in upper midwest and to unanticipated turnover in flight personnel due to major carrier hiring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company accelerated its program to replace its beechcraft c aircraft with d aircraft 
as a consequence  the company believes it has excess beechcraft c inventory and has made an adjustment for million dollars to reduce the inventory to estimated net realizable value 
these increases were partially offset by lower united program fees due to increased flying under the company s own code and insurance proceeds from the november accident

liquidity and capital resources the company has suffered significant recurring losses and negative cash flows  which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has no further availability on its million line of credit with raytheon 
the company is heavily dependent on raytheon and united for its liquidity requirements  however neither raytheon nor united is under any current obligation to provide further financing to the company 
the company s viability as a going concern depends upon its return to sustained profitability 
the company s working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  cash decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the major uses of working capital in were a net loss of million offset by non cash charges for depreciation of million  deferral of lease payments of million and the decrease in accounts receivable  inventories  and prepaid expenses totaling million 
these changes are a result of the company s reduced level of operations in raytheon is the company s primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor 
the company has financed all of its beechcraft aircraft and one of its brasilia aircraft under related lease and debt agreements with raytheon  and raytheon has also provided a million working capital line of credit  collateralized by accounts receivable 
the raytheon agreements went into default in due to the company s non payment of scheduled amounts due 
on july  the company reached an agreement with raytheon pursuant to which raytheon provided a short term loan of million 
this loan  and the million working capital line of credit which were due on july   have been extended until june  the million loan  as well as existing raytheon indebtedness  has been collateralized with all previously unpledged beech aircraft spare parts and equipment and accounts receivable 
in addition  raytheon was granted a warrant for a period of ten years  exercisable commencing july   to purchase one million shares of the company s common stock at a price of 
per share 
in connection with the july  agreement  all defaults under the raytheon agreements were waived 
effective august   the company restructured its raytheon aircraft agreements 
the restructuring resulted in a total of beech aircraft under operating leases of various terms with monthly lease payments ranging from  to  per aircraft and seven beech c airliners remaining as owned aircraft

during  all of the brasilia agreements went into default due to non payment of scheduled amounts due 
all defaults under the brasilia agreements have been cured as of the date of this filing 
two brasilia aircraft  which the company had in its fleet as of january  were returned to the lessor through the exercise of the lessor s rights as a result of the default 
the lease on one of these aircraft has been assigned to another carrier and it is anticipated that the other lease will be assigned in the near future  thereby terminating the lease without a significant expense to the company 
the lease costs associated with these two returned aircraft are included in excess aircraft  shutdown  and other non recurring expenses 
although the company has decreased its accounts payable balance from december   it continues to have past due trade accounts 
notes totaling approximately million have been issued in to certain of the vendors  which  in general  require payment over a one year period 
the balance of these notes was 
million as of december  the company believes that it has reached an appropriate accommodation with its key suppliers and that it will be able to obtain necessary goods and services on acceptable terms as long as timely payment is made for current purchases 
capital expenditures related to aircraft and equipment totaled million in  million during  and million in payment of debt exceeded borrowings by million in long term borrowings exceeded principal repayments by in long term debt  net of current maturities of million  totaled million at december  compared to million net of current maturities of million  at december   and million  net of current maturities of million at december  as a result of the restructuring of the company s raytheon aircraft agreements  long term debt decreased million 
as of december   the term notes bear interest at rates ranging from to percent and are payable monthly or quarterly through july  all long term debt as of december   relates to the acquisition of aircraft and is collateralized by related aircraft 
there are no financial covenants related to such long term debt 
year impact on computers many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in approximately two years  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company has started to review its computer systems and application programs for year compliance 
the company can not give any assurances that the company s systems nor the systems of other parties upon which the company must rely  will be year compliant on a timely basis 
examples of systems operated by others that the company may use and or rely upon are faa air traffic control  computer reservation systems for travel agent sales and united airlines reservation  passenger check in and ticketing systems 
the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems and applications or those operated by others 
seasonality since commencing operations  the company has traditionally experienced lower passenger load factors during the months of january through april  november and december 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations and fewer vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  profitability and cash flow for the company during these months 
frequent flyer program on the company s united express passengers may earn miles in united s mileage plus and frequent flyer program  and passengers may use mileage accumulated in this program to obtain discounted or free tickets for trips that might include a flight segment on one of the company s flights 
no revenues are earned or collected on free tickets awarded to passengers under the program 
awards earned under the frequent flyers program have an expiration date three years from the date earned 
the program also contains certain restrictions  including blackout dates and capacity controlled bookings  which substantially limit the use of awards on certain flights and during the busiest periods 
the company continually monitors the number of free travel award reservations on its flight segments to ensure that they are within the capacity restrictions defined in the mileage plus program 
the company s yield management program and related seat restrictions minimize the number of revenue passengers that may be displaced on any individual flight segment 
to date  the company has not experienced any material use of mileage plus and awards to obtain travel on flights  and the incremental cost to the company attributable to the exercise of frequent flyer awards consisting primarily of a minimal amount of additional gate and passenger service expenses has not been material 
awards used on the company s flights during the year ended december  represented approximately percent of the company s total passengers 
the company expects that this percentage will remain approximately the same for the foreseeable future 
based on this low percentage  on the availability on many of the company s flights of otherwise vacant seats  and on the program s restrictions  the company believes that the displacement  if any  of revenue passengers by users of mileage plus and awards will not become material 
the company continually monitors the number of awards redeemed and will accrue the incremental costs associated with the mileage plus and program if they become material 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations in the past five years 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary factors the company wishes to caution shareholders and prospective investors that the following important factors  among other identified in this annual report on form k  could affect the company s actual operating results  and that such results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
the order in which such factors appear below should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 
dependence on relationship with united the company generated approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  under the united express agreements described under business united express relationship 
the united express agreements required the company to comply with specific operating performance standards and  with certain limited exceptions  restrict the ability of the company to merge with another company or dispose of its assets or aircraft without first offering united a right of first refusal to acquire the company or such assets or aircraft 
the united express agreements also prohibited the company from entering into similar arrangements with other carriers in chicago  denver  minneapolis st 
paul  detroit  des moines or omaha without united s prior approval 
the united express agreements required the company to obtain united s prior consent to operate as a united express carrier in any market  except for certain pre approved markets connecting with minneapolis st 
paul or detroit 
the united express agreements terminated on december  the company believes its relationship with united is satisfactory  as evidenced by united s recent selection of the company as the united express carrier for additional routes serving the denver airport 
since december  the company has been operating as if the day to day operational provisions of the previous code sharing agreement are still effective 
a failure to renew the united express agreements  any termination or materially adverse modification of the agreements  or any substantial decrease in the number of routes served by the company under the agreements would have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
as a result of the united express agreements  the company s business is sensitive to events and risks affecting united 
if adverse events affect united s business  the company s business will also be adversely affected 
effect of general economic conditions the airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions 
during recent recessions  most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase traffic 
economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines 
a worsening of current economic conditions  or an extended period of recession nationally or regionally  would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
fuel costs fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines 
the company s cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions  and the company has no guaranteed long term sources of supply 
the company intends generally to follow industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price increases 
however  the company s ability to pass on increased fuel costs through fare increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions 
accordingly  a reduction in the availability or an increase in the price of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on the company s cash flow from operations and profitability 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced lower passenger load factors during the months of january through april 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations  resulting in fewer vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these season factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the company during these months
