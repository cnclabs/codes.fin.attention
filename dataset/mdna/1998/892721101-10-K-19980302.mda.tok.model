the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund the cost of advertising and promotion 
collections of accounts receivable by the company s entertainment related service providers are remitted net of chargeback reserves 
the company anticipates purchasing equipment in connection with the establishment of in house telemarketing operations and expanding its computer database capabilities 
the company currently has no other plans or material commitments for capital expenditures 
based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations including the substantial costs associated with its advertising and marketing activities  projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources  including  if necessary  its financing arrangements with service providers  will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company does not have any long term obligations and does not intend to incur any such obligations in the future 
as the company seeks to diversify with new telecommunication products and services  the board of directors  may  at its discretion  authorize the use of existing cash reserves  long term financing  or other means to finance such diversification

strategic corporate partnerships during the third quarter of fiscal  at t modified its contact and customer acquisition strategies 
these modifications by at t severely limited the customer base to which the company could market at t s long distance products 
these modifications included changes in the policy regarding selecting prospects based on long distance spending patterns  whereby the spending price point criteria for eligible prospects was raised by at t 
additionally  at t limited the company s marketing efforts by withdrawing from the company s programs potential prospects who had recently been contacted by at t s customer acquisition team 
the policy adjustments  which commenced in late july  were responsible for the company s decrease in at t strategic corporate partnership revenues in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal the company realized at t strategic corporate partnership revenues of  for the year ended november  the fourth quarter of fiscal included  of at t strategic corporate revenues as compared to  in the third quarter   in the second quarter and  in the first quarter of fiscal the company terminated its strategic corporate partnership with at t in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  at t related revenues will be negligible in fiscal the company concluded an agreement with the long distance carrier  lci international telecom corp 
lci  in the first quarter of fiscal the company will provide marketing services to lci  primarily through outbound telemarketing 
these marketing services will be directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for lci 
in addition to commissions paid to the company for its successful customer acquisitions on behalf of lci  the agreement also calls for the company to participate in lci s net revenues earned from such acquired customer s residential long distance usage

to date  the new arrangement has not contributed substantially to the company s income  nor has the arrangement contributed substantially to the assets or liabilities of the company 
increased chargebacks during the fiscal quarters immediately preceding the fiscal quarter ended august   the company received data from one of its entertainment service providers indicating significant decreases in the amount of chargebacks received by the company during such quarters  as compared to the prior comparable quarters 
based upon such information provided by the service provider  the company adjusted the amount of its entertainment related chargeback reserves 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company received further information from such service provider indicating a significant increase in the rate of reported entertainment service chargebacks for the third quarter of fiscal and prior quarters 
the reserves established at the end of the second quarter of fiscal were insufficient to absorb the increase  and as a result  the company has revised its estimates for chargebacks  based on this increased chargeback experience 
the company believes that the chargeback reserves at november  fairly state the future liability for chargebacks on gross revenues recorded to november   based on all currently available information

government regulation all of the company s entertainment services and advertisements are reviewed by the company s regulatory counsel  and management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with all material federal and state laws and regulations governing its provision of and number entertainment services  all of its billing and collection practices and the advertising of its services and has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all licenses and permits necessary to engage in telemarketing activities 
although the company from time to time receives requests for information from  or is forwarded consumer complaints by  regulatory authorities  the company has not been subject to any enforcement actions by any regulatory authority 
nevertheless  during  civil investigative demands were received from the attorneys general of the states of illinois and texas  as well as recent warnings of possible violations from the states of california  connecticut and wisconsin 
the company believes that the information has been sought as part of pending investigations in connection with certain of the company s marketing activities 
the company is in discussions with texas concerning revisions to the company s billing and marketing practices 
during the summer of  the attorney general of the state of new york commenced an investigation of the company s pay per call consumer billing practices by issuing subpoenas for documents  which the company provided 
on or about october   the company submitted to the new york attorney general s office a letter  setting forth its position with respect to the investigation 
to date  the company has not received a response to its letter and there has been no further activity with respect to the investigation 
management believes that  while the investigations will not result in enforcement actions or claims which would have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
amendments to or interpretations and enforcement of existing statutes and regulations  adoption of new statutes and regulations and the company s expansion into new jurisdictions and number services continually require the company to alter methods of operations  modify the content or use of its services or the manner in which it markets it services  which could result in material interruptions in its operations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to civil remedies  including substantial fines  penalties and injunctions  as well as possible criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company

for example  the year was written within such computer program as 
as a result  at the onset of the new millenium  any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
this potential difficulty is commonly referred to as the year problem 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year problem 
the company believes that all of its internal computer programs  software packages  systems and networks are year compliant

notwithstanding the foregoing  the company is reliant on third parties  including the providers of its various services  for the operation of the company s day to day business 
the company can not provide any assurances that the steps being taken by such third parties  if any  will be sufficient to eliminate any year problem from the computer systems used by such third parties and relied upon by the company 
the company has corresponded with such third parties  expressing its concerns about the impact of the year problem on the company s operations 
in the event modifications and conversions to computer systems are required by such third parties and are not completed on a timely basis  the year problem may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company
