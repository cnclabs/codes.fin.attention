item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the consolidated financial statements include regulated utility northwest natural gas company nw natural non regulated wholly owned subsidiaries nng financial corporation financial corporation canor energy  ltd 
canor oregon natural gas development corporation oregon natural merged with and into nw natural during the second quarter of together these businesses are referred to herein as the company see subsidiary operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to the consolidated activities of the company for the three years ended december  earnings and dividends in  the company s earnings applicable to common stock were million  the second highest in the company s history 
earnings in were a record million  up percent from million in the higher earnings reflect both colder weather and customer growth 
earnings for both and were lower due to warmer than normal weather  the effect of which was partially offset by additional sales from customer growth 
the company s basic earnings from consolidated operations were a share in  down from a share in and up from a share in nw natural earned a share from gas utility operations in  compared to in and in weather conditions in nw natural s service territory in were percent warmer than in and percent warmer than the year average 
weather in was percent colder than and percent colder than the year average 
the estimated weather related decrease in net operating revenues margin during was equivalent to about cents a share compared to actual conditions during the colder weather in resulted in increased gas deliveries to  and related margin from  weather sensitive customers 
the weather related increase in was equivalent to about cents a share compared to actual conditions in customer growth of percent during both and contributed an estimated million to margin and million to margin 
customer growth of percent during contributed an estimated million to margin 
the estimated impact on margin of weather and customer growth are derived from nw natural s internal planning model 
the model calculates expected sales to  and revenues from  residential and commercial customers for base usage  representing gas use for water heaters  ranges  and other appliances not sensitive to outside temperatures 
the model also calculates expected sales to  and revenues from  these customers for heat sensitive usage  primarily furnaces  as a function of heating degree days the difference between degrees fahrenheit and the average of a day s high and low temperatures 
the model then estimates the earnings effect of the difference between expected sales and revenues under actual temperature conditions  and expected sales and revenues under average temperature conditions 
subsidiary earnings for were equivalent to cents a share  compared to cents in and cents in the decrease in from was primarily due to a one time million gain in from oregon natural s sale of its underground storage assets to nw natural which was offset in part by an impairment loss of million on producing wells and a million write down of unproven properties 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a one time million gain in from oregon natural s sale of production and related gathering system assets 
was the nd consecutive year in which the company s dividends paid have increased 
dividends paid on common stock were a share in compared with in and in results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing approximately percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined for the most part by continued growth in the residential and commercial markets  and by nw natural s ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain timely regulatory approval for rate changes reflecting investments in new utility plant 
nw natural currently has no competition from other gas utility distributors in the territory it serves 
however  it competes with northwest pipeline corporation npc to serve large industrial customers  with oil and electricity for industrial and commercial uses  and with oil  electricity  and wood for residential use 
the pacific northwest has historically enjoyed some of the lowest electric rates in the nation  primarily due to the proximity of federal hydropower facilities 
with further deregulation of the energy business  the market for energy will become more competitive  but the pacific northwest is unlikely to experience the large drop in electric rates that other  high cost areas of the country are anticipating 
in  nw natural maintained its competitive advantage over electricity and approximate price parity with fuel oil in the residential and commercial markets 
in october  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc approved a general rate increase averaging percent for nw natural s customers in washington 
revenue from washington operations will increase by approximately million annually due to the combined effects of the general rate increase of about million and a temporary surcharge to recover over five years the balance of deferred expense related to retiree health care and life insurance benefits attributable to washington operations 
the wutc authorized a return on common equity of percent 
effective december   the wutc approved a rate increase averaging percent to pass through to washington customers increases in purchased gas costs and to remove temporary rate increments to amortize balances in deferred accounts 
the wutc approved rate decreases averaging percent and percent  respectively  effective december  and effective january   the oregon public utility commission opuc approved rate increases averaging percent for nw natural s customers in oregon 
the opuc also approved a settlement modifying the incentive formula for deferrals of variations in gas costs  from percent to percent 
the opuc approved rate decreases averaging percent and percent effective december  and  respectively 
the rate increases in oregon in and the rate decreases in and reflected changes in nw natural s purchased gas costs  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize regulatory balancing accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
none of the rate increases and decreases discussed above had a material effect on net income 
comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended december thousands except customers and degree days gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales    unbilled volumes    weather sensitive volumes    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation deliveries    total volumes sold and delivered    utility operating revenues residential and commercial revenues    unbilled revenues    weather sensitive revenues    industrial firm sales revenues    industrial interruptible sales revenues    total gas sales revenues    transportation revenues    other revenues    total utility operating revenues    cost of gas sold    total number of customers end of period    actual degree days    year average degree days    residential and commercial nw natural continues to experience a rapid customer growth rate relative to others in the industry 
the  customers added during represent a growth rate of percent  repeating the record growth rate achieved in in the three years ended december   more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
weather conditions were percent warmer than average in  percent colder than average in  and percent warmer than average in average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
weather in was percent warmer than in while was percent colder than typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to  and revenues derived from  these customers 
the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers during were comparable to  reflecting the combined effects of residential and commercial volumes added from customer growth  offset by reduced gas use due to warmer weather 
related revenues decreased percent primarily due to rate decreases effective december  the addition of  customers and percent colder weather in compared to resulted in a percent increase in related revenues over in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers through the end of the period 
industrial sales  transportation and other revenues the combined margin from industrial sales and transportation decreased percent in  from million in to million in  and increased percent from million in to million in total volumes delivered to industrial customers were million therms  or percent  higher in than in the decrease in margin despite increased volumes in reflects the migration by some customers to lower rates under special anti bypass contracts 
total volumes delivered to industrial customers were million therms  or percent  higher in than in in addition to higher volumes  margin improved in due to higher prices under industrial incentive rate schedules which are designed to track changes in oil prices 
nw natural did not experience margin losses from new bypasses of its system in  or although nw natural does not expect a significant number of its large customers to bypass its system in the foreseeable future  it may experience further deterioration of margin associated with customers transfers to contracts with pricing designed to be competitive with the capital and operating costs of direct connections to npc s system 
other revenues primarily relate to adjustments in regulatory accounts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other revenues for included million from the amortization of property tax savings and million from the amortization of oregon income tax savings 
in  other revenues included million from the amortization of property tax savings  million from regulatory amortizations  and two non recurring gains 
specifically  nw natural recorded a gain of million for the recovery of costs and lost revenues related to energy conservation programs approved by the opuc 
nw natural also recorded a gain of million as the result of a settlement with the opuc concerning amounts to be refunded to oregon customers from prior year savings in property taxes and oregon income taxes 
in  other revenues included a one time  million payment under a contract with portland general electric company pge  an electric utility based in portland 
this contract gave pge the option to request gas transportation service for electric generation at one or more sites in nw natural s service territory 
additionally  other revenues in included million from amortization of the interruptible sales adjustment account and million from other regulatory amortizations 
cost of gas the cost per therm of gas sold during was percent lower than in  while such cost in was percent lower than in the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage  demand cost equalization  regulatory deferrals  and company use 
for the years  and  the cost of gas sold was reduced by non regulated gas sales of million  million  and million  respectively 
under an agreement with the opuc  these sales are treated as a reduction of gas costs 
the average cost per therm of gas purchased was percent higher in than in  due to fluctuations in prices nw natural paid for the portion of its gas supplies tied to monthly market price indexes 
nw natural has a purchased gas cost adjustment pga tariff under which its net income from oregon operations is affected only within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
in  nw natural absorbed percent of the higher cost of gas purchased  as compared to projections  under its oregon pga tariff 
the remaining percent of the higher gas costs was recorded as deferred debits regulatory assets 
effective january   the incentive formula for deferred gas costs was modified so that nw natural will absorb percent of the difference between actual and projected gas costs and the remaining percent will be deferred for recovery or refund to customers in future rates 
subsidiary operations consolidated subsidiary earnings for were million  equivalent to cents a share  compared to million  or cents a share  in  and million  or cents a share  in see note to the consolidated financial statements

oregon natural earned million in compared to million in oregon natural s earnings in and included one time gains from asset sales  including a million gain from the sale of underground storage assets to nw natural in  and a million gain from the sale of its gathering system and gas producing properties in the gain was partially offset by a million impairment loss on producing wells and a million write down of unproven properties 
operating expenses operations and maintenance consolidated operations and maintenance expenses were million  or percent  lower in than in nw natural s operations and maintenance expenses in decreased million  or percent  compared to primarily due to a one time charge of million in for litigation see chase gardens litigation  below  offset by increases in customer service and market development expense million  electronic and network services million  and environmental investigation and remediation charges million 
included in operations and maintenance expense was a million increase in payroll due to salary increases as well as wage increases resulting from nw natural s new seven year labor agreement effective april  subsidiary expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared to primarily due to a decline in oil and gas production costs 
nw natural s operations and maintenance expenses in were million higher than in  while subsidiary expenses decreased million

nng energy systems  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that was dissolved in  recorded a gain in resulting from the reorganization of its california cogeneration subsidiary 
interest charges nw natural s interest charges increased million  or percent  in compared to due to the issuance of million of medium term notes during and higher commercial paper balances outstanding 
the average commercial paper balances increased from million in to million in the increases in nw natural s long term and short term debt balances were primarily due to the financing of its million utility construction program and million in deferred gas costs 
interest charges in increased million  or percent  compared to  also due to higher long term and short term debt balances outstanding related to the financing of nw natural s utility construction expenditures  and to accrued interest charges of million for post judgment interest for the chase gardens litigation 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of funds used during the construction of utility plant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  and  afudc reduced interest expense by million  million and million  respectively 
the weighted average afudc rates were percent in  percent in and percent in see financing activities below 
income taxes the effective corporate income tax rate for the years ended december  was percent for and percent for both and the lower tax rate was primarily due to permanent tax savings from the change in book depreciation rates  an increase in tax credits  and a reversal of amounts previously recorded for a california solar energy investment that was sold by financial corporation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant increase in income tax expense was due to the million  or percent  increase in income before income taxes compared to in  nw natural recorded an adjustment reducing tax expense for the year by million  or cents a share  for reversal of deferred tax amounts provided in prior years

nw natural finances these expenditures from cash provided by operations and from short term borrowings which are periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
in addition to its capital expenditures  the weather sensitive nature of gas usage by nw natural s residential and commercial customers influences the company s financing requirements 
short term liquidity requirements are satisfied primarily through the sale of commercial paper  which is supported by commercial bank lines of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s long term goal is to maintain a capital structure comprised of to percent common stock equity  to percent preferred and preference stock and to percent short term and long term debt

the company has lease and purchase commitments related to its operating activities which are financed with cash flows from operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities cash requirements for nw natural s capital expenditures in totaled million  up million  or percent  from the increase included expenditures for expansion of the mist underground storage facility million  completion of the new customer information system cis software development million  transportation equipment million  expansion and reinforcement of the gas distribution system to accommodate customer growth million  land purchases for a new service center million  and the upgrading of other computer system hardware and software million 
the million increase in capital expenditures in compared to resulted largely from higher amounts expended for the gas distribution system in order to serve significant customer growth million  the ongoing development of the new cis which had been delayed in million  and the development of a remote data terminal system million 
nw natural s construction expenditures are estimated at million for over the five year period through  these expenditures are estimated to be million to million 
the higher projected level of capital expenditures over the next five years reflects continued high customer growth  a major system reinforcement project and the development of additional underground storage facilities 
about half of the required funds are expected to be internally generated  with the remainder to be funded through a combination of long term debt and equity securities with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
nw natural invested million in both and in canor s exploration and production program to supplement canor s internally generated funds 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash used for financing of million in and million in the primary financing activities which accounted for the change from were nw natural s sale of million of its medium term notes in and the net issuance of million of commercial paper  partially offset by the redemption of million of long term debt 
significant financing activity in consisted of nw natural s sale of million of medium term notes  the net issuance of million of commercial paper and the redemption of million of long term debt 
in  financing activity consisted primarily of nw natural s sales of million of common stock and million of medium term notes  the redemption of the remaining shares of the series of convertible preference stock and a net decrease of million of commercial paper 
ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and  the company s ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges  and fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium  and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income 
contingent liabilities like all companies with business application software programs  the company is affected by the year issue 
much of this software  which includes nw natural s customer service  operations  and financial systems  was written using two digits to define the year  rather than four 
any of the company s software that is time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than this could result in the computer shutting down or performing incorrect calculations 
nw natural has identified and is in the process of correcting the systems within its control that could be affected by the year issue 
in  the consultant that performed an assessment of nw natural s application software estimated that the cost of making its application source code for these systems year compliant would be about million 
nw natural believes that with the appropriate modifications  it will be able to operate its time sensitive software programs beyond the turn of the century 
nw natural has identified major vendors for which it depends on products or services and is contacting such vendors to hear what plans they have to correct problems they may face with year compliance 
the company can make no assurances regarding the year compliance status of systems or parties outside its control  and cannot assess the effect on it of any non compliance by such systems or parties 
in december  the opuc authorized nw natural to defer and amortize over five years  commencing january   its incremental costs for assessment  planning and renovation of systems for year compliance 
environmental matters nw natural owns property in linnton  oregon  that is the site of a former gas manufacturing plant that was closed in in  pursuant to oregon department of environmental quality odeq procedures  nw natural submitted a notice of intent to participate in the odeq s voluntary cleanup program and  in  the site was listed on odeq s confirmed release list and inventory 
during  initial tests revealed environmental contamination  but the extent or the estimated cost of remediation cannot yet be determined 
nw natural continues to monitor this site 
nw natural expects that its costs of investigation and any remediation at the linnton site for which it may be responsible should be recoverable  in large part  from insurance or through future rates 
during the period from through  nw natural recorded as expense a total of million for the estimated costs of consultants fees  odeq oversight and the voluntary investigation 
in  the eugene water and electric board eweb asked nw natural to participate in an investigation and the potential remediation of a acre site of a former manufactured gas plant in eugene  oregon 
nw natural purchased the property in  after the plant had been converted to a liquid propane gas plant 
it used the propane plant until when the system was converted to natural gas  and continued to use the site as a service center until when it was sold 
to date  nw natural has not agreed to participate in an investigation of the site and has not obtained sufficient information to determine the extent of its responsibility  if any  for remediation of the site
