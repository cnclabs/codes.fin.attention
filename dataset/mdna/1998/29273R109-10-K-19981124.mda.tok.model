item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage and the partnership should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial and operating data and notes thereto  and the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general since its formation in  heritage has grown primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
through august   heritage and the partnership completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the partnership has completed of these acquisitions since going public on june  the partnership engages in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
the partnership derives its revenue primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes that the partnership is the sixth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states through retail outlets 
annual retail propane sales volumes in gallons were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel that burns in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
the retail propane distribution business is largely seasonal due to propane s use as a heating source in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume and in excess of of the partnership s ebitda is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flow from operations  however  is greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
a substantial portion of the partnership s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in the partnership s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on the financial performance of the partnership 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
the partnership therefore uses information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations  which bases the assumption that normal weather will prevail in each of the partnership s regions 
the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which the partnership will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce the partnership s gross profits 
in the past  the partnership generally attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
the partnership has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities for future resale 
gross profit margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
analysis of historical results of operations the following discussion reflects for the periods indicated the results of operations and operating data for the partnership 
most of the increases in the line items discussed below result from the acquisitions made by the partnership during the periods discussed 
in fiscal  the partnership consummated seven acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in fiscal and  the partnership consummated seven and eight acquisitions for total purchase prices of million and million  respectively 
these acquisitions affect the comparability of prior period financial matters  as the volumes are not included in the prior period s results of operations 
amounts discussed below reflect of the results of m p energy partnership  formerly named m p oils partnership  a general partnership in which the partnership owns a interest 
because m p energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to the partnership s net income and ebitda is not significant 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
the partnership sold million retail gallons  an increase of million gallons or from the million gallons sold in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to acquisition related volumes offset  to a certain extent  by the effects of the warmer weather pattern of el nino 
the partnership also sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal  a decrease of million wholesale gallons or from the million wholesale gallons sold in fiscal the decrease in wholesale volumes was attributable to a decline of million gallons in the foreign operations of m p energy partnership and million gallons in us wholesale operations  both primarily due to warmer than normal weather in those areas of operations 
revenues 
total revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal domestic retail fuel revenues increased million or in fiscal to million  as compared to million for fiscal us wholesale revenues decreased million or from million reported in fiscal foreign revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in us and foreign wholesale revenues was attributable to both decreased volumes and sales prices 
the increase in domestic retail revenues resulted from increased volumes and offset somewhat by decreased sales prices 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to fiscal s million 
domestic cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal foreign cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in foreign cost of sales was attributable to decreased volumes sold and a decrease in the cost per gallon of propane 
the decrease in domestic cost of sales was also due to a decrease in the cost per gallon of propane and the decrease in domestic wholesale volumes for fiscal  offset by the increased volumes of retail fuel 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal as  compared to million in fiscal this increase was attributable to the acquisition related increase in retail volumes sold  the impact of higher margins and an increase in other propane related gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal a slight increase as compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased approximately million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of additional depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was the result of the increase in gross profit offset by the acquisition related increase in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization 
net income 
net income increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase is due to higher operating income for fiscal as compared to  offset partially by increased interest costs in fiscal ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization was million for fiscal  an increase of million or over last year s ebitda of million 
increased gross profit for fiscal  offset by the acquisition related increase in operating expenses attributed to the increase in this year s ebitda 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
during fiscal  the partnership sold retail gallons  an increase of million retail gallons or from the million retail gallons sold in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable both to the volume increases from acquisitions and internal growth  offset by warmer than normal weather during the heating season in the partnership s southeast and southwest areas of operations 
the partnership also sold million wholesale gallons in fiscal  a decrease of million gallons or from the million wholesale gallons in fiscal this decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in wholesale volumes in the foreign operations of m p oils partnership 
revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased million or to million  as compared to million for fiscal domestic revenues increased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal foreign revenues increased million to million for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in foreign revenues was attributable to an increase in the selling price 
the increase in domestic revenues was attributable to higher selling prices and greater volumes associated with acquisitions and internal growth 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales increased million to million for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal domestic cost of sales increased million or for fiscal to million as compared to for fiscal foreign cost of sales increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal during fiscal  the propane industry witnessed the most volatile propane market since  with the wholesale cost of propane raising rapidly during the heating season 
the increase in foreign cost of sales is primarily attributable to higher propane costs 
the increase in domestic cost of sales is attributable to the increase in propane costs for fiscal and the increase in retail volumes 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal in spite of the rapid increases in propane costs during the heating season in fiscal  the partnership was able to retain strong margins 
the strong margins experienced in fiscal and the increased retail volumes were responsible for the increase in gross profit over fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the majority of this increase was attributable to an increase in wages and plant operations resulting from acquisitions 
vehicle expenses also contributed to this increase  with the majority of the partnership s vehicles operating on propane  due to higher own use fuel costs associated with higher propane prices and volumes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million or as compared to million for fiscal this increase resulted from costs associated with changing to and operating as a public master limited partnership 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase was the result of additional depreciation and amortization associated with the increase in property  plant  and equipment along with intangible assets from the acquisitions the partnership has made 
operating income 
operating income increased million to million  a increase in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to the partnership having increased volumes related to acquisitions and retaining strong margins on these volumes  offset by the acquisition related increases in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization costs 
net income 
net income increased million to million in fiscal  a increase as compared to fiscal s net loss of million 
this increase is the result of higher operating income in fiscal and as well as conversion to a partnership form during fiscal the partnership is not subject to federal income tax whereas the company provided a million income tax provision in fiscal the partnership also experienced an extraordinary loss of million on the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal year ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million  or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to the increase in domestic margins  plus volumes related to acquisitions and internal growth partially offset by the related increase in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by various sources as follows a increases in working capital will be financed on the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable b payment of interest cost  and other debt services  will be provided by the annual cash flow from operations c required maintenance capital  predominantly vehicle replacement  will also be provided by the annual cash flow from operations d growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition bank line of credit e acquisition capital expenditures will be financed with additional indebtedness on the revolving acquisition bank line of credit  other lines of credit  issues of additional common units or a combination thereof 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  was million compared to million in fiscal the cash flows from operations for fiscal consisted primarily of net income of million and noncash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures for acquisitions amounting to million  net of cash received plus million spent for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels  new customer tanks to support growth of operations and other miscellaneous capitalized items 
these amounts were partially offset by the proceeds from asset sales of million 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million resulted primarily from a net increase in long term debt of million used for acquisitions 
this increase was offset by cash distributions to unitholders of million and a net reduction in the working capital facility of million 
financing and sources of liquidity the partnership has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes  and an acquisition facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and improvements 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
the partnership uses its cash provided by operating and financing activities to provide distributions to unitholders and to fund acquisition  maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for fiscal year  as compared to million during fiscal in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during fiscal  million of common units were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time nor complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations 
description of indebtedness the operating partnership assumed million principal amount of senior secured notes the notes at the formation of the partnership in a private placement with institutional investors 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each december and june the notes have a final maturity of years  with ten equal mandatory repayments of principal beginning on june  see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
on november   the partnership entered into a note purchase agreement medium term note program  that provides for the issuance of up to million of senior secured promissory notes if certain conditions are met 
an initial placement of million series a and b at an average interest rate of with an average year maturity was completed at the closing of the medium term note program 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each november and may an additional placement of million series c  d and e at an average interest rate of with an average year maturity was completed in march interest is payable on series c  d and e semi annually in arrears on each september and march the proceeds of the placements were used to refinance amounts outstanding under the acquisition facility 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
the note purchase agreement  medium term note program and bank credit agreement contain customary restrictive covenants applicable to the operating partnership including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens and sale of assets 
in addition  the operating partnership must maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda and consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
these agreements also provide that the operating partnership may declare  make or incur a liability to make a restricted payment during each fiscal quarter  if a the amount of such restricted payment  together with all other restricted payments during such quarter  do not exceed available cash with respect to the immediately preceding quarter  and b no default or event of default exists before such restricted payment and after giving effect thereto 
the agreements provide that cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to of the interest to be paid on the notes 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made on the notes  available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to  and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such payment dates 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all requirements  tests  limitations and covenants related to the notes and bank credit facility 
year matters the year issue arose because many computer programs use only the last two digits to indicate the year  hence  they may not interpret dates beyond the year the partnership has recognized the potential impact of this problem that could cause computer applications to fail or create erroneous results and along with outside consultants  has conducted a detailed assessment of its year compliance and readiness 
the partnership has put a comprehensive program in place to prepare for its year readiness 
the partnership is reviewing and evaluating both their information technology it and non it systems 
a complete and detailed inventory list of the partnership s hardware and software systems has been established enabling them to evaluate the state of readiness of these systems 
the partnership s district operations use a variety of external software that has been evaluated for year compliance 
the upgrade of the software at these district locations is currently underway 
the hardware necessary to accommodate the software upgrades will be replaced as needed 
completion of this phase is anticipated by march the partnership s central accounting system  payroll system and miscellaneous applications used are also in the process of being upgraded with completion anticipated january the upgraded software in both the district locations and at the administration level is scheduled for testing and user training starting december and to be completed in early spring the non it systems such as telephones  fax machines  and photocopiers will be investigated for the date critical year and will be replaced or updated as needed for operation 
the partnership has identified major vendors and suppliers on whom it depends upon for services and product to assess their year readiness to assure there are no interruptions in operations 
a year compliance letter and questionnaire is being sent to these third parties with responses anticipated by december interruption of the supply and delivery of gas products could have a material adverse affect on the operations of the partnership 
by contacting these third parties to assess their state of readiness and developing an appropriate contingency plan if necessary  the partnership is hoping to minimize these risks 
in the fiscal year ended august   dynegy liquids marketing and trade provided approximately of the partnership s total domestic propane supply 
the partnership believes that  if supplies from dynegy were interrupted  it would be able to secure adequate propane supplies from other sources without a material disruption of its operations 
aside from dynegy  no single supplier provided more than of the partnership s total domestic propane supply in the fiscal year ended august  furthermore  no single customer accounted for or more of the partnership s revenues during fiscal year alleviating the risk of adverse affects if some but not all customers are not year compliant 
the partnership s banking facilities are also being contacted to insure that the collection and transfer of funds will not be interrupted and that extension of working capital will be available as needed 
acquisition candidates are supplied with a compliance letter and questionnaire also to assess the potential needs of their systems 
the partnership does expect the costs to modify its computer based systems to have a material effect on the partnership s results of operations 
the current estimates of the amount of time  personnel  and costs to modify the current systems to be year compliant is less than 
million 
a portion of these costs is expected to be capitalized as they relate to adding new software and hardware to enhance current operations 
costs related directly to becoming year compliant will be expensed as incurred 
estimated costs to date have not been specifically tracked but are estimated to be immaterial 
the partnership expects that its it and non it systems will be compliant by the target dates listed 
a contingency plan is being developed to deal with system failures 
the partnership will primarily focus on one of the systems currently being tested that would be compliant 
if other systems fail during the testing  they will be upgraded to the compliant system 
the success it has with dealing with the issues of the year and its vendor and supplier s success in the matter will affect the partnership s future operations 
interruptions in the partnership s operations or those of its major suppliers due to year failures could have a material adverse affect on its operations and cash flows
