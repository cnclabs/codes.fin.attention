item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year the corporation has identified all significant information technology it applications that will require remediation  which in some cases will involve the replacement of systems  to ensure year compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications and to test for year compliance 
the corporation plans to complete the modifications and testing process of all significant it systems by august  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
as of october  the corporation believes it has remediated approximately of its non compliant it systems 
total costs connected with the remediation of the corporation s significant it systems during and totaled million and million  respectively 
estimated future costs total million 
approximately of the total costs  representing investment in new it systems  will be capitalized and depreciated over three to five years 
the total cost of the year project has not had nor is it anticipated to have a material impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations and will be funded through operating cash flows 
while certain aspects of the corporation s businesses could operate on a manual basis for a period of time  in the event year compliance for its significant it systems is not reached  the corporation currently believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be the inability to sustain its current level of performance and customer service 
additionally  a significant failure of the banking systems or key entities in the financial markets could adversely affect the corporation s ability to access various credit and money markets 
the corporation is therefore committed to taking all appropriate actions to achieve year compliance for its significant it systems before the millennium change date 
the corporation has developed a detailed plan  which includes an anticipated remediation completion date for each significant it system and a scheduled overall completion date of august management reviews the progress under the action plan on a weekly basis 
whenever management concludes a material risk exists that a significant it system will not be remediated by the scheduled overall completion date  a contingency plan is developed 
the corporation has initiated formal communications with all significant third party suppliers which provide operational support and non it systems to determine the extent to which the corporation would be vulnerable in the event that one or more of those third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
the corporation has received assurances from its significant suppliers of cash management services that they will be able to operate in the year and beyond  without interruption in service 
while the corporation believes that it does not have significant exposure to other significant suppliers year problems  it is seeking compliance assurances from such other significant suppliers 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year continued the costs of the project and the date on which the corporation believes it will complete the year remediation are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of qualified personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
