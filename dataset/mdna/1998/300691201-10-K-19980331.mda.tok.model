item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in  and first shipped its objectstore database management system in initially  the company concentrated on marketing its products for use in engineering design and analysis  telecommunications  finance and other industries that required specialized database management capabilities not readily available from relational database management systems 
in late  the company appointed a new chief executive officer and chief operating officer  replaced several other members of its senior management team and embarked upon a company wide restructuring program including layoffs and other expense reduction measures 
in  recognizing the potential opportunity created by the rapid growth of the internet  the company commenced a new initiative to provide database management solutions for the emerging internet computing market 
in  the company expanded this initiative beyond the internet to address the broader market for component based computing 
the company has devoted  and expects to continue to devote  substantial resources to promoting objectstore as a solution for developing and deploying component based computing applications 
in recent quarters  the company has increased its expenditures on sales and marketing and expects this pattern to continue 
future success will depend on the company s ability to expand its direct sales force as well as the market acceptance of its products 
the company s failure to expand its direct sales force sufficiently in late and early contributed to lower than expected revenues in since the first quarter of  the company has replaced its vice president of worldwide sales  has added a new level of sales management primarily promoted from the ranks of its more experienced and productive sales representatives and has recruited a substantial number of new sales representatives 
the company has expended substantial resources in this effort  including expenditures for salaries and advances against commissions for new direct sales personnel  recruiting fees  travel and other expenses  and expects these expenses to increase in future quarters 
past experience has proven it can take six to twelve months for a newly hired sales representative to become fully productive 
as a result  the full benefits of increased expenditures on direct sales personnel and related recruiting costs are not typically obtained  if at all  for several quarters 
in april  the company entered into a relationship with international business machine corporation ibm 
at that time ibm purchased shares of the company s preferred stock  which was converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon the company s ipo 
the company and ibm also signed certain business agreements the ibm agreements under which ibm would be entitled to develop and market products in which the company s objectstore database management system would be embedded  and the parties would undertake certain joint product development and marketing activities

related party software and services revenues 
revenues from related parties decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease is primarily due to a drop in ibm revenue which resulted from the discontinuation of a joint development project in  which was partially offset by a single large purchase of software licenses by ibm in the first quarter of the company expects related party software and services revenues to continue to decline in future periods

cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million for the year ended december  from million in and increased as a percentage of service revenues to from for such periods  respectively 
the increase in cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues reflects the company s initiative to invest in non billable activities to ensure successful customer deployments of component based applications based on objectstore as well as the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenue and provide ongoing quality customer support to the company s increasing installed base 
the company expects non billable activities to account for a smaller percentage of overall service costs in future periods 
as a result  the company expects cost of service revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars  but at a slower rate than service revenues 
cost of related party software and services revenues 
the cost of related party software and services revenues declined  to  in the year ended december  from  in  and declined as a percentage of related party software and services revenues to from in such periods  respectively

the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
the company s agreements with the bank contain various covenants  including financial covenants tested on a quarterly basis  that require maintenance of a specified quick ratio  leverage ratio and minimum capital base and prohibit losses in excess of a specified maximum 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the bank agreements that is not waived by the bank or cured  the bank is entitled to  among other things  demand payment of all outstanding amounts and terminate the letters of credit 
at december   the company was in compliance with the bank s covenants 
the company conducts portions of its business in currencies other than in us dollar 
the company does not expect that it will incur any significant risk of currency translation loss due to fluctuations in those other currencies  as the amounts are not material 
the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents marketable securities  capital leases  bank facilities and funds generated from operations  if any  will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
year computer systems compliance customers of the company have requested that the company certify that its products are year compliant  and failure of the company s products to be year compliant could lead to substantial liability on the part of the company 
the company has audited its objectstore database management system and believes that  with the exception of certain minor administrative functions that do not affect the utility of the product  objectstore is year compliant in all material respects 
the company has not yet completed its audit of certain third party software programs that are incorporated in the company s rapid application development and enterprise integration tools 
although the company believes  based on the nature of these programs  that it is unlikely that any of them is year non compliant in a manner that would impair the utility of the company s product in which it is incorporated or require the company to incur substantial expense to correct such noncompliance  there can be no assurance that this is the case 
in addition  the company utilizes in its internal operations a number of computer software programs  including programs used to manage the company s financial and accounting functions as well as in the company s sales  marketing and product development activities 
the inability of such programs to interpret properly data for the year and beyond could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
failure by the company to identify a year problem in its software products or in any software program used in its operations could require modification or replacement of such software 
even if all such problems are identified  resolution of the problem could require significant expenditures and might not be achievable by january  the company costs incurred in the year compliance effort will be expensed as incurred 
any such year problem affecting the company s products or software programs used in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar statements are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s future shipments  revenue and expense levels and profitability  as well as the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements  may be forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance  and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements whether in response to new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s future success will depend to a substantial degree on the emergence and widespread adoption of component based computing as a methodology for developing and deploying multi user business applications 
there can be no assurance that component based computing will become  and remain  an accepted methodology for developing and deploying enterprise wide business applications or that the company s component based products and services will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
the company will need to continue to expand its sales force in order to gain market share in the short term 
sales personnel are difficult to recruit and retain and the company has limited experience in training and managing a large and growing sales force 
as the company expands its sales and marketing efforts into the component based computing market  the profile of customers is shifting from large telecommunications and financial institutions to a broader group of small and large companies in many industry segments 
as a result  sales personnel now need to develop and manage an increasing number of smaller dollar value transactions 
the result could be less accurate sales forecasting 
the company s marketing department also needs to develop a stream of qualified leads at a more rapid pace than in the past in order to keep the sales force at high productivity 
the company is reliant on product innovation and new product releases to keep it competitive 
any delay in the release of products or failure of released products to meet the market expectation of functionality and features could undermine the company s competitive position 
furthermore certain of the company s competitors are significantly larger and are expending greater amounts on research and development and sales and marketing than is the company 
the result could be new competitive product introductions that could limit the salability of the company s products  put pressure on sales prices  or diminish the reputation of the company as a leader in object oriented database technology 
the company typically receives the majority of its revenue in any quarter in the last month of the quarter 
this pattern  common to many software companies  makes it difficult to forecast accurately  increasing the possibility of missing a quarterly revenue or profit target 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is derived from sales by its international subsidiaries and to distributors outside the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for objectstore 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
