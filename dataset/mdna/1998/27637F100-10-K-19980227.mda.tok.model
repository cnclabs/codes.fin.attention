c description of business boston gas company boston gas is engaged in the transportation and sale of natural gas to approximately  residential  commercial  and industrial customers in boston  massachusetts  and other communities in eastern and central massachusetts 
boston gas also sells natural gas for resale 
boston gas  the largest natural gas distribution company in new england  has been in business for years and is the second oldest gas company in the united states 
since  all of the common stock of boston gas has been owned by eastern 
boston gas provides local transportation services and gas supply for all customer classes 
boston gas services are available on a firm and non firm basis 
firm transportation services and sales are provided under rate tariffs filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy the department  formerly the department of public utilities  that typically obligate boston gas to provide service without interruption throughout the year 
non firm transportation services and sales are generally provided to large commercial industrial customers who can use gas and oil interchangeably 
non firm services  including sales to other gas companies for resale  are provided through individually negotiated contracts and  in most cases  the price charged takes into account the price of the customer s alternative fuel 
in  the department approved boston gas proposal to unbundle local transportation service and gas sales for its largest commercial industrial customers  and in  to all commercial industrial customers 
unbundling allows customers to purchase local transportation from boston gas separately from the purchase form k of gas supply  which the customer may buy from other suppliers 
boston gas views these third party suppliers as trade allies in marketing gas and increasing its throughput and expects to work closely with these trade allies to facilitate the unbundling process and ensure a smooth transition  especially in the tracking and processing of transactions 
while the migration of customers from firm sales to transportation only service will lower boston gas revenues  it has no impact on boston gas operating earnings 
boston gas earns all of its margins on the local distribution of gas and none on the resale of the commodity itself 
boston gas has also implemented a program to educate commercial industrial customers about the opportunity to purchase gas from third party suppliers  while still relying on boston gas for delivery 
in the fourth quarter of  boston gas recorded a charge of million in connection with its decision to exit the gas appliance repair and service business 
markets and competition the majority of boston gas sales are for space heating and in this market it competes with other fuel distributors  primarily oil dealers  throughout its service territory 
over the last six years  boston gas has increased its share in the total stationary energy market from to 
this market share compares to the national average of approximately and may represent a growth opportunity for boston gas 
however  actual experience cannot be predicted with certainty  and will depend on such factors as the price of competitive energy sources  the level of investment by boston gas and customer perceptions of relative value 
gas throughput the following table  in billions of cubic feet of natural gas at  btu per cubic foot bcf  provides information about boston gas throughput during the three years years ended december  residential commercial industrial off system sales total sales transportation of customer owned gas 
less off system sales total throughput firm throughput residential customers comprise of its customer base  while commercial industrial establishments account for the remaining 
volumetrically  residential customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput  while commercial industrial customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput  as depicted in the chart below 
in  approximately of the commercial industrial customers total throughput was local transportation only services 
no customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for more than of total firm revenues in boston edison company was responsible for of the transportation of customer owned gas

boston area weather colder of normal normal warmer form k gas supply the following table in bcf provides information about boston gas sources of supply during years ended december  natural gas pipeline purchases liquefied natural gas lng purchases total purchases change in storage gas company use  unbilled and other 
total sales year to year variations in storage gas and unbilled gas reflect variations in end of year customer requirements  due principally to weather 
given the ready availability of supply  boston gas purchased approximately two thirds of its peak pipeline supplies under short term and spot contracts 
the balance of peak day pipeline requirements is purchased directly from domestic and canadian producers and marketers pursuant to long term contracts which have been reviewed and approved by the department or by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
pipeline supplies are transported on interstate pipeline systems to boston gas service territory pursuant to long term contracts 
ferc approved tariffs provide for fixed demand charges for the firm capacity rights under these contracts 
the interstate pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to boston gas service territory  the peak daily and annual capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows capacity in bcf expiration pipeline daily annual dates algonquin gas transmission company algonquin tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee in addition  boston gas has firm capacity contracts on interstate pipelines upstream of the algonquin and tennessee pipelines to transport natural gas purchased by boston gas from producing regions to the algonquin and tennessee pipelines 
the expiration dates for these contracts are similar to those included in the above table 
boston gas has contracted with pipeline companies and others for the storage of natural gas in underground storage fields located in pennsylvania  new york  maryland and west virginia 
these contracts provide for storage capacity of bcf and peak day capacity of bcf 
boston gas utilizes its existing capacity contracts to transport gas from the storage fields to its service territory 
supplemental supplies of lng and propane are purchased and produced from foreign and domestic sources 
peak day throughput was bcf in and bcf in and boston gas provides for peak period demand through a least cost portfolio of pipeline  storage and supplemental supplies 
boston gas considers its peak day sendout capacity  based on its total supply resources  to be adequate to meet the requirements of its firm customers 
regulation boston gas operations are subject to massachusetts statutes applicable to gas utilities 
rates  gas purchases  pipeline safety regulations  issuance of securities and affiliated party transactions are regulated by the department 
rates for firm transportation and sales provided by boston gas are subject to approval by  and are on file with  the department 
in addition  boston gas has a cost of gas adjustment clause which allows for the adjustment of billing rates for firm gas sales to enable it to recover the actual cost of gas delivered to firm customers  including the demand charges for capacity on the interstate pipeline system 
form k on may   the department responded to boston gas request for reconsideration  clarification and recalculation of certain sections of the department s november rate order  which had granted a million increase 
in its may order  the department granted an additional million in revenues and reduced the productivity offset in the performance based rate pbr formula established in its november order by basis points  from to 
compared to the department s original decision  these changes will add approximately million to revenues in  increasing to about million by  the last year of the plan 
on june   boston gas filed a notice of appeal of the department s orders to the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
boston gas expects that the appeal will be heard sometime in and that any relief granted by the court will be prospective 
on july   the department directed all ten investor owned gas distribution companies in massachusetts to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
the department deferred the second phase of boston gas unbundling proceeding  which is to address residential unbundling and a permanent capacity assignment method  subject to its assessment of the progress of the collaborative discussions 
on november   the department approved rate schedules designed to implement the million rate increase approved by the department in boston gas first pbr compliance proceeding 
in its november order  the department also approved boston gas proposal to facilitate competition in the natural gas marketplace 
under the approved service unbundling program  on an interim basis  eligible commercial and industrial customers migrating from firm sales to firm transportation will be assigned  at cost  a pro rata share of the upstream pipeline capacity purchased by boston gas to serve them 
at the department s direction  permanent assignment of upstream pipeline capacity is currently being addressed as part of the collaborative process discussed above 
the capacity assignment method ultimately approved by the department could permit capacity to be acquired by marketers at less than cost 
if that is the case  there can be no assurance that boston gas will be permitted to recover such costs until the department has addressed their recoverability 
the collaborative is also examining how to extend unbundled transportation service to residential customers 
boston gas and eastern were granted an intrastate exemption from the provisions of the public utility holding company act of under section a thereof  pursuant to an order of the securities and exchange commission dated february   as amended by orders dated november  and august seasonality and working capital boston gas revenues  earnings and cash flows are highly seasonal as the demand for most of its transportation services and sales is directly related to temperature conditions 
the majority of boston gas earnings is generated in the first quarter  with a seasonal loss occurring in the third quarter 
since the bulk of its revenues is billed in the november through april heating season  significant cash flows are generated from late winter to early summer 
in addition  through the cost of gas adjustment clause  boston gas bills its customers over the heating season for pipeline demand charges paid by boston gas over the entire year 
the lag between payment and billing of demand charges  along with other costs of gas distributed but unbilled  is reflected as deferred gas costs and is financed through short term borrowings 
short term borrowings are also required from time to time to finance normal business operations 
as a result of these factors  short term borrowings are generally highest during the late fall and early winter 
environmental matters boston gas may have or share responsibility under applicable environmental law for the remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
information with respect to environmental matters may be found in note of notes to financial statements 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
employees as of december   boston gas had approximately  employees  of whom were organized in local unions with which boston gas has collective bargaining agreements that expire in form k properties boston gas owns or leases facilities which enable it to liquefy natural gas in periods of low demand  store the resulting lng and vaporize it for use in periods of high demand 
boston gas owns and operates such a facility in dorchester  massachusetts  and leased one such facility in lynn  massachusetts 
in addition  boston gas leased an lng storage facility in salem  massachusetts 
both leases expired on june  negotiations for purchase of the leased facilities were unsuccessful and the matter is now in litigation 
boston gas continues to use the facilities pursuant to a stipulation and agreement between the parties that provides for million to be held in escrow and suspends boston gas rent payment obligation while the stipulation and agreement is in effect 
the stipulation and agreement terminates on the earlier of the resolution by judgment or settlement of the litigation or october  boston gas also owns propane air facilities at several locations throughout its service territory 
on december   boston gas distribution system included approximately  miles of gas mains   services and  active customer meters 
a majority of the gas mains consist of cast iron and bare steel  which requires ongoing maintenance and replacement 
boston gas mains and services are generally located on public ways or private property not owned by it 
boston gas occupation of such property is generally pursuant to easements  licenses  permits or grants of location 
except as stated above  the principal items of property of boston gas are owned in fee 
in  boston gas capital expenditures were million 
capital expenditures were principally made for system replacement  for system expansion to meet customer demand and for productivity enhancement initiatives 
boston gas plans to spend approximately million for similar purposes in  with a slightly higher proportion for system expansion 
midland enterprises inc midland  through its wholly owned subsidiaries together midland  is engaged in the operation of a fleet of barges and towboats  principally on the ohio and mississippi rivers and their tributaries  the gulf intracoastal waterway and the gulf of mexico 
midland transports dry bulk commodities  a major portion of which is coal 
midland also performs repair work on marine equipment and operates two coal dumping terminals  a phosphate rock and phosphate chemical fertilizer terminal and a marine fuel supply facility 
sales midland transported million  million  and million tons in  and  respectively 
tonnage in declined from  primarily as a result of the non renewal of several multi year contracts  unplanned plant outages for several major customer accounts and lower demand from export coal and grain markets 
tonnage in declined from as a result of reduced grain tonnage due in part to a shortage of grain supplies and the resulting weak demand for barge towing on the lower mississippi river 
ton miles are the product of tons and distance transported 
the following charts depict tonnage by commodity and ton miles of cargo transported for the period 
pie chart 
tonnage by commodity coal other grain 
bar graph 
ton miles by commodity coal grain other liquid total other includes sand  stone  gravel  iron  scrap  steel  alumina  coke  phosphate  towing for others  and other commodities 
form k in  ton miles declined due to the lower tonnage  as discussed above  partially offset by longer average hauls  particularly for coal 
in  ton miles declined from the record level set in due to a decline in tonnage and slightly shorter average trip lengths 
in addition to changes in ton miles transported  midland s revenues and net earnings are affected by other factors such as competitive conditions  weather and the segment of the river system traveled  as described further in the seasonality and competition sections 
the following table summarizes midland s backlog of transportation and terminalling business under multi year contracts december  tons in millions revenues in millions portions of revenue backlog not expected to be filled within the current year the revenue backlog which is based on contracts that extend beyond december  is shown at prices in effect on december   which are subject to cost escalation de escalation provisions 
since services under many of the multi year contracts are based on customer requirements  midland has estimated its backlog based on its forecast of the anticipated requirements of these contract customers 
the decline in tonnage backlog from mainly reflects the elapsing terms of current multi year contracts as they draw closer to maturity  including those excluded from the calculation as they enter their final year 
the decrease in the revenue backlog is consistent with the reduction in backlog tonnage 
electric utilities  which traditionally have entered into multi year transportation and coal supply agreements  have begun to shorten the term of some agreements for a variety of reasons such as clean air act requirements and increasing competitive pressures resulting from the ongoing deregulation of the electric power industry 
these factors have also led to changes in the sourcing of coal by utilities  leading to changes in traffic patterns 
the only significant raw material required by midland is the diesel fuel to operate its towboats 
diesel fuel is purchased from a variety of sources and midland regards the availability of diesel fuel as adequate for its operations 
seasonality revenues during winter months tend to be lower than revenues for the remainder of the year due to the freezing of some northern waterways  increased coal consumption by electric utilities during the summer months and the fall harvest of grain 
competition midland s inland marine transportation business competes on the basis of price  service and equipment availability 
midland s primary competitors include other barge lines and railroads  including one integrated rail barge carrier 
there are a number of companies offering transportation services on the waterways served by midland 
a shortage of grain supplies and sharply higher grain prices slowed demand in late and market rates softened 
in  a stronger us dollar and increased competition from foreign suppliers to the world markets slowed us exports of grain and coal  which weakened demand for barges 
coupled with an increased availability of new equipment  a temporary imbalance of supply and demand has been created  which has led to more intense competition and decreased spot rates 
in approximately of total revenues were accounted for by one customer  the cincinnati gas and electric co  a subsidiary of cinergy corp  under a multi year coal transportation agreement 
no other customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for more than of revenues in  or on the basis of past experience and its competitive position  midland considers that the simultaneous loss of several of its largest customers  while possible  is unlikely to happen 
midland s multi year transportation and terminalling contracts expire at various dates from february through december during  approximately of midland s revenues resulted from these contracts 
a substantial portion of the contracts provide for rate adjustments based on changes in various costs  form k including diesel fuel costs  and  additionally  contain force majeure clauses that excuse performance by the parties to the contracts when performance is prevented by circumstances beyond their reasonable control 
many of these contracts have provisions for termination for specified causes  such as material breach of contract  environmental restrictions on the burning of coal  or loss by the customer of an underlying commodity supply contract 
penalties for termination for such causes are not generally specified 
however  some contracts provide that in the event of an uncured material breach by midland that results in termination of the contract  midland would be responsible for reimbursing the customer for the differential between the contract price and the cost of substituted performance 
improvements in operating efficiencies have permitted barge operators to maintain comparatively low rate structures 
consequently  the barge industry generally has been able to retain its competitive position with alternate methods of transportation for bulk commodities  particularly when the origin and destination of such movements are near or contiguous to navigable waterways 
towboats  such as those operated by midland  are capable of moving in one tow barge configuration approximately  tons of cargo equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the ohio river and upper mississippi river and approximately  tons equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the lower mississippi river  where there are no locks to transit 
barge transportation costs per ton mile are generally below those of railroads 
environmental matters midland is subject to the provisions of the federal water pollution control act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  the superfund amendment and reauthorization act  the resource conservation and recovery act of  and the oil pollution act of which permit the coast guard and the environmental protection agency to assess penalties and clean up costs for oil  hazardous substance  and hazardous waste discharges and is further subject to comparable state environmental statutes in the states where it operates 
some of these acts also allow third parties to seek damages for losses caused by such discharges 
compliance with these acts has had no material effect on midland s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position  and no such effect is currently anticipated 
properties as of december   midland s marine equipment consisted of  dry cargo barges and towboats 
approximately half of this equipment is owned outright and unencumbered and the remaining half is either mortgaged to secure midland s equipment financing obligations or chartered under long term leases from third parties 
in  midland s capital expenditures were million 
these expenditures were made principally for the purchase of new barges and for refurbishment of equipment 
in midland expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment  primarily for the purchase of new barges 
employees as of december   midland employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately are represented by labor unions

form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements 
compared to overview the company reported net earnings of million  or per share  in  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  in per share figures are presented on a diluted basis  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
excluding non recurring items and eastern s share of allenergy s losses  earnings and earnings per share declined approximately to million  or per share  in versus million  or per share  in change in millions revenues boston gas midland total  the decrease in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects decreased demand for barge transportation and lower rates at midland and lower average usage and the migration of customers from firm gas sales to transportation only service  partially offset by sales to new customers  at boston gas 
change in millions operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total the decrease in operating earnings from to primarily reflects the impact of decreased revenues and poor operating conditions at midland  partially offset by higher rates and lower operating expenses at boston gas 
other income primarily reflects losses of million and million in and  respectively  representing eastern s share of allenergy s operating losses 
eastern sold its investment in allenergy in december the effective tax rate in was  which was lower than in  primarily because of prior year adjustments 
boston gas revenues in decreased by primarily because of lower average customer usage  the migration of customers from firm sales to transportation only service and the impact of comparatively warmer weather  partially offset by sales to new customers and the full year impact of the rate increase 
weather for was colder than normal  but warmer than operating earnings increased from  primarily reflecting growth in throughput  lower operating expenses  higher rates and a million gain on the settlement of pension obligations  partially offset by the margin impact of lower average usage and warmer weather and a higher charge for depreciation  reflecting continued investment in system replacement and expansion 
while weather was only warmer than  weather for the first quarter of  when boston gas generates most of its revenues and earnings  was warmer than the prior year 
the migration of customers from firm sales to transportation only service has no impact on boston gas operating earnings 
boston gas earns all of its margins on the local distribution of gas and none on the resale of the commodity itself 
during the fourth quarter of boston gas recorded non recurring revenues of approximately million related to a change ordered by the rate ruling regarding the recovery mechanism for the portion of bad debt expense associated with gas costs 
this income was largely offset by a charge of form k approximately million related to boston gas decision to exit the gas appliance repair and service business 
midland enterprises revenues in decreased primarily because of weak export demand for coal and grain  lower contractual requirements for utility and industrial coal customers and fewer barges 
weak demand depressed spot rates for nearly all commodities  and traffic patterns were disrupted  reducing operational efficiency 
operating conditions in were worse than those experienced in  as navigation was negatively impacted by record flooding on the ohio river early in the year  and later by long traffic delays related to low water and repairs to various key locks throughout the river system 
these uncontrollable events resulted in higher operating costs and lower fleet productivity than in as a result of the weaker markets  midland slowed its fleet replacement program and did not renew expiring charters of outside barges 
these decisions  in addition to production delays which postponed the delivery of new barges expected in the latter part of  reduced the size of midland s barge fleet 
tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  reflecting the weak market and operational issues discussed previously  although a change in business mix and customer sourcing resulted in longer average hauls 
coal tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  from the record levels of domestic coal volume  primarily for electric utilities  declined due to the non renewal of several multi year contracts  unplanned plant outages and milder temperatures 
export coal demand weakened as the strong us dollar effectively raised the prices of domestic supplies higher than foreign competitors 
despite an ample grain harvest  the anticipated surge in transportation volume and pricing for grain exports was short lived  as much of the harvest was put in storage due to reduced demand and the relative strength of the us dollar 
ongoing improvement programs to lower vessel operating costs and administrative expenses partially offset the higher operating costs discussed above 
operating results at midland s terminals were also lower  reflecting the reduced demand for coal transportation 
as a result of the adverse market and operational issues discussed above  operating earnings decreased by in compared to change in millions revenues boston gas midland total  the increase in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects higher customer usage  colder weather  and increased sales to new customers for boston gas and increased demand for coal and other commodities at midland 
change in millions operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total the increase in operating earnings from to primarily reflects the gross margin impact of boston gas increased revenues  as described above 
other income in includes increased interest income on higher cash balances and decreased interest expense  reflecting lower average rates principally due to the refinancing of million of boston gas debentures in december and lower balances of short term obligations 
partly offsetting were the absence of a million gain on the sale in of eastern s us filter investment and a million provision for environmental expenses  as described in notes and of notes to financial statements 
form k in  other income includes a loss of million  representing eastern s share of allenergy s operating results 
the effective tax rate in was higher than in  principally because the gain on the sale of the us filter investment was offset by a tax loss realized on the sale of waterpro supplies corp  which had been written down in boston gas revenues in increased by due principally to higher average customer usage  the impact of colder weather  increased sales to new customers and increased non firm sales 
the migration of firm sales to transportation service was partially offsetting 
weather for was colder than normal 
weather for was near normal 
operating earnings increased from  primarily reflecting the margin impact of increased revenues 
benefits from ongoing reengineering programs and the absence of severance costs and lower consulting expenses also contributed to the increase in operating earnings 
wage increases and higher charges for depreciation were partially offsetting 
midland enterprises revenues and operating earnings increased by and  respectively  in over  primarily reflecting the continued strong demand for coal and other dry cargo commodities and favorable rates 
severe icing and flooding during the first quarter of and generally more difficult operating conditions later in the year resulted in higher operating costs and lower fleet productivity than in tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  reflecting shorter average hauls due to reduced foreign demand for coal and a shortage of grain supplies 
coal tonnage and ton miles increased and  respectively  reflecting significantly increased shipments of domestic spot coal  while coal shipments under multi year contracts for utilities declined due to the non renewal of several contracts 
non coal tonnage and ton miles declined as a result of weaker barge demand for grain exports on the lower mississippi river 
ongoing programs to increase fleet productivity were offset by adverse operating conditions and traffic pattern inefficiencies caused by the reduced export tonnage 
fuel costs increased in due to rising fuel prices that averaged above levels 
forward looking information this report and other company reports and statements issued or made from time to time contain certain forward looking statements concerning projected future financial performance  expected plans or future operations 
eastern cautions that actual results and developments may differ materially from such projections or expectations 
investors should be aware of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking projections or expectations 
these factors include  but are not limited to the effect of strategic initiatives on earnings and cash flow  temperatures above or below normal in boston gas service area  changes in market conditions for barge transportation  adverse weather and operating conditions on the inland waterways  changes in economic conditions  including interest rates and the value of the dollar versus other currencies  regulatory and court decisions and developments with respect to eastern s previously disclosed environmental and coal act liabilities 
most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond eastern s control 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that projected cash flow from operations  in combination with currently available resources  is more than sufficient to meet eastern s capital expenditure and working capital requirements  potential funding of its coal act and environmental liabilities  normal debt repayments and anticipated dividends to shareholders 
in addition to cash and marketable investments of million at december   eastern maintains a million long term revolving credit agreement plus uncommitted lines  all of which are form k available for general corporate purposes 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under any of these facilities 
to meet working capital requirements which reflect the seasonal nature of the local gas distribution business  boston gas had commercial paper outstanding of million at december   a decrease of million from the prior year  primarily reflecting lower balances for deferred gas costs 
in addition  boston gas maintains a bank credit agreement which supports the issuance of up to million of commercial paper to fund its inventory of gas supplies 
at december   boston gas had outstanding million of commercial paper for this purpose 
consolidated capital expenditures for are budgeted at approximately million  with about at boston gas and the balance at midland 
eastern s capital structure is depicted in the chart below 
subject to the effects of strategic initiatives which eastern might undertake  eastern expects to continue its policy of capitalizing boston gas and midland with approximately equal amounts of equity and long term debt 
both subsidiaries currently maintain a ratings with the major rating agencies

see note of notes to financial statements 
the transaction is structured as a tax free merger and is to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
to effect the merger  eastern will issue shares of its stock for each share of essex stock 
the actual number of eastern shares to be issued will be adjusted to ensure that the value of eastern common stock to be issued for each essex share will not be less than nor more than  based upon the average market price during a specified period prior to closing 
based on essex shares outstanding and issuable at december  and the above exchange ratio  approximately million shares of eastern stock will be issued to effect the merger 
the merger is subject to a number of conditions  including receipt of regulatory and essex shareholders approval 
in december  eastern sold its interest in allenergy marketing company  llc for million 
on october  the united states supreme court granted eastern s petition for a writ of certiorari and agreed to hear eastern s challenge to the constitutionality of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act 
in april  the first circuit court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of the coal act as applied to eastern  and it is that decision that will now be reviewed by the supreme court 
the supreme court s ruling is expected by june  eastern has accrued pretax charges of million for its estimated undiscounted liability for health care and death benefit premiums under the coal act 
as discussed in note of notes to financial statements  its obligations for these premiums could range from a nominal amount to more than million 
on may  boston gas received a decision from the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy the department  formerly the department of public utilities  concerning its request for reconsideration  clarification and recalculation of the department s november rate form k order 
the department granted boston gas an additional million rate increase a million increase was granted in the november order and reduced the productivity offset portion of the performance based rate formula established in its november order by basis points  from to 
compared to the department s original decision  these changes will add approximately million to projected revenue in  increasing to about million by  the last year of the performance based rate plan 
on june   boston gas filed a notice of appeal of the department s orders to the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
boston gas expects the appeal to be heard some time in eastern may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation and or ongoing maintenance of certain non utility sites associated with former operations  the most significant of which is a former coal tar processing facility  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
eastern has accrued a reserve of approximately million at december   to cover the potential remediation and maintenance costs of these sites 
however  eastern does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine or estimate the ultimate cost to it of such remediation and maintenance 
boston gas may have or share responsibility under applicable environmental law for the remediation of former manufactured gas plant mgp sites  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
a subsidiary of new england electric system has assumed responsibility for remediating of these sites  subject to a limited contribution from boston gas 
boston gas has recorded a liability of million  which represents its best estimate at this time of remediation costs  which may reasonably be estimated to range from million to million 
however  there can be no assurance that such costs will not vary considerably from these estimates 
by a rate order issued on may   the department approved the recovery of all prudently incurred environmental response costs associated with former mgp sites over separate  seven year amortization periods  without a return on the unamortized balance 
boston gas has recognized an insurance receivable of million  reflecting a negotiated settlement with an insurance carrier for environmental expense indemnity  and a regulatory asset of million  representing the expected rate recovery of environmental remediation costs  net of the insurance settlement 
eastern currently believes  in light of the indemnity agreement with the nees subsidiary and the department rate order on environmental cost recovery  that it is not probable that such costs will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
eastern and its subsidiaries have assessed the impact of the year issue with respect to their information systems and are currently modifying those systems as part of a plan which eastern believes will provide year compliance 
anticipated spending for these modifications is being expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material impact on operating results or financial condition
