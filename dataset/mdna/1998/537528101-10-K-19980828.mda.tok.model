the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

as a result  the company engaged arthur andersen llp to evaluate the matter and determine the impact  if any  on the company s previously and currently reported consolidated financial statements 
after extensive review  analysis and evaluation  which focused on unlocated differences in cash balances  management believes that an employee defalcation occurred during fiscal the employee was able to circumvent existing internal controls largely due to lapses in appropriate segregation of duties regarding cash deposits and disbursements  inter bank transfers and bank account reconciliations 
this lapse in the segregation of such duties was further exacerbated by the resignation of the company s assistant treasurer on february   which office was not filled until april  two individuals  one of whom was an employee of the company  were arrested on february  in connection with this defalcation and charged with embezzlement and appropriation of the property of the company 
lorraine quetel  the former employee  has pled guilty to the embezzlement of million 
the criminal action against lydia magras is still pending 
the estimated loss of approximately million has been classified as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended may  as a result of the charge  the company filed amended financial statements on form q for each of the quarters within fiscal accordingly  the comparative consolidated statements of income for the three month period ended november  reflect a net loss of  or per share  including a charge to administrative expense of  which  after tax  negatively impacted net income and earnings per share by  and  respectively 
for the six month period ended november   the comparative consolidated statements of income reflect a net loss of million or per share  including a charge to administrative expense of  which  after tax  negatively impacted net income and earnings per share by  and  respectively 
the company has insurance coverage which calls for a maximum claim limitation of  a claim for the full amount of the loss has been submitted and payment of the  has been received 
the amount of insurance recovery from its insurance carrier relating to these losses has been reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended may  to date  the company has received  in restitution from the employee 
on march   the company filed a civil action against the employee and certain other parties alleged to be involved in the defalcation seeking full restitution from such parties  however  the company does not know what  if any  of the funds are still in the possession of the employee and such other parties 
see item legal proceedings 
although the company continues to work to improve its accounting and reconcilation methods  since the defalcation  certain of these methods have been revised to improve monitoring of the company s systems 
for example  the company s accounting system has been revised to facilitate the closer monitoring of detail transactions  so that each separate transaction is posted rather than posting totals by category 
in addition  the company s treasury and accounting staffs have been increased and their functions upgraded and reorganized in an attempt to provide adequate segregation of duties and more timely bank account reconciliations 
accordingly  unlike at the time of the defalcation  no one person has control over cash deposits and disbursements  inter bank transfers and bank account reconciliations 
as part of its sales audit  the company also has begun reconciling cash register deposits for each of its stores 
as an additional check on the system  a new cash flow report is prepared daily and reviewed by management of the company 
this cash flow report sets forth  for each day  the bank balance  the book balance  disbursements  transfers and float ie  checks outstanding against the company s credit line 
merger transaction in the fall of  the board of directors of the company decided to explore various strategic alternatives  including potential business combinations with third parties 
in this regard  the company  through its financial advisor  wasserstein perella co  inc  conducted a controlled sales process to determine the interest of third parties in acquiring the company 
as part of this process  the company engaged in discussions with drhc as well as other third parties concerning a potential sale of the company 
following extensive negotiations  the company entered into the merger agreement  dated as of february   with drhc and certain of its affiliates  pursuant to which drhc would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the company at the effective time of the proposed merger for per share in cash 
as required under the merger agreement  the board of directors scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for may  to request stockholder approval of the merger agreement 
in connection with the special meeting of stockholders  the company mailed proxy materials to the stockholders of the company on april  on may   the company announced that it had received correspondence from drhc s counsel indicating that drhc s financing commitment letters from donaldson lufkin jenrette  inc and dlj bridge finance  inc 
collectively  dlj had terminated on april  in accordance with their terms and that dlj  at that particular time  did not intend to extend or renew the commitment letters 
on may   following stockholder approval of the proposed merger  the company notified drhc that the company had satisfied all of the conditions to the merger agreement and informed drhc that it was prepared to close the proposed merger at that time 
in response  drhc informed the company that it was not yet prepared to close the proposed merger  indicated that it did not have the financing necessary to consummate the proposed merger and requesting an extension of between and days 
on may   the company announced that it had received a second request by drhc for a ninety day extension in exchange for certain limited concessions 
in response  the company indicated that it was prepared to grant a two week extension in exchange for drhc s acknowledgment that all conditions to the merger had been satisfied and the concessions offered by drhc 
although  the company had the contractual right to terminate the merger agreement  the company continued to work diligently with drhc and its representatives to understand the structure  timing and likelihood of destination s financing 
in connection with the extension negotiations  drhc repeatedly refused to provide the company with financial or other form of security or to reimburse the company s merger related expenses going forward in exchange for the company granting an extension 
as a result of its diligence and these negotiations  it became clear to the board of directors that it was highly unlikely that drhc would be able to raise the funds necessary to consummate the proposed merger 
on june   the company terminated the merger agreement because of drhc s inability to raise the financing necessary to consummate the proposed merger 
litigation against drhc as a result of the company s losses associated with the termination of the merger agreement  on june  the company filed a civil action in the united states district court for the district of delaware civil action no 
slr against drhc  stephen crane  drhc s controlling stockholder  and certain of drhc s affiliates 
the company alleges breach of the merger agreement and also alleges claims of misrepresentation and civil conspiracy  among other causes of action 
the company is seeking monetary damages  including  without limitation  consequential damages relating to harm to its business 
on july   the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims 
in addition  mr 
crane moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him 
the court has now ruled that the company may pursue certain discovery before responding to these motions and the parties are currently engaging in such discovery 
rolex prior to entering into the merger agreement with drhc  the company was the exclusive authorized retailer for rolex watches on the islands on which the company operates 
following the execution of the merger agreement with drhc  rolex suspended shipments of its products to the company because rolex indicated that it did not believe it would be in its best interest to begin a business relationship with drhc 
the company received its last shipment of rolex products in january  following the termination of the merger agreement  on june   the company made numerous attempts to rebuild its business relationship with rolex 
however  on july   the company announced that it had learned that rolex had decided not to resume shipments of its watches to the company for retail sale through little switzerland s stores 
sales of rolex watches accounted for  and of the company s sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that the loss of rolex will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ending may  and beyond 
in order to mitigate the impact on sales of the loss of rolex as a supplier  the company is actively exploring opportunities for expanding existing  and adding new  world class product lines in both watches and jewelry 
see item business product lines watches 
there can be no assurances that the company s actions in replacing rolex products with new or expanded watch and jewelry products will be successful or that the sales of these new or expanded products will reduce the effect of the loss of rolex as a supplier on the company s sales

maarten st 
martin  antigua and alaska reporting strong double digit gains

in addition  inventory reductions continued in the china  crystal  gift and accessory categories for repositioning purposes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended may  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is due primarily to million in charges incurred as the result of the failed merger with drhc see merger transaction  and a million non cash charge resulting from the company s recognition of impaired asset values related to the goodwill at the world gift import barbados limited subsidiary

the company has elected to adopt sop during fiscal as required by sop  the company has recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million net of applicable tax to expense previously capitalized start up costs 
this charge has been classified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for fiscal year ended may  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

the weighted average interest rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company s income is subject to taxation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates at rates ranging from to  and  accordingly  the effective tax rate for any given year is a function of the relative mix of taxable income generated at each of the company s locations

while it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the cost of this work  the company expects that such costs will not be material to its results of operations in one or more fiscal quarters or years  and these costs will not have a material adverse impact on the long term results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position of the company 
system maintenance or software modification costs will be expensed as incurred  while the costs of new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended may  increased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales for stores open in all of fiscal and decreased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal both the large increase in overall sales and the comparable store sales decline are attributable to the impact in fiscal of hurricanes luis and marilyn which inflicted damage to several of the company s stores and caused significant damage to various islands infrastructures 
those stores that were not damaged and did remain open in fiscal benefited from the closure of neighboring stores and thus reported higher than normal sales 
the store located on the harbor in marigot  st 
martin  the last of the hurricane damaged stores  reopened in november  while the reopening of the company s hurricane damaged stores and the opening of two new stores in fiscal contributed to the overall increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  management believes that the impact of the hurricanes continued to have a negative impact on sales into fiscal gross profit margin improved from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal management attributes this improvement to the stronger us dollar measured against european currencies partially offset by the impact on margins of certain inventory liquidation efforts

gross profit margin decreased from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal the company attributed this decline to the weak us dollar as compared to european currencies during the early portion of fiscal as well as the impact of certain fixed components of cost of sales as measured against a much lower sales base 
sg a expenses were million or million and higher than a year ago 
management attributed these increases mostly to new stores opened during fiscal net interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase reflects higher average borrowings  primarily due to the company s acquisition of the inventory  leasehold rights and fixed assets of two stores in barbados in february the weighted average interest rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s income is subject to taxation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates at rates currently ranging from to  and  accordingly  the effective tax rate for any given year is a function of the relative mix of taxable income generated at each of the company s locations

the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for liquidity are to support its inventory requirements  which fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of the company s business  and to maintain and remodel its existing stores and finance the opening or acquisition of new stores 
inventory is maintained at levels to adequately meet the demands of customers who  as tourists  require immediate delivery of purchased goods 
cash provided by operations during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the loss of approximately million in cash as a result of the employee defalcation during fiscal see employee defalcation loss 
the company has available unsecured credit facilities of million of which million in borrowings were outstanding as of may  these credit facilities with the company s two lead banks are up for renewal during the second and third quarters of fiscal management anticipates that these credit facilities will be renewed in due course 
it  however  has no assurance at this time the such renewals will be granted 
if these credit facilities are not renewed or the terms of these credit facilities are materially changed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
additionally  on august   the chase manhattan bank approved a million line of credit the chase credit facility  which the company will use to support its inventory requirements for the peak selling season 
according to the term sheet  the chase credit facility expires days from the date of the initial drawdown  which must occur no later than october  the company has not entered into definitive loan documents with chase manhattan bank  and there is no assurances that such loan documents will be entered into 
further  in february  the company secured term debt of approximately million from its two lead banks to finance its acquisition of the fixtures  leasehold rights and inventories of two stores in barbados 
interest on this debt is payable monthly and the principal is payable in equal quarterly payments over a four year period commencing march the company is in compliance with  or has obtained waivers for  all restrictive covenants related to its unsecured and term debt agreements

this arrangement allows the company to more effectively design and decorate its stores with quality furnishings consistent with the prestigious image the company maintains 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature  reflecting travel patterns to the caribbean 
the peak selling season in the caribbean runs from late fall through spring 
accordingly  approximately one third of the company s sales have historically occurred during the third fiscal quarter  and the company may incur losses in the first and second fiscal quarters 
working capital requirements generally reflect this seasonality as the company increases its inventory in anticipation of the peak selling season 
since the company has less cash available in the off season  it may be necessary to borrow to finance its build up of inventory and any expansion of the company s operations

inflation historically  the company has generally been able to increase prices to reflect cost increases resulting from inflation and expects to be able to do so in the future 
while the company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation on its operations  the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation during the three most recent years 
exchange rates while the company receives united states dollars for most of its sales  a significant portion of the company s inventory purchases are transacted in foreign currencies 
because of the company s need to maintain adequate levels of inventory  the company must place large orders for merchandise many months in advance of when it will receive payment for the merchandise from customers 
the company s ability to offer attractive pricing of luxury goods purchased in foreign currency depends in part on the relative exchange rates between the united states dollar and the various foreign currencies 
the company engages in hedging transactions to minimize the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations for purchase commitments and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
the company believes that foreign currency hedging has been effective in minimizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on gross margin in prior years and expects to continue this program
