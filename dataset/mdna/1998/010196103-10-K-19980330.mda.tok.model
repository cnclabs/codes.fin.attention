the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering in may for a full year in fiscal  as opposed to only approximately months in fiscal  offset by funds expended on the development of the phd system 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s net loss was million per share for the year ended december   an increase of million per share from the net loss of million per share for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million

general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million

through december   the company had received net offering proceeds from public and private sales of equity securities of approximately million 
since its inception in through december   the company made million of capital expenditures and used million in cash to support its operations 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  working capital of million and long term investments of million 
in january  the company also received million in proceeds from its sale of common stock to teijin limited of osaka  japan see also business foreign operations 
the company estimates that during it will spend approximately to million for operations  manufacturing scale up and commercialization of the phd system 
the company expects that substantially all of this amount will be used to i purchase molds  tooling and other assets to be used by independent contractors to produce the phd system and pay for other preproduction costs of such contractors payable by the company  ii fund product testing and validation including the purchase of phd systems for use in clinical trials from such independent contractors  iii conduct clinical studies using the phd system  iv establish and train a sales and marketing staff and v establish and train a customer service and technical support staff 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial expenses related to manufacturing scale up and commercialization of the phd system and the protection of patent and other proprietary rights 
the company believes that cash and investments as of december   together with proceeds from its sale of common stock to teijin and future milestone payments to be received from teijin under the terms of the joint development agreement  are sufficient to finance the company s operations  except for working capital needs related to production of machines  through december  generally  the company expects us customers to purchase phd systems and enter into contracts whereby the company will provide all products and services related to the phd systems for a single monthly price  which would include all consumables  service and product support 
as an alternative  us customers may enter into lease agreements for the phd systems  under which the single monthly price would also include a lease payment 
the company s present commercialization plan for markets outside of the united states is to develop a partnership in those markets to distribute the phd system and related consumables and service 
financing production of the phd system in quantities necessary for commercialization will require a significant investment in working capital 
this need for working capital is likely to increase to the extent that demand for the phd system increases 
the company would  therefore  have to rely on sources of capital beyond cash generated from operations to finance production of the phd system even if the company is successful in marketing its products and services 
the company currently intends to finance the working capital requirements associated with these arrangements through equipment and receivable financing with a commercial lender 
if the company is unable to obtain such equipment financing  it would need to seek other forms of financing  through the sale of equity securities or otherwise  to achieve its business objectives 
the company has not yet obtained a commitment for such equipment financing  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain equipment financing or alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with obtaining fda clearance or approval  continued progress in research and development  clinical studies  manufacturing scale up  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that the company s plans change  its assumptions change or prove inaccurate or it is unable to obtain production financing on commercially reasonable terms  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
in addition  in the future the company will require substantial additional financing to fund full scale production and marketing of the phd system and related services 
the company has no current arrangements with respect to sources of additional financing 
there can be no assurance that fda clearance or approval will be obtained in a timely manner or at all or that additional financing will be available to the company when needed  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the investments of the company have been made for investment as opposed to trading purposes 
interest rate risk with respect to the investments of the company is not significant as substantially all of such investments are in us dollar cash equivalents and short term investments with maturities of less than months  which are by their nature less sensitive to interest rate movements 
the investments of the company are generally made in us government and federal agency bonds and high grade commercial paper and corporate bonds
