item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview all of the company s operating revenues are derived from the production and sale of oil and gas 
prior to mid  the company was principally engaged in the purchase and production of oil and gas reserves  primarily in california 
in mid  the company changed its business strategy and now concentrates in exploration projects onshore and offshore louisiana and texas and in the related transition zone 
operating revenues increased slightly from to  primarily because production from the east bayou sorrel exploration success more than offset depletion declines and the reduced revenues from the effect of selling a portion of south timbalier block in early in the company sold its california properties  but revenues increased from as production from the south timbalier block acquired in late contributed to revenues for a full year 
results in were adversely affected by substantial impairments to oil and gas properties  debt conversion expense and stock offering costs 
results in were adversely affected by a substantial loss on sale related to the company s california properties 
no such loss or expense was recorded in general and administrative expense increased significantly in because of the addition of executive personnel and litigation costs 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expense may increase further as the scope of the company s oil and gas exploration activities are expanded in future years 
the company experienced substantial net losses in and primarily attributed to the items described above  and a smaller net loss in operations contributed cash in and  primarily due to relatively high gas prices and or increases in production  but consumed cash in because of low gas prices during early and the shut in of one of the company s primary california properties 
substantial sales of equity securities in resulted in significant increases in the weighted average shares outstanding in net loss per share decreased in as a result of a decrease in the net loss from operations and an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding 
the company made substantial net investments in oil and gas properties in and  and a somewhat smaller net investment in for the three years through  the company s primary sources of capital have been the sale of equity and proceeds from the sale of the california properties 
during this same period  the company reduced its total debt by million almost and  as a result of restructuring its borrowing relationships  significantly increased the maturity of its remaining debt obligations 
the company believes that it has adequate capital resources to satisfy its obligations over the short term 
the company also believes that its operating cash flow will increase as a result of successful exploitation of its inventory of projects and prospects and that this increased cash flow will be the basis for future company growth 
however  there can be no assurance that fortune will be successful in exploiting any of its projects 
in the event that fortune s operating cash flow does not increase significantly  or management determines to accelerate the growth plans for the company  the company will continue to require equity and debt financing for additional capital 
results of operations years ended december  and fortune had a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the increased net loss in is primarily attributable to the following items million non cash impairments to oil and gas properties  a  non cash debt conversion expense incurred in connection with closing the company s debenture exchange offer in february and  of stock offering costs expensed as a result of the company withdrawing a proposed public offering in april see notes and to the financial statements 
net oil and gas revenues increased slightly in compared to revenues included revenues from the company s california properties that were sold in february and march and a higher ownership interest at south timbalier block through march on march   the company sold of its interest in the south timbalier block for  pursuant to a preexisting option agreement 
revenues were adversely affected by shutting in the south timbalier block well from march  to april  for a workover 
the same well was also shut in from april  to june  for a prior workover 
offsetting these decreases was the commencement of production at east bayou sorrel from permanent production facilities in january the second well at east bayou sorrel was completed and placed on production on june  a third well at east bayou sorrel is currently being tested 
oil production increased in compared to as a result of the bayou sorrel discovery 
gas production decreased in versus  primarily because of the reduced ownership interest in in south timbalier block  as discussed above  and natural depletion on the company s properties 
gas prices for the company s production averaged per mcf in as compared to per mcf in oil prices averaged per bbl in compared to per bbl in production and operating expenses decreased by  in compared to the decrease results primarily from the company s sale of its relatively expensive to operate california properties in early both and were adversely affected by the workovers at south timbalier block that cost approximately  in and  in interest expense decreased by  for compared to due to the lower average debt balance for most of the company s debt balance increased during the fourth quarter of and the company expects to incur higher interest expense in compared to see liquidity 
the company s provision for depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a increased to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in because of higher average property costs and lower average proved reserves in the company is aware of the issues associated with the inability of many computer systems worldwide to recognize dates beyond december  and that a failure to correct this problem could result in significant disruption to those systems 
the company has reviewed its internal and accounting systems and believes that they are year compliant 
although the company believes that these issues will not adversely impact its operations  there can be no assurance that disruption or expenses will not occur as a result of the inability of the company s vendors or customers to deal with this problem on a timely basis 
the company will continue to monitor the status of these issues to determine the impact  if any  on its operations 
years ended december  and fortune had a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the higher net loss in is primarily attributable to a million loss on the sale of the california properties 
net revenues from sales of oil and gas increased to million for compared to the increase resulted primarily from the combination of higher gas prices and a full year of production from south timbalier block the production was adversely affected by a month shut down of the company s hopper canyon  california oil field due to storm damage 
although revenues were up  they were adversely affected by a two month shut down of the company s south timbalier block well due to a mechanical failure in the second quarter of this well accounted for about of the company s oil and gas revenues in the company incurred approximately  in workover costs to repair the problem  most of which was expensed as production and operating expense in june and july gas prices for the company s production averaged per mcf for as compared to per mcf for oil prices averaged per bbl in compared to per bbl in these higher average prices contributed to the increase in revenues 
production and operating expenses decreased by  in compared to despite the expense of the south timbalier workover discussed above 
the decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from the company s sale of its california properties in early in  fortune s general and administrative expenses increased by  over the increase was due primarily to higher legal fees resulting from certain litigation  costs incurred in the sale of the company s california properties  increased shareholder reporting expense and increased personnel expense 
the company also incurred non recurring office relocation and severance costs of  during in connection with the company s move to houston 
interest expense decreased by  for compared to due to the lower debt balance in the lower depletable property balance  resulting from the sale of the california properties recorded in december  led to a decrease in the company s provision for depletion  depreciation and amortization of  in as compared to depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in liquidity cash balance and working capital although the company s cash balance decreased from to  working capital increased significantly to  at december  compared to  at december  refinancing the company s bank debt in july and completing a convertible subordinated debt offering in december were major contributing factors to this increase in working capital 
during  operating activities and financing activities were providers of cash while investing activities were net users of cash 
cash flows from operating activities fortune s net cash flow provided by operating activities increased in to  as compared to  in changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable were significant components of these net cash flow amounts in both years 
accounts payable increased in as a result of increased exploration activity and accounts receivable decreased in primarily as a result of lower year end prices 
before considering changes in asset and liability accounts  net operating cash flow still increased in to  compared to  in the absence of corporate relocation costs in and lower interest and production and operating expense in contributed to this increase 
the company s exploratory discovery at east bayou sorrel  iberville parish  louisiana had no impact on the company s revenues in its impact on production was partially offset by the items discussed in the operating results section above 
the third well at east bayou sorrel is currently being tested 
fortune s cash flow provided by operating activities increased for to  as compared to an operating cash flow deficit of  for this increase resulted from higher gas prices and higher gas production in as discussed above 
fluctuations in current asset and liability accounts also contributed to the variance 
cash flow in was adversely affected by the shut in of the south timbalier block well for over two months in the second quarter of  resulting in a loss of revenues from the well  and workover expenses incurred to bring the well back on production 
capital resources cash used in investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures funded with cash for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures consisted primarily of million for d seismic and leases at espiritu santo bay  million for development at east bayou sorrel and million for the acquisition of an additional interest at east bayou sorrel 
capital expenditures were primarily for four exploratory wells east bayou sorrel  lirette  dabm and south lake arthur and continued lease and seismic acquisition offshore louisiana 
capital expenditures for were principally attributable to capital expended to acquire  explore and develop the company s new mexico  larosa and awp properties  begin the acquisition of seismic and leases offshore louisiana  acquire south timbalier block for million  and drill the exploratory well at aurora 
in june  zydeco returned to the company million of exploration venture cash under the terms of the venture agreement  as discussed in note to the financial statements 
the cash was previously reported on the company s balance sheet as restricted cash in other assets 
the company also received million for the sale of the california properties that was used to retire debt in february and  for the sale of of its interest in south timbalier block see business and properties exploration activities and property acquisition activities 
fortune s net capital expenditures for its acquisition  exploration and development activities in are currently estimated to range from approximately to million  depending on the company s capital resources 
the company intends to provide for these expenditures with its available cash  its cash flow from operations and  to the extent approved in advance by the bank  its bank credit facility 
should funds not be available to the company as required for participation in the projects  the company can reduce its working interest share of the projects 
should the company s working interest in exploration projects be reduced  the company would not derive as great a benefit in the event of an exploration success 
cash flows from financing activities outstanding debt and debt reduction the company borrowed million of new debt in while reducing other debt by million 
in connection with issuing new debt  the company significantly increased the maturity of its debt  million of which is due in and the remaining million of which is due in at the beginning of  all of the company s debt was due in total debt at december  stood at million  million of which is subordinated convertible debt

forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements may be found in this section  under items and business and properties and elsewhere 
forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding future oil and gas production and prices  future exploration and development spending  future drilling and operating plans  reserve and production potential of the company s properties and prospects  the company s strategy and the company s competitive and regulatory environment 
actual events or results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  without limitation  the factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
exploration risks 
the business of exploring for and  to a lesser extent  of acquiring and developing oil and gas properties is an inherently speculative activity that involves a high degree of business and financial risk 
although available geological and geophysical information can provide information with respect to a potential oil or gas property  it is impossible to determine accurately the ultimate production  if any  which will result from a particular property or well 
dependence on limited number of wells 
over of the company s oil and gas revenues  cash flow and proved oil and gas reserves is currently accounted for by three wells  the south timbalier block well and the two east bayou sorrel wells 
the south timbalier block well was recently shut in for repairs and was shut in for over two months during as the result of a mechanical failure 
a significant curtailment or loss of production from these wells for a prolonged period before the company could replace the reserves through new discoveries or acquisitions would have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and financial condition 
volatility of oil and gas prices 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing market prices for oil and gas  which can be extremely volatile 
in addition to market factors  actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments  and international cartels affect oil and gas prices 
all of these factors are beyond the control of the company 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas 
the average gas prices received by the company were  and per mcf in  and  respectively 
the average oil prices received by the company were  and per bbl in  and  respectively 
as of february  the company was receiving an average of approximately per mcf for its gas production and per bbl for its oil production 
these current prices represent declines from december prices and the company expects further price declines through the spring and summer of uncertainty of estimates of proved reserves and future net revenues 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in this annual report represent only estimates 
estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise 
such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels  future gas and oil prices and future operating costs made using currently available geologic engineering and economic data  some or all of which may prove to be incorrect over time 
estimates of the economically recoverable oil and gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
as a result of changes in these assumptions that may occur in the future  and based upon further production history  results of future exploration and development  future gas and oil prices and other factors  the quantity of proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward adjustment 
in addition  the estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves of the company and the present value thereof are based on certain assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may not prove to be correct over time 
operating and weather hazards 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions 
the company s operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and gas properties and the drilling of oil and gas wells  including encountering unexpected formations or pressures  corrosive or hazardous substances  mechanical failure of equipment  blowouts  cratering and fires  which could result in damage or injury to  or destruction of  formations  producing facilities or other property  or could result in personal injuries  loss of life or pollution of the environment 
any such event could result in substantial loss to the company that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
in and  the company experienced mechanical failures of downhole equipment at the company s south timbalier block well 
as a result of these equipment failures  the well was shut in for approximately two months in and one month in  and the company incurred significant repair costs 
see business and properties significant properties and activities south timbalier block although such operational risks and hazards may to some extent be minimized  no combination of experience  knowledge and scientific evaluation can eliminate the risk of investment or assure a profit to any company engaged in oil and gas operations 
additional factors 
additional factors that could cause actual events to vary from those discussed above and elsewhere in this annual report include  among others loss of key company personnel  adverse change in governmental regulation  inability to obtain critical supplies and equipment  personnel and consultants  and inability to access capital to pursue the company s plans
