seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  including small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  truck  parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the third and fourth quarters 
the company has historically received benefits from volume purchases and meeting vendor sales targets in the form of cash rebates  which are typically recognized when received 
approximately of such rebates are typically received in the fourth quarter  resulting in a seasonal increase in gross profit 
seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
as the company s construction equipment dealership is located in houston  texas  where winters are mild  seasonality currently does not have a material effect on the company s construction equipment business 
additionally  any seasonal effects  resulting from future acquisitions  on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors  for both residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
cyclicality the company s business  as well as the entire retail heavy duty truck industry  is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
although industry wide domestic retail sales of heavy duty trucks exceeded  units for the first time in according to rl polk  new order volume declined toward the end of that year and the industry recorded approximately  new truck registrations in the industry forecasts an increase of approximately in heavy duty new truck sales in although the company believes that its geographic expansion and diversification into truck related services  including financial services  leasing  rentals and service and parts  will reduce the overall impact to the company resulting from general economic conditions affecting heavy duty truck sales  the company s operations may be materially and adversely affected by any continuation or renewal of general downward economic pressures or adverse cyclical trends 
year the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent on its computer software programs and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
these programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including information management services and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company has been evaluating its programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems  as well as manual processes  external interfaces with customers  and services supplied by vendors to coordinate year compliance and conversion 
the year problem refers to the limitations of the programming code in certain existing software programs to recognize date sensitive information for the year and beyond 
unless modified prior to the year  such systems may not properly recognize such information and could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail to operate properly 
based on current information  the company expects to attain year compliance and institute appropriate testing of its modifications and replacements in a timely fashion and in advance of the year date change 
it is anticipated that modification or replacement of the company s programs and systems will be performed in house by company personnel 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year problem will not pose a significant operational problem for the company 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computers may not interface properly with the company s computer systems 
the company could be adversely affected by the year problem if it or unrelated parties fail to successfully address this issue 
management of the company currently anticipates that the expenses and capital expenditures associated with its year compliance project will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate inflation over the last few years has not had a significant impact on the company s revenue or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effect on the sales of its products  although there can be no assurance that such an effect will not occur in the future
