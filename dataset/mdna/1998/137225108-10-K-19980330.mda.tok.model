liquidity  capital resources and changes in financial condition december  compared to december  as of december   fountain had current assets of us  of which us  was in the form of cash and cash equivalents and us  was in the form of restricted cash  and current liabilities of us  leaving fountain with working capital of us  this compares to current assets of us  cash and cash equivalents of us  current liabilities of us  and working capital of us  as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from december  through december  is attributable primarily to us  of cash used in investing activities  primarily us  of investments in and advances to oil and gas properties and ventures and an additional us  of restricted cash deposits collateralizing letters of credit issued by banks to guarantee repayment of obligations by oil and gas ventures  and us  of cash utilized in operating activities  including us  of general and administrative expenses that were largely cash items 
the decrease in current assets attributable to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by the classification of us  of restricted cash at december  as a current asset in light of fountain s expectation that the restricted cash would be either applied to satisfy accrued liabilities or released from restrictions during other current assets increased from us  at december  to us  at december  primarily as a result of a us  increase in prepaid expenses  largely relating to lease and consulting obligations  and a us  increase in miscellaneous receivables  substantially offset by a us  reduction in inventory 
during the fourth quarter of  fountain commenced a program to preserve its financial resources by reducing general and administrative expenses and limiting its investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures and properties in which it holds interests  while it explored and pursued strategic alternatives with the assistance of investment advisors 
as a result of its consideration of strategic alternatives  fountain entered into the combination agreement in february consummation of the transaction with canargo is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions  including approval of the business combination by the stockholders of canargo and fountain 
as part of its program to preserve financial resources  fountain has terminated or delivered termination notices to approximately three quarters of its employees  each of whom is expected to cease employment by july  the rate at which fountain utilizes cash in the ordinary conduct of business is expected to decrease substantially during as compared to  at least prior to the consummation of the transaction 
cash expenses associated with the transaction  principally fees to financial advisors and legal counsel  are however expected to amount to approximately  most of which will be incurred prior to the consummation of the transaction 
the sharp reduction in fountain s workforce will make it significantly more difficult for fountain to function as an independent entity if the transaction does not occur 
the us  increase in current liabilities is attributable to a us  increase in accrued liabilities  which in turn is based primarily on an us  accrual associated with the impairment of the lelyaky field oil and gas venture 
the accrual includes us  of debt and accrued interest of kashtan  on which kashtan has defaulted or is expected to default and which was effectively guaranteed by fountain through restricted cash deposits of us  and us  of estimated liabilities for severance and related costs associated with closing down kashtan operations 
such costs are expected to be paid during in  fountain placed an additional us  in a restricted deposit account to collateralize letters of credit used for the benefit of oil and gas ventures in which fountain holds interests  increasing the balance from us  at december  to us  at december  based on fountain s expectation that the restricted cash would be either applied to satisfy accrued liabilities or released from restrictions during the twelve months following december   restricted cash was classified as a current asset as of december  notes receivable of us  as of december  representing obligations of an entity that had sold to fountain shares of uk ran  the subsidiary through which fountain holds its interest in kashtan  were written off during to reflect doubtful collectability 
property and equipment decreased us  during  from us  at december  to us  at december  drilling rigs and related equipment originally intended for use in the maykop field project  with a carrying value of us  at december  represented substantially all of the property and equipment at the end of both and fountain shipped the rigs and equipment from the united states in december  but when intergas  the entity developing the maykop field  failed to complete various corporate formalities believed by fountain to be necessary for the efficient and economical importation of the rigs and equipment into adygea  the shipment was diverted to cyprus where the rigs and equipment remain in bonded storage 
during  an additional us  was invested in the drilling rigs and related equipment  particularly in the equipment category 
because of the very substantial delays it has experienced in resolving operating arrangements and other matters relating to intergas  fountain has concluded that under present circumstances it cannot effectively pursue commercial activities including the development of the maykop field through intergas 
since the drilling rigs and related equipment are expected to be employed for applications other than those for which they were specifically intended  fountain has written down the carrying value of the rigs and equipment by us  to us  at december  oil and gas properties  net  increased us  in  from us  at december  to us  at december  during  fountain acquired a majority interest in a heavy oil field located at sylvan lake  alberta  canada for us  in the same year  fountain recorded capitalized development costs  primarily related to the sylvan lake property  amounting to us  the additions to oil and gas properties  net  were partially offset by unit of production amortization expenses of us  and the impairment of the remaining carrying value of the rocksprings property  amounting to us  fountain expects during the second half of to install eeor equipment in the sylvan lake well drilled during this equipment is designed to provide thermal stimulation to the heavy oil reservoir by heating it electrically and is expected to cost approximately us  investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures net decreased during from us  at december  to us  at december  total investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures during aggregated us  of which us  including fountain common stock having a value of us  issued in connection with the acquisition of an interest in the stynawske field project was directed to the stynawske field project  us  was directed to the maykop field project  us  was directed to the gorisht kocul field project  and us  was directed to the lelyaky field project  which was funded during primarily through a bank line of credit supported by restricted cash deposits made by fountain 
investments in and advances to the stynawske field project will be the only significant investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures anticipated during prior to the consummation of the transaction 
during  fountain for varying reasons recognized impairment losses related to the lelyaky field  maykop field and gorisht kocul field projects 
impairment of oil and gas ventures aggregated us  which is in addition to aggregate losses of us  recorded in with respect to fountain s equity in the losses of kashtan  intergas and the gorisht kocul joint venture which operate those three projects  respectively 
a loss of us  was also recorded in with respect to fountain s equity in the loss of boryslaw oil company which operates the stynawske field 
based on its analysis of the results of the initial development efforts in the lelyaky field project  fountain concluded that the lelyaky field will not support a successful commercial development 
as a result  fountain recorded an impairment charge totaling us  the impairment charge consisted of us  representing the carrying value of an investment related to kashtan  us  of debt and accrued interest of kashtan on which kashtan has defaulted or is expected to default and which was effectively guaranteed by fountain through restricted cash deposits  and us  of estimated liabilities for severance and related costs associated with closing down kashtan s operation 
such costs are expected to be paid in in addition  fountain recognized a loss in of us  reflecting its equity in the loss of kashtan 
because it has experienced extended delays in resolving operating arrangements and other intergas matters including completion of corporate formalities  fountain has concluded that under present circumstances it cannot effectively pursue commercial activities and develop the maykop field through intergas 
as a result  fountain recorded during the fourth quarter of an impairment of us  for the entire amount of its investment in and advances to intergas 
in addition  in recognition that drilling rigs and related equipment originally intended for use in the maykop field are expected to be employed for applications other than those for which they were specifically intended  fountain wrote those rigs and equipment down to their estimated fair value 
during  fountain also recognized a us  loss with respect to its equity in the loss of intergas 
in march  fountain declared the political unrest in albania to be a force majeure with respect to the gorisht kocul project  and development efforts there have been suspended since the declaration 
in light of the extended period that the force majeure condition has continued and the absence of any indication of an imminent termination of that condition  fountain recognized at december  a us  impairment of oil and gas ventures  writing off its net investment in and advances to the joint venture developing the gorisht kocul field 
during  fountain also recognized a us  loss as its equity in the loss of that joint venture 
the remaining balance of us  in investment in and advances to oil and gas ventures net at december  relates solely to boryslaw oil company  the entity holding the license to develop the stynawske field 
fountain has the responsibility of arranging financing for this venture and  unless third party financing can be arranged  fountain might have to supply the capital to finance operations until the venture generates positive cash flow  which will have the effect of increasing investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures 
the amount of such advances may be greater than the amount of the operating losses recognized by fountain  which would cause such net investment balances to increase 
such investments are essentially unevaluated oil and gas properties  and such costs may not be recovered if the venture is not successful 
no assurance can be given that fountain will either be able to arrange third party financing for such venture or have sufficient resources to fund the capital and operating needs of the venture or that the venture will be successful 
other assets decreased from approximately from us  at december  to nil at december  primarily as a result of the application during of deposits placed by fountain related to oil and gas properties and ventures that were outstanding at december  and the write off in of fountain s us  investment in the entity that held a minority interest in uk ran  the subsidiary through which fountain held its interest in kashtan 
the write off of the investment is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as impairment of oil and gas ventures 
accounts payable decreased from us  at december  to us  at december   primarily as a result of the substantial reduction in project activity during the fourth quarter of  as fountain focused considerable attention on cash conservation 
accrued liabilities increased us  during  primarily as a result of accruals associated with the impairment of the lelyaky field project 
stockholders equity decreased us  in from us  at december  to us  primarily as a result of the us  net loss reported by fountain for  offset to a minor degree by issuances of common stock  primarily in connection with the acquisition of an interest in an oil and gas venture  which added us  to stockholders equity 
fountain has had and continues to have outstanding obligations with respect to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and ventures in which it has interests that require or may require fountain to expend funds and to issue shares of its common stock 
some of these obligations are subject to the satisfaction of various conditions related to  among other things  achievement of specified project performance standards 
at december   fountain had unconditional obligations regarding the acquisition and development of its oil and gas projects and ventures amounting to us  of which us  was being satisfied through the collateralization of letters of credit guaranteeing obligations of kashtan  as well as the unconditional obligation to issue  shares of its common stock 
during  fountain effectively discharged its obligations regarding the us  by  among other things  accruing for its obligation with respect to its effective guaranty of kashtan s indebtedness to a bank  and issued  shares of its common stock in satisfaction of unconditional obligations existing on december  as the result of the occurrence of a condition subsequent  fountain s obligation to issue the other  shares was terminated in on december   fountain also had contingent obligations relating to the acquisition and development of its oil and gas properties and ventures amounting to us  and  shares of common stock 
as of december   the conditions that would have required the payment of us  and the issuance of  shares of common stock could no longer be met or have become remote  so those conditional obligations were eliminated 
since no additional conditional or unconditional obligations to expend funds or issue shares in connection with the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and ventures were incurred in  at december  fountain had contingent obligations involving  shares which relate to development of the stynawske field project 
as fountain develops current projects and undertakes other projects  significant additional obligations may be incurred 
as a result of the events described above relating to kashtan  intergas and the gorisht kocul joint venture  fountain may be subject to contingent liabilities in the form of claims from those ventures and other participants therein 
fountain has been advised that intergas and another shareholder of intergas are considering asserting such claims 
fountain management is unable to estimate the range that such claims  if any  might total 
however  if any claims were determined to be valid  they could have a material adverse effect on fountain s financial position  result of operations and cash flows 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which fountain has interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
fountain had working capital of approximately us  at december   which it considered inadequate to proceed with full implementation of its program of developing its principal oil and gas properties and ventures 
full development of fountain s oil and gas properties and ventures will require the availability of substantial additional funds from external sources 
fountain believes that its ability to access external financing is dependent upon the successful completion of a business combination with  or the farm out of a significant portion of its interest in boc and possibly other properties and ventures to  an entity that can provide or attract such financing 
fountain generally has the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which it has an interest 
there can be no assurance  however  that fountain or the entities that are developing the oil and gas properties and ventures will be able to arrange the financing necessary to develop the projects being undertaken or to support the corporate and other activities of fountain or that such financing as is available will be on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of fountain  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 
as of december  and  fountain had net investments in oil and gas properties and ventures totaling approximately us  and us  respectively 
of these amounts  us  and us  respectively  relate to ventures in eastern europe 
ultimate realization of the carrying value of fountain s oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to fountain  which is dependent upon  among other factors  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation from local authorities  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
in addition  fountain must mobilize drilling equipment and personnel to initiate drilling  completion and production activities 
fountain has plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover its carrying value 
however  if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and fountain may not recover its carrying value 
fountain will be entitled to distributions from the various properties and ventures in accordance with the arrangements governing the respective properties and ventures 
in  fountain implemented new computer information systems  which fountain believes are year compliant 
although fountain does not expect to incur additional expenditures to address year issues  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
additionally  the ability of third parties with whom fountain transacts business to adequately address their year issues is outside of fountain s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of fountain or such third parties to adequately address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on fountain s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
december  compared to august  as of december   fountain had current assets of us  of which us  was in the form of cash and cash equivalents  and current liabilities of us  leaving fountain with working capital of us  this compares to current assets of us  cash and cash equivalents of us  current liabilities of us  and working capital of us  as of august  the increase in current assets  cash and cash equivalents and working capital from august  through december  was attributable primarily to issuance and sale of fountain common stock for cash upon exercise of stock purchase warrants  partially offset by investments in oil and gas ventures and operating losses 
during the four months ended december   fountain received approximately us  as a result of the exercise of outstanding stock purchase warrants that resulted in the issuance of  shares of fountain common stock 
as fountain entered  no further stock purchase warrants issued by fountain remained outstanding 
the cash proceeds from the exercise of the stock purchase warrants were partially offset during the four month period ended december  by i us  of cash which was restricted to collateralize letters of credit issued for the benefit of oil and gas ventures accounted for using the equity method  ii us  for investments in and advances to such oil and gas ventures  iii capital expenditures of us  on drilling rigs and related equipment which fountain had expected to transfer to intergas  and iv us  used in operating activities during the four months ended december  principally representing the cash portion of fountain s net loss for that period 
property and equipment  net increased from us  at august  to us  at december   reflecting the improvement of rigs and equipment acquired along with fountain s principal interest in intergas and the acquisition of additional equipment through december  investments in and advances to oil and gas ventures net increased from us  at august  to us  at december   reflecting fountain s increasing involvement in projects in eastern europe 
during the four months ended december   fountain entered into a joint venture to develop the stynawske field 
other assets increased from us  at august  to us  at december   primarily as a result of deposits placed by fountain on items related to oil and gas ventures 
accrued liabilities increased from us  at august  to us  at december  accrued liabilities principally reflected the accrual of salaries and related employment taxes and professional fees  and  at december   transportation charges associated with shipping drilling rigs and related equipment that were eventually placed in bonded storage in cyprus 
stockholders equity increased from us  at august  to us  at december   as a result of fountain s issuance and sale of equity securities  partially offset principally by operating losses 
as of december and august   fountain had net investments in oil and gas properties and ventures totaling us  and us  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately us  and us  respectively  related to the ventures in eastern europe 
ultimate realization of the cost of fountain s oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to fountain  which is dependent upon  among other factors  achieving significant increases in production from existing levels  production of oil and gas at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation from local authorities  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended august  fountain has typically acquired its interests in oil and gas properties through interests in joint ventures  partially owned corporate and other entities and joint operating arrangements 
while it has normally sought to be the operator of substantial oil and gas projects in which it has an interest  fountain has generally acquired interests representing or less of the equity in various oil and gas projects 
accordingly  most of the activities in which fountain has an interest are conducted through unconsolidated entities 
fountain s interest in the assets and liabilities of unconsolidated entities is reflected on fountain s consolidated balance sheet on a net basis as investment in and advances to oil and gas ventures  fountain s share of revenue  other income and expenses of unconsolidated entities is reported in fountain s consolidated statement of operations as income or loss from equity investment in oil and gas ventures  and fountain s interest in the cash flow of unconsolidated entities is reported in fountain s consolidated statement of cash flows as distributions from or investment in or advances to oil and gas ventures 
interests acquired in certain joint ventures  partnerships and production sharing  working interest and other arrangements are proportionately consolidated 
fountain will report the same stockholders equity and net income or loss whether it accounts for various oil and gas ventures using the equity method or on a consolidated basis 
fountain recorded operating revenue of us  during the year ended december  compared with us  for the year ended august  revenue in both years was related to a modest amount of oil and gas production from property in alberta  canada in which fountain has interests 
the production was generated primarily at the sylvan lake property in which fountain acquired an interest in the operating loss for the year ended december  amounted to us  compared with us  for the year ended august  the increase in the operating loss is attributable primarily to the impairment of oil and gas ventures  oil and gas properties  and property and equipment and other assets which aggregated us  in  as well as a us  loss representing fountain s equity in the loss of oil and gas ventures 
there were no comparable impairment charges in fiscal  and in that year  fountain s equity in the loss of oil and gas ventures was us  lease operating expenses increased to us  in  as compared to us  in fiscal  primarily as a result of fountain s acquisition of an interest in the sylvan lake property in early direct project costs increased us  from the us  experienced during the fiscal year ended august   reflecting principally the higher level of project activity and the inability of fountain to recoup from kashtan certain expenses related to the lelyaky field project incurred during december general and administrative expenses in the years ended december  and august  were comparable 
general and administrative expense are expected to decrease during  at least prior to the consummation of the transaction 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from us  in the year ended august  to us  in the year ended december  is attributable principally to the increased production of oil 
during the year ended december   fountain recognized an aggregate of us  in losses as a result of the impairment of long lived assets  as compared to an impairment loss of us  for the year ended august  impairment of the ventures operating the lelyaky  maykop and gorisht kocul field projects resulted in a combined loss of us  the impairment of drilling rigs and related equipment originally intended to be utilized in the maykop field project and certain office furniture  fixtures and equipment resulted in a loss of us  the remaining investment in the rocksprings property  which was carried in fountain s december  balance sheet as a us  unevaluated oil and gas property was recognized as impaired in the remaining assets impaired during were notes receivable from the entity that sold to fountain its principal interest in kashtan  as to which there were doubts regarding collectability 
in  fountain recorded total other income of us  as compared to total other expense of us  in the year ended august  interest income increased to us  for the year ended december  from us  for the year ended august  due to higher average cash and cash equivalent investments 
interest expense decreased from us  for the year ended august   when fountain recorded amortization of financing costs  discount and interest related to the convertible subordinated fountain debentures  to us  for calendar in both and fiscal  fountain recorded losses from the sale of miscellaneous equipment and property amounting to us  and us  respectively 
the net loss of us  or us per share  in compares to a net loss of us  or us 
per share  in the fiscal year ended august  the disproportionate losses per share are attributable to fountain s issuance of additional shares subsequent to august   resulting in a substantially higher weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year ended december  four months ended december  compared with four months ended december  fountain recorded an operating loss of us  during the four month period ended december  compared with us  for the same period 
the increased loss resulted from an increase of approximately us  of equity loss from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily associated with the activities of the oil and gas ventures in eastern europe in which fountain has interests 
general and administrative expenses for the four month period ended december  amounted to us  reflecting a modest decrease from the us  for the comparable period 
for the period  general and administrative costs included a charge for external services for public relations activities of a non recurring nature 
the decrease in the period for such expense was substantially offset by increases in salaries and other administrative costs related to the build up of staff associated with the projects in eastern europe 
general and administrative expense is net of us  and us  capitalized pursuant to full cost accounting rules during the four month period ended december  and  respectively 
interest income increased to us  for the four month period ended december  from us  in the comparable period for the prior year due to higher average cash investments 
interest expense increased to us  for the four month period ended december  from us  in the comparable period for the prior year due to the amortization of financing costs and interest related to the fountain debentures and financing of insurance premiums 
twelve months ended august  compared with twelve months ended august  fountain recorded operating revenue of us  during the year ended august  compared with us  for the year ended august  the decrease in revenue resulted from a decline in sale of eeor equipment 
fountain decided not to market the eeor technology to third parties but rather to use the technology primarily as a competitive advantage to secure new heavy oil interests and  assuming successful commercialization  to optimize production and reserves from such interests 
consequently while all us  of revenue related to eeor technology  only us  of revenue was associated with the eeor technology 
most revenue was related to a modest amount of oil and gas production from an overriding royalty interest held by fountain relating to property in alberta  canada 
the operating loss for the year ended august  amounted to us  compared with us  for the year ended august  the reduction in the operating loss was attributable primarily to non recurring expense items relating to the impairment of patent rights and certain other assets written off at the end of fiscal  the amortization of those patent rights during  and financial public relations expenses paid primarily by the issuance of fountain common stock  partially offset by higher direct project costs of us  and general and administrative expense other than those related to financial public relations associated with the development of an organization and infrastructure for fountain s oil and gas activities 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended august  amounted to us  compared to us  for the year ended august  for the period  general and administrative costs included a substantial charge for external services fees for financial public relations activities of a non recurring nature 
the decrease in the financial public relations expense was substantially offset by increases in salaries and other administrative costs related to the build up of staff associated with the projects in eastern europe 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense decreased from us  in fiscal  to us  for fiscal this reduction was attributable primarily to the recognition at august  of the impairment of intangible assets on which amortization had been charged at the rate of approximately us  per quarter during fiscal during fiscal  fountain recognized an impairment of us  on its oil and gas properties as a result of applying the full cost ceiling limitation 
of this amount  us  related to fountain s investment in the rocksprings project in west texas 
as of august   the rocksprings field had only produced insignificant amounts of gas from one of the two wells in which fountain participated 
during fiscal year  fountain recognized us  of impairment expense on the same project 
as of august   fountain had a us  unevaluated oil and gas property on its balance sheet related to the rocksprings project 
the remaining expense associated with impairment of oil and gas properties related to fountain s working interest in the west mexia field  which involved a now abandoned experimental well to test new technology for determining the remaining predictable oil between wells and in wells that had become early water producers 
during  fountain recorded a loss of us  from the sale of certain drilling equipment 
interest income increased to us  for the year ended august  from us  in the prior year due to higher average cash investments 
interest expense increased to us  for the year ended august  from us  in the prior year due to the amortization of financing costs  discount and interest related to the fountain debentures 
forward looking statements the forward looking statements contained in this item and elsewhere in this form k are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward looking statements 
included among the important risks  uncertainties and other factors are those hereinafter discussed 
few of such forward looking statements deal with matters that are within the unilateral control of the company 
joint venture  acquisition  financing and other agreements and arrangements must be negotiated with independent third parties and  in some cases  must be approved by governmental agencies 
such third parties generally have interests that do not coincide with those of the company and may conflict with the company s interests 
unless the company and such third parties are able to compromise their respective objectives in a mutually acceptable manner  agreements and arrangements will not be consummated 
operating entities in various foreign jurisdictions must be registered by governmental agencies  and production licenses for development of oil and gas fields in various foreign jurisdictions must be granted by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies generally have broad discretion in determining whether to take or approve various actions and matters 
in addition  the policies and practices of governmental agencies may be affected or altered by political  economic and other events occurring either within their own countries or in a broader international context 
it is anticipated that the company will not have a majority of the equity in the entity that would be the licensed developer of any of the projects that the company is presently pursuing in eastern europe  even though the company may be the designated operator of the oil or gas field 
thus  the concurrence of co venturers may be required for various actions 
other parties influencing the timing of events may have priorities that differ from those of the company  even if they generally share the company s objectives 
as a result of all of the foregoing  among other matters  the forward looking statements regarding the occurrence and timing of future events may well anticipate results that will not be realized 
the availability of equity financing to the company or debt financing to the company and the joint venture or other entities that are developing the projects is affected by  among other things  world economic conditions  international relations  the stability and policies of various governments  fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and the outlook for the oil and gas industry  the competition for funds and an evaluation of specific company projects 
rising interest rates might affect the feasibility of debt financing that is offered 
potential investors and lenders will be influenced by their evaluations of the company and its projects and comparisons with alternative investment opportunities 
the company s ability to finance all of its present oil and gas projects according to present plans is dependent upon obtaining additional funding 
the development of oil and gas properties is subject to substantial risks 
expectations regarding production  even if estimated by independent petroleum engineers  may prove to be unrealized 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating production quantities and in projecting future production rates and the timing and amount of future development expenditures 
estimates of properties in full production are more reliable than production estimates for new discoveries and other properties that are not fully productive 
accordingly  estimates related to the company s properties are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
most of the company s interests in oil and gas ventures are located in eastern european countries 
operations in those countries are subject to certain additional risks relating to  among other things  enforceability of contracts  currency convertibility and transferability  unexpected changes in tax rates  availability of trained personnel  availability of equipment and services and other factors that could significantly change the economics of production 
production estimates are subject to revision as prices and costs change 
production  even if present  may not be recoverable in the amount and at the rate anticipated and may not be recoverable in commercial quantities or on an economically feasible basis 
world and local prices for oil and gas can fluctuate significantly  and a reduction in the revenue realizable from the sale of production can affect the economic feasibility of an oil and gas project 
world and local political  economic and other conditions could affect the company s ability to proceed with or to effectively operate projects in various foreign countries 
demands by or expectations of governments  co venturers  customers and others may affect the company s strategy regarding the various projects 
failure to meet such demands or expectations could adversely affect the company s participation in such projects or its ability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses and other approvals
