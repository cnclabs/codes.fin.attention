costs and expenses cost of sales  as a percent of sales  were   and  respectively  in   and in  the increase in the cost of sales percentage was due primarily to increased competition and lower margin contracts resulting from contracts in which the company was functioning as the prime contractor 
as forecast last year  this trend is expected to continue to reduce overall gross margins in and beyond 
in  the decrease in the cost of sales percentage was due primarily to product mix and  in part  to the company wide restructuring that occurred in and which eliminated non profitable product lines and included a write down of inventory

however  high levels of research and development will continue in support of essential product development to ensure that the company maintains technical excellence and market competitiveness 
the company continues to fund substantially all research and development costs internally 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  was million of expense in and million of income in this change was due primarily to a write down of the company s investments in certain marketable and non marketable securities of million during there were no gains from sales of investment securities in compared to a million gain in in addition  interest income decreased million in compared to million in 
in  other income  net  decreased million compared to million in due primarily to a lower gain on sale of investment securities million versus million in and a decrease in interest income million versus million in

at the end of  there were no material capital commitments 
the company believes that through internal cash generation  plus its cash equivalents  marketable securities and available borrowings under its line of credit agreements  it has sufficient resources to cover its cash needs during fiscal year effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years   and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year the year issue beginning in  evans sutherland initiated the review and assessment of all its computerized hardware and internal use software systems in order to ensure that such systems will function properly in the year and beyond 
during the last two years  the company s computerized information systems have been substantially replaced and are believed to be year compliant 
it is possible  however  that software programs acquired from third parties and incorporated into other applications utilized by the company may not be fully year compliant 
e s intends to continue testing  replacing  or enhancing its internal applications through the end of to ensure that risks related to such software are minimized 
management does not believe that costs associated with year compliance efforts will have a material impact on the company s financial results or operations 
outlook looking forward  the company expects good revenue and earnings growth in the biggest challenge facing the company is maintaining gross margin levels  especially in the government business where continuing worldwide pressure on defense budgets is severe and in contracts in which the company functions as the prime contractor 
these pressures are expected to be partially offset by continued profit improvement in the company s new businesses 
new product startup expenses are expected to continue to depress earnings in the first quarter of with anticipated recovery as new products enter volume production 
an important indicator for the company is its continued strong performance in winning new orders 
record bookings in of over million resulted in a record year end backlog of million  most of which is expected to be converted to revenue in the company s investments in internal infrastructure is also beginning to produce results  contributing to an increase in productivity of in as measured by revenue per employee 
in addition  order fulfillment time was reduced  resulting in improvements in on time deliveries to customers 
the complete reengineering of supply chain processes contributed to this improvement  as well as to improved inventory turns and overall product quality 
corporate development activities  including mergers  acquisitions  and strategic investments  continue to be an important part of the company s strategic growth plan 
the foregoing contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to quarterly fluctuations in results  the timely availability and customer acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  general market trends and conditions  and other risks detailed below in factors that may affect future results 
actual results may vary materially from projected results 
factors that may affect future results evans sutherland s domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
while e s management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating its growth outlook 
overview the high tech nature of the company s business is subject to both national and worldwide economic and political influences such as recession  political instability  the economic strength of governments  and rapid changes in technology 
the company s operating results are dependent on its ability to rapidly develop  manufacture  and market innovative products that meet customers needs 
inherent in this process is a number of risks that the company must manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex  expensive  and uncertain  requiring innovative designs and features that anticipate customer needs  competing solutions  and technological trends 
the products  once developed  must be manufactured and distributed in sufficient volumes and quality at acceptable costs and competitive prices 
furthermore  portions of the manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver high quality components and subassemblies in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
constraints in these supply lines and insufficient quality could adversely affect the company s operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
competitive environment the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
as most areas in which e s operates continue to grow  the company is experiencing increased competition  and it expects this trend to continue 
in recent years  domestic and worldwide political  economic  and technological developments have strongly affected these markets  requiring adaptation by market participants 
since  e s has followed a three point growth strategy  consisting of growing existing businesses  developing new businesses internally  and selectively acquiring businesses 
these strategies have broadened the company s business portfolio  creating opportunities for increased efficiency and market competitiveness  improved access to new markets  and reduced exposure to airline industry and defense budget reductions 
in addition  e s continues to undertake cost reduction efforts throughout all business units while monitoring and adjusting employment levels consistent with changing business requirements 
evans sutherland s executive management and board of directors continue to review and monitor the company s strategic plans in connection with its three point growth strategy 
these plans include assessing business combinations and joint ventures with companies engaged in similar or closely related businesses  building market share in core businesses  and divesting less well positioned and non core businesses to remain competitive 
period to period fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
delivery cycles and contract lengths are typically long for its core simulation related businesses  which make up the largest share of the company s revenues and earnings 
well over half of each quarter s revenues result from orders booked in previous quarters 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a small revenue shortfall or shift may cause a period s results to be below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including delays in the availability of products  delays from chip suppliers  discontinuance of key components from suppliers  other supply constraints  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  or natural disasters 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale commercial or government contracts may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
us and international government defense budgets may require the company to delay or even cancel production due to lack of available funding 
gross margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations  including the mix of lower margin prime contracts versus sub contracts  new products and markets versus established products and markets  the mix of high end products versus low end products  as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
future margins may not duplicate historical margins or growth rates 
the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
research and development e s commits a significant investment in long term research and development 
developing new products and software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle 
while the company has every reason to believe these investments will ultimately be rewarded with revenue generating products  customer acceptance ultimately dictates the success of development and marketing efforts 
the company plans to continue significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities from which significant revenue is not anticipated for a number of years 
management expects total spending for research and development in to increase over spending in in absolute dollars  but not to increase as a percentage of sales 
product development and introduction the company s continued success depends on its ability to develop technologically complex and innovative products 
product transitions are a recurring part of the company s business 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
during fiscal  for example  the company is heavily committed to meeting delivery schedules for its harmony and integrator products 
while e s has every expectation to meet these schedules  the company has customer contracts that include liquidated damages if delivery schedules are not met 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of a new product requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within the company as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components  such as chipsets 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause the company s new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that the company establishes 
as the variety and complexity of the company s product families increase  the process of planning production and inventory levels also becomes increasingly complex 
in addition  the extent to which a new product gains rapid acceptance is strongly affected by the availability of key applications optimized for the new systems 
there is no assurance that acceptance of the company s new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
product life cycles place a premium on evans sutherland s ability to manage the transition from current products to new products 
the company may announce new products  while the product is in the final stages of development 
the company s results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products late to manufacturing  quality or yield problems experienced by production or suppliers  variations in product costs  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new products  and excess inventories of older products and components 
us government contracts in  of the company s sales were made to agencies of the us government  either directly or through prime contractors or subcontractors  for which there is intense competition 
accordingly  a significant portion of the company s sales are subject to inherent risks  including uncertainty of economic conditions  changes in government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments  and the availability of funds 
these risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and dependence on annual congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in the past  some of the company s programs have been delayed  curtailed  or terminated 
although e s cannot predict such uncertainties  in the opinion of management there are no spending reductions or funding limitations pending that would impact company contracts 
other characteristics of the industry are complexity of designs  the difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work  and the rapidity with which product lines become obsolete due to technological advances and other factors characteristic of the industry 
earnings may vary materially on some contracts depending upon the types of government long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  and the achievement of other performance objectives 
due to the intense competition for available us government business  maintaining or expanding government business increasingly requires e s to commit additional working capital for long term programs and additional investments in company funded research and development 
as a us government contractor or sub contractor  evans sutherland s contracts and operations are subject to government oversight 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of the company s business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting 
these investigations may lead to claims against the company 
under us government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts  a conviction could result in debarment for a specified period of time 
although the outcome of such investigations and inquiries cannot be predicted  in the opinion of management there are no claims  audits  or investigations pending against e s that are likely to have a material adverse effect on either the company s business or its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international business evans sutherland s international business accounted for of the company s sales 
international business involves additional risks  such as exposure to currency fluctuations and changes in foreign economic and political environments  such as those currently affecting asian markets 
international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from stringent contractual terms and conditions and widely differing legal systems  customs  and mores in foreign countries 
in addition  international sales often include sales to various foreign government armed forces  with many of the same inherent risks associated with us government sales identified above 
e s expects that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of the company s overall business in the foreseeable future 
commercial airline business the company s commercial simulation airline business has strengthened since its decision in to pursue a new strategy of supplying complete systems instead of just components 
characteristics of the commercial simulation market include uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence upon the strength of the commercial airline industry  air pilot training requirements  competition  timely performance by subcontractors on contracts in which e s is the prime contractor  and changes in technology 
new businesses as e s develops and grows its new businesses  there are certain uncertainties and risks associated with each business unit 
these risks include a developing strong partner relationships with board manufacturers  as well as intense competitive pressures for the desktop graphics business  b acceptance of new technology and increasing market size and demand in a developing new market for the digital theater business  c the technical feasibility and uncertain market acceptance in a developing new market for the digital studio business  and d changes in technology and intense competition for the board products business 
risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  uncertainty of economic conditions  commitment of working capital  market acceptance  and other risks inherent in new businesses 
private finance initiative the private finance initiative pfi is designed to increase the involvement of the private sector in the provision of services which have traditionally been provided by the public sector 
pfi requires the private sector to use its own capital to invest in assets which then are used to provide a long term service such as simulation training to its public sector customer 
the number of programs being developed as pfis is increasing worldwide 
e s is currently involved in proposals to international military customers where it would be an equity partner of the pfi prime contractor and program manager 
pfi programs  however  are subject to inherent risks  including the commitment of working capital and fixed assets  long cycles in which to receive a return on investment  and termination or default of contracts 
these risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  uncertainty of economic conditions  changes in us and international government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments  and the availability of funds 
forward looking statements this annual report contains both historical facts and forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  commercialization  technology  and other risks detailed in this filing 
although the company believes it has the product offerings and resources for continuing success  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted 
factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the foregoing factors  recent trends are not necessarily reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial performance
