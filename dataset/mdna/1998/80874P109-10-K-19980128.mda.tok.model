the systems utilize high volume  real time transaction and data processing networks managed by central computers  communications equipment  special purpose microcomputer based terminals  peripheral and display equipment and operations and applications software 
the type of central processing unit and the number of ticket issuing terminals used in a system are generally determined by the amount of wagering at  and physical layout of  the facility 
ticket issuing terminals are installed at several different racetracks or off track facilities  respectively  and the central processing system communicates with the wagering systems at the on track locations via telephone or data communication lines 
the company generally does not  however  employ the clerks who issue wagering tickets using the company s teller operated terminals

minimum fees under the company s service contracts are generally based on the number of days the facility operates  as well as other factors  including the type of system and number of terminals installed at the facility 
in addition to payments received for wagering which takes place at a location where the company operates a wagering system  the company also typically receives an interface fee of for wagers that are made from remote sites on a race that is occurring at a racetrack where the company operates the wagering system 
this interface fee is charged and typically collected from the remote site where the wager is placed whether or not such site is a customer of the company 
as intertrack and off track wagering has increased  the percentage of total north american racing industry handle on which interface fees are charged has grown 
in recent years  the company has focused on the creation of regional networks of large and medium sized racetracks  rather than single facilities at smaller racetracks 
these networks allow the company to achieve economies of scale by centralizing its service operations and more efficiently utilizing its installed base of computer hardware 
additionally  when linked to the company s other regional and national pari mutuel wagering networks  these networks provide the company s customers with access to new markets and revenue sources by increasing the number and variety of wagering opportunities that customers can offer to their patrons 
the company believes the creation of these regional networks has  in part  been responsible for the company s increase in market share from less than in to approximately of the estimated total north american racing industry handle in additionally  the company believes its established wagering networks will give the company a competitive advantage in renewing existing contracts and winning new contracts in regions where such networks exist because of the company s ability to offer customers greater services more efficiently than its competitors 
the company currently operates its regional pari mutuel wagering networks in california  connecticut  florida  illinois  louisiana  michigan  new york  oregon  pennsylvania  washington  west virginia  puerto rico  alberta  british columbia and ontario

connecticut otb in  the company purchased from the state of connecticut the exclusive right to operate substantially all off track betting within the state 
since the company commenced operating the connecticut otb  it has implemented several important product and service enhancements  including expanded simulcasting from racetracks across the country  common pool wagering  seven day per week operations at seven locations and expanded telephone betting 
these improvements have helped increase the connecticut otb handle from approximately million in fiscal  when the state of connecticut last operated the connecticut otb  to approximately million in fiscal the company believes its expertise developed in operating the connecticut otb provides it with a competitive advantage in obtaining future otbs through privatization 
the company currently operates connecticut otb locations statewide  including two simulcasting teletheaters in new haven and windsor locks  three similcasting branches and a telephone account betting operation in new haven 
the company s approximately  square feet bradley teletheater in windsor locks features simulcasts of racing events  dining facilities and other services 
during fiscal  the company opened the approximately  square feet new haven sports  simulcasting and entertainment complex called sports haven r which features pari mutuel wagering on thoroughbred  harness  greyhound and jai alai events shown live on large screens and televisions throughout the facility 
since its opening  wagering in new haven has increased from approximately million to million annually 
the exclusive right to operate the connecticut otb is subject to state regulations with respect to such matters as the location of otbs  hours of operation and certain financial and operational standards 
the company must pay liquidated damages to the state if these standards are not met 
the company is also subject to a pari mutuel tax of of all monies wagered 
the percentage of the total handle which the company may receive as the operating revenues from the connecticut otb is determined by the track where the event is held and ranges from to  depending on the racetrack and type of wagers 
the company believes operation of the connecticut otb further strengthens its competitive position in attracting certain new racetrack customers to the extent that the connecticut otb does not already accept wagers for such racetrack s racing events 
the company can enhance a proposal for its services by offering the racetrack the opportunity to have its racing events wagered upon at the connecticut otb 
in return  racetracks generally receive between and of pari mutuel wagers as a payment 
in  the company received legislative approval to expand its operations to seven days a week subject to local approval 
currently seven connecticut otb locations operate seven days a week 
in june  the state of connecticut passed legislation authorizing the company to simulcast live racing events in up to six locations 
the company simulcasts at its bradley teletheater and sports haven r locations as well as at its branches in new britain  bristol and hartford 
such legislation also authorized racetracks and jai alai frontons within connecticut to retain a larger portion of the handle from pari mutuel pools 
the connecticut otb typically retains the same amount as the racetrack or fronton where the event is held 
as a result  the company believes that  to the extent that the racetracks and jai alai frontons increase the amounts that they retain  the company s gross profit will be positively affected 
during fiscal  the company estimates that patrons wagered approximately million at the connecticut otb on races and jai alai events which took place within connecticut

simulcasting provides racetracks the opportunity to increase revenues by sending their signals to as many wagering locations as possible  such as other racetracks  otbs and casinos 
sending live audio and video broadcasts of remote racing events generates increased revenues for other parts of the company and its customers by i increasing the consumer base for the remote events and ii maximizing the number of events available to a patron for wagering by utilizing idle time between races at racetracks to broadcast remote events 
in its simulcasting operations  the company leases satellite transponders and uses digital compression technology to increase the number of events which may be simulcasted at one time 
the company also owns vehicles which uplink the video and audio signals of racetrack and jai alai events to company controlled satellite transponders and owns decoders which are used by otbs and intertrack wagering facilities to unscramble the transmission signal from other racetracks 
in general  the company receives fees as follows i a daily fee charged to racetracks for the broadcast transmission services  including the uplink vehicle  operator and the use of satellite time controlled by the company  and ii a fee charged to receiving sites for the use of the company s decoders to unscramble the transmission feed of other racetracks 
in addition  the company often sells excess satellite transponder capacity to other users of satellite communications outside the racing industry 
from time to time  the company sells such excess capacity under long term contracts

the company currently has installed approximately  probe xlc terminals in two racetracks in west virginia  for which it receives a percentage of income generated by the terminals

contracts have a high dollar value and are technically and commercially complex and may require substantial initial cash outlays 
start up costs associated with contract awards typically involve expenditures for items such as software development customization  assembly of wagering systems  and installation costs including electrical and carpentry work  transportation and placement of equipment  and system implementation 
such costs are primarily comprised of labor related expenses due to the relative magnitude of software development and customization in the start up phase 
in the united states  lottery authorities generally commence the contract award process by issuing a request for proposals inviting bids and proposals from various lottery vendors 
internationally  lottery authorities do not typically utilize such a formal bidding process  but rather negotiate proposals with one or more potential vendors 
the company s contracts for the provision of pari mutuel services are typically for terms of five years 
contracts representing    and of the company s annual pari mutuel service revenues are scheduled to expire in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s contract to operate the connecticut state lottery has been renewed for five years with five one year renewal options 
the company historically has been successful in renewing its largest contracts as they have come due for renewal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to renew pari mutuel systems operating contracts with its largest customers or to further renew the lottery contract with the state of connecticut  and  if it is unable to do so  there would be a material adverse effect on the company 
service and support the company s staff of approximately persons  including regional and national managers and trained maintenance and field service personnel  supports the operation of the company s systems and communications networks 
the company s personnel support its systems by performing routine system maintenance and repairs of systems and equipment when needed

in addition  limited production of certain product lines is performed at the company s manufacturing facility in ballymahon  ireland 
other manufacturing is contracted out to third party vendors  as needed 
the company normally has sufficient lead time between reaching an agreement to serve a wagering facility and commencing actual operations at such facility 
in the event the current suppliers of central processing units were no longer available  the company believes that it would be able to adapt its application software to hardware available from other sources within a time frame sufficient to allow it to meet new contractual obligations  although the price competitiveness of the company s products might diminish 
the lead time for obtaining most of the electronic components used by the company is approximately days 
the company believes that this is consistent with its competitors lead times and is also consistent with the needs of its customers 
competition a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated from pari mutuel wagering on racing events at racetracks and otbs 
the market for pari mutuel wagering is competitive  and certain of the company s competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company competes primarily on the basis of design  performance  reliability and pricing of its products as well as customer service 
to effectively compete  the company expects to make continued investments in product development and or acquisitions of technology 
as new wagering products are developed  the racing industry may experience increased competition for wagers 
competition for wagers also comes from casino gaming  which has continued to expand  and other forms of legal and illegal gambling

competition in the simulcasting business in north america currently is fragmented 
other than the company  only roberts television international  inc has achieved a significant share of the market 
the on line lottery business is also highly competitive 
state and foreign governments normally award contracts based on competitive bidding procedures 
significant factors which influence the award of lottery contracts include price  the ability to optimize lottery revenues through marketing capability and applications knowledge  the quality  dependability and upgrade capability of the network  the experience  financial condition and reputation of the vendor  and the satisfaction of other requirements and qualifications which the lottery authority may impose 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve the technological advances necessary  have the financial resources or otherwise have the ability to effectively compete in this market 
the company s principal competitors in the on line lottery business are gtech holdings corp 
and pti  through its subsidiary automated wagering  inc the market for the company s products is affected by changing technology  new legislation and evolving industry standards 
the company s ability to anticipate such changes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in the company s ability to expand  remain competitive  attract new customers and retain existing contracts

video gaming coin or voucher operated gambling devices offering electronic  video versions of slots  poker  black jack and similar games are known as vgms  video lottery terminals vlts or slot machines  depending on the jurisdiction 
these devices represent a growing area in the wagering industry 
the company or its subsidiaries manufacture and supply terminals and wagering systems designed for use as vgms  vlts or slot machines 
twenty four states and puerto rico authorize wagering on vgms  vlts or slot machines at casinos  riverboats  racetracks and or other licensed facilities 
although some states  such as rhode island and west virginia  currently restrict vgms or vlts to already existing wagering facilities  others permit these devices to be placed at bars and restaurants as well 
several indian tribes throughout the united states are also authorized to operate these devices on reservation lands 
in addition  several canadian provinces and various foreign countries have authorized their use 
government officials in other states are considering proposals to legalize or expand video gaming  video lottery or slot machines in their states 
legislators have been enthusiastic about the potential of video gaming to raise significant additional revenues 
some officials  however  are reluctant to expand gaming industry opportunities or have expressed a desire to limit video gaming to established wagering facilities if video gaming is authorized in their jurisdiction at all 
companies that manufacture  sell or distribute vgms  vlts or slot machines are subject to various provincial  state  county and municipal laws and regulations 
the primary purposes of these rules are i to insure the responsibility  financial stability and character of equipment manufacturers and their key personnel and stockholders through licensing requirements  ii to insure the integrity and randomness of the machines  and iii to prohibit the use of vgms  vlts or slot machines at unauthorized locations or for the benefit of undesirable individuals or entities 
the regulations governing vgms  vlts and slot machines generally resemble the pari mutuel and sports wagering regulations in all the basic elements described above 
however  every jurisdiction has differing terminal design and operational requirements  and terminals generally must be certified by local regulatory authorities before being distributed in any particular jurisdiction 
these requirements may require the company or its subsidiaries to modify its terminals to some degree in order to achieve certification in particular locales 
in addition  the intrastate movement of such devices in a jurisdiction where they will be used by the general public is usually allowed only upon prior notification and or approval of the relevant regulatory authorities 
west virginia has licensed the company or its subsidiaries to supply vlts to authorized locations in that state 
the company intends to apply for all necessary licenses in other jurisdictions that may now or in the future authorize video gaming industry  video lottery or slot machine operations 
the company cannot predict the nature of the regulatory schemes or the terminal requirements that will be adopted in any of these jurisdictions  nor whether the company or any subsidiaries can obtain any required licenses and equipment certifications or will be found suitable 
federal law also affects the company s video gaming industry activities 
the federal gambling devices act of the devices act makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture  deliver or receive gambling devices  including vgms  vlts and slot machines  across interstate lines unless that person has first registered with the attorney general of the united states  or to transport such devices into jurisdictions where their possession is not specifically authorized by state law 
the devices act permits states to exempt themselves from its prohibition on transportation  and several states that authorize the manufacture or use of such devices within their jurisdictions have done so 
certain of the company s products  such as the probe xlc terminal  are gaming devices subject to the devices act and state laws governing such devices 
the devices act does not apply to machines designed for pari mutuel betting at a racetrack  such as the company s pari mutuel wagering terminal

lottery operations at the present time  states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  all the canadian provinces  mexico and many other foreign countries authorize lotteries 
once authorized  the award of lottery contracts and ongoing operation of lotteries in the united states is highly regulated 
although certain of the features of a lottery  such as the percentage of gross revenues which must be paid back to players in prize money  are usually established by legislation  the lottery authorities generally exercise significant authority  including the determination of the types of games played  the price of each wager  the manner in which the lottery is marketed and the selection of the vendors of equipment and services 
to ensure the integrity of the contract award and wagering process  most jurisdictions require detailed background disclosure on a continuous basis from  and conduct background investigations of  the vendor  its subsidiaries and affiliates and its principal shareholders 
background investigations of the vendor s employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of the system are also generally conducted  and most states reserve the right to require the removal of employees whom they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery 
certain jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage typically five percent or more of the company s securities 
the failure of such beneficial owners to submit to such background checks and provide such disclosure could result in the imposition of penalties upon such beneficial owners and could jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to the company or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract 
the international jurisdictions in which the company markets its lottery systems also usually have legislation and regulations governing lottery operations 
the regulation of lotteries in these international jurisdictions typically varies from the regulation of lotteries in the united states 
in addition  restrictions are often imposed on foreign corporations seeking to do business in such jurisdictions 
united states and international regulations affecting lotteries are subject to change 
the company cannot predict with certainty the impact on its business of changes in regulations

at the expiration of the public notice period  assuming no objections are received from the public  the fcc usually will grant the application within two to three weeks if it determines that the granting of such applications is in the public interest 
at present  states  puerto rico  all of the canadian provinces  mexico and many other foreign countries authorize inter state and or intra state pari mutuel wagering  which may involve the simulcasting of such races 
licensing and other regulatory requirements associated with such simulcasting activities are similar to those governing pari mutuel wagering  and are generally enforced by pari mutuel regulators 
in addition  contracts with host tracks whose races are simulcast by the company or its subsidiaries to other facilities within or outside the jurisdictions in which such races are held may be subject to approval by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions from and or to which the races are simulcast 
the company believes that it and or its subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and that the company  its subsidiaries  and or the appropriate third parties have entered into contracts and obtained the necessary regulatory approvals to lawfully conduct current simulcast operations

     weighted average shares out standing      item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background the company operates in two business segments  pari mutuel operations and lottery operations 
pari mutuel operations include the north american and international on track and otb pari mutuel operations  simulcasting services  connecticut otb operations  video gaming and cbs the company s sports wagering service business which was sold in october lottery operations include both domestic and international lottery operations including tele control  the company s european lottery business which was sold in april  as well as systems and equipment sales 
the company is the leading provider of computerized pari mutuel wagering systems to the north american racing industry and is also a leading provider of such systems worldwide 
the company also owns and operates the connecticut otb and is the leading provider of racing industry simulcasting services in the united states 
additionally  the company provides technologically advanced vgms to the north american racing industry for use at racetracks 
the company also provides lottery systems and equipment in the united states and internationally 
historically  the company s revenues have been derived from two principal sources service revenues pursuant to multi year contracts to provide wagering systems and other services  which are typically based on a percentage of handle and or daily or monthly fees  and sales contracts for wagering equipment and software 
the first quarter of the fiscal year and a portion of the second fiscal quarter traditionally comprise the weakest season for wagering service revenue 
wagering equipment sales revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions which do not recur on an annual basis  but which historically have given rise to additional terminal and systems software sales to existing customers 
consequently  revenues and operating results could vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales 
the company s business strategy over the past several years has been to refocus its activities on its core businesses  which generate recurring revenues rather than one time equipment sales  and to reduce its operating expenses 
consistent with this strategy  the company i in october  sold its casino sports wagering business for approximately million and ii in april  sold its european lottery business for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sales of these businesses were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the sales of the casino sports wagering business and the european lottery business described above  as well as the acquisitions of simulcasting operations and the french pari mutuel business in fiscal  which were accounted for as purchases  affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended october  in thousands pari mutuel operations operating revenues service revenue    sales revenue    total revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortiza tion    lottery operations operating revenues service revenue    sales revenue    total revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortiza tion    company total operating revenues service revenue    sales revenue    total revenue    gross profit excluding depreciation and amortiza tion    fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis revenues decreased or million to million in the fiscal year ended october  from million in fiscal pari mutuel operations service revenues of million for the fiscal year improved million or from million in the prior year 
this improvement reflects revenue increases of million as a result of growth in handle in the company s north american pari mutuel and connecticut otb operations  and the addition of new customers in the simulcasting business 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of million in revenue provided in the prior year period by the casino sports wagering business which was sold in october and a loss of million in sales of excess transponder time due to the unanticipated shutdown of one of the satellites leased by the company 
the growth in handle during fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to the addition of six new north american racetrack and otb sites  full card simulcasting at three north american racetrack customers  the increase in the number of vgm machines  and the expansion of otb operations in connecticut to seven days a week in the first quarter of fiscal sales revenue in fiscal of million increased million from million in the prior year  due in part to a million export sale of a totalisator system to the jockey club of peru 
lottery operations service revenues decreased million during fiscal from million to million primarily because of the sale of the european lottery business in april sales revenues decreased significantly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the delivery of systems by the european lottery business to several german lottery contract sites coupled with deliveries by the company of terminals and parts to italy s totip pari mutuel lottery pool in fiscal  partially offset by the delivery of approximately terminals to the israel lottery in fiscal gross profit analysis total gross profits earned by the company  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel operations of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due to increased north american pari mutuel revenues and improved simulcasting margins resulting from lower equipment costs 
these increases were partially offset by million lower margins from the loss of sales of excess transponder time  the absence of margin provided in the prior year by the casino sports wagering business which was sold in october  and lower profit on the company s european pari mutuel operations as the result of the strengthening of the us dollar early in the year 
gross profits earned by the lottery operations totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of million compared to the fiscal level of million 
this decline is attributable to the non recurring delivery of computer systems to the german lottery in fiscal  coupled with lower european lottery service revenues due to the sale of the business unit in april and a decrease in the number of terminals delivered to italy s totip pari mutuel lottery 
partly offsetting these declines were margins earned on equipment delivered to the company s customer in israel 
total gross profits on equipment sales were for the year  as compared to gross profits on such sales of in fiscal as a result of a change in product mix 
gross profits on services were approximately for fiscal  a improvement over margins earned in fiscal  reflecting higher revenues and improved operating efficiencies in the north american pari mutuel  otb and simulcasting operations 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting the absence of expenses for businesses sold in fiscal years and excluding businesses sold  selling general and administrative expenses increased or million  reflecting higher compensation costs  partially offset by lower litigation expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from the absence of expenses related to the businesses sold in fiscal and excluding businesses sold  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or as a result of the non recurring effect of depreciation on certain assets in fiscal  partially offset by higher depreciation on fiscal and fiscal capital additions for north america s pari mutuel and video gaming operations 
interest expense was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease reflects lower borrowing levels as a result of asset sales  partially offset by higher interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense was million in fisca compared to million in fiscal income tax expense principally reflects foreign tax expense  since no us federal tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
the decrease in income tax expense principally reflects the sale of the european lottery business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis revenues increased or million to million in the fiscal year ended october  from million in fiscal pari mutuel operations service revenues of million for the fiscal year ended october  improved million or compared to the prior year principally because of the growth in handle at connecticut otb attributable to operation of the sports haven r simulcast multi entertainment facility for the full fiscal year  coupled with higher revenues from the sale of excess transponder time due to increased signal capacity  as well as increased handle at certain north american racetracks 
sales revenue declined million to million for the fiscal year ended october  reflecting the decrease in international equipment sales during the year 
lottery operations service revenues were down slightly for the fiscal year ended october  because of the change in the revenue mix of the company s european lottery operation from primarily service to sales during coupled with reduced wagering on the connecticut state lottery 
equipment sales improved significantly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this improvement is attributable to the delivery of computer equipment by the company s european lottery operations to six german lottery contract sites  as well as the delivery of terminals and parts to italy s totip pari mutuel lottery 
gross profit analysis total gross profits earned by the company  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel operations of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal  principally due to the growth in handle at connecticut otb 
other gross profit increases resulting from increased north american pari mutuel and off track betting revenues and higher simulcasting revenues were largely offset by higher expenses in the company s european pari mutuel operations 
gross profits earned by the lottery operations totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal reflecting the delivery of equipment by the company s european lottery operations and an increase in the number of terminals delivered to italy s totip pari mutuel lottery 
gross profits on equipment sales were for the year  a significant improvement over fiscal gross margins on services were approximately for  down from margins earned in fiscal reflecting the change in revenue mix in the company s european lottery operations 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in the fiscal year ended october  from million in fiscal expense reductions resulting from fiscal restructuring activities and other cost reduction programs were partially offset by increased expenses for legal compliance  litigation and compensation costs  and contractual costs incurred upon the departure of the former president of the company 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended october  compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to capital additions for north america s pari mutuel video gaming operations  new terminals and software installed at the connecticut state lottery  investment in european lottery software  the january acquisition by the company of simulcasting assets  and the increased investment in the sports haven r facility 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in the fiscal year ended october  reflecting a million increase due to additional borrowings  and a million increase in amortization of deferred financing costs 
these increases were offset by a million decrease due to lower interest rates  and a decrease of million due to bank waiver and amendment fees incurred in fiscal income taxes income tax expense was million in the period compared to an expense of million in the period 
income tax expense principally reflects foreign tax expense  since no tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
unusual charges unusual charges were recorded in the amount of million in fiscal  partially offset by the reversal of million of restructuring cost accruals because of the company s plan to continue limited manufacturing of wagering terminals at its ireland manufacturing facility 
these charges consist of i million for costs incurred in connection with the company s proposed but uncompleted third quarter debt offering  and ii million in selling  general and administrative expenses for contractual payments related to the departure of the former president of the company 
in fiscal  the company recorded million of unusual charges resulting substantially from the companys restructuring and from certain asset valuation adjustments  which costs have been allocated to the pari mutuel operations million and lottery operations million 
the restructuring charges totaled million and were attributable to the closing of the owings mills lottery support facility and the scaling back of certain international activities  including the planned closing of the company s manufacturing facility in ballymahon  ireland 
the decision to close the aforementioned facilities resulted in the elimination of approximately full time positions 
the restructuring charge of million included million in employee termination benefits  million attributable to the cancellation of certain leasehold contracts  million in connection with the write down of inventory and equipment previously used in the lottery terminal manufacturing process including the repayment of certain foreign capital equipment economic development grants  million in capitalized software systems development costs written off in connection with the company s decision to terminate support for certain of its domestic lottery products and million in other miscellaneous asset valuation adjustments and expenses 
the company estimated that the restructuring plans will result in annual savings of approximately million 
the company wrote off million relating to certain investments and other non current assets principally associated with its pari mutuel operations which included million attributable to the company s mexican vgm contracts 
the decision to write off the company s investment in mexican vgm contracts was based on the continued economic and political turmoil in mexico which repeatedly interfered with the company s ability to complete implementation of the contracts 
also included in the write off of investments and other non current assets was million primarily attributable to lottery terminals  and million attributable to other assets 
technical limitations led to the company s re evaluation of the continued viability of the lottery terminals 
the remaining million of unusual charges included miscellaneous asset valuation adjustments  principally consisting of receivable write offs of million and severance costs of million 
in addition  the company recorded million of unusual charges for bank credit agreement costs primarily relating to a waiver of certain financial covenants under the company s existing credit agreement 
as a result of these charges  the company anticipated total cash obligations of approximately million  of which million was paid through october  and million was reversed in fiscal because of the company s decision to continue limited manufacturing in ireland 
the restructurings were completed in fiscal and the company has satisfied all cash obligations with respect to the restructuring charges 
liquidity and capital resources on july   the company issued million of senior notes due august  see note to consolidated financial statements  which were exchanged for million of series b notes due the notes in connection with the company s exchange offer in october the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually on each february and august the notes are senior  unsecured obligations of the company  ranking senior in right and priority of payment to all indebtedness of the company that by its terms is expressly subordinated to the notes

the notes will be redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the company  at any time on or after august   at redemption prices of in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year and thereafter  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
in addition  at any time prior to august   the company may  at its option  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity offerings  as defined  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  if any  provided  however  that at least of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding immediately after any such redemption 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  as defined  to incur additional indebtedness  create certain liens  pay dividends  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the company 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting fees and expenses of approximately million  were approximately million  of which approximately million was used to repay million of indebtedness and million of accrued interest under the company s previously existing senior bank credit facility the senior facility 
in addition  approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repurchase  at a discount  subordinated debentures totaling million plus accrued interest and fees see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company also entered into a new revolving credit facility the facility with certain lenders which matures in february the facility provides for borrowings of up to million  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the facility requires mandatory commitment reductions upon the occurrence of certain events  including asset sales and the incurrence of certain indebtedness  in each case  in excess of specified thresholds 
in addition  the company may make optional prepayments and commitment reductions 
borrowings under the facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and will bear interest at the base rate as defined plus a margin ranging from to per annum  or the eurodollar rate as defined plus a margin ranging from to per annum  in each case depending on the company s performance as measured by the ratio of debt as defined to ebitda as defined 
fees will be payable on outstanding letters of credit equal to the applicable eurodollar rate margin as of october   plus a facing fee of per annum 
a commitment fee of per annum is payable on the unused amount of the facility 
obligations under the facility are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of the company s us subsidiaries 
in addition  the facility is secured by i first priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the company and its us subsidiaries  and ii a first priority lien on all of the capital stock of the company s us subsidiaries and on of the capital stock of the company s us subsidiaries 
the facility contains certain covenants which limit the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make restricted payments  including dividends  engage in mergers  consolidations and asset sales  make acquisitions  investments and capital expenditures  and engage in certain transactions with certain subsidiaries and affiliates  in each case beyond certain thresholds 
the facility also requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including maintenance of minimum ebitda and interest coverage levels  and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio 
although there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at october   approximately million of letters of credit  including million issued in connection with the sale of the european lottery business are guaranteed under the new facility 
as of october   the company had approximately million available for borrowing under the facility 
at october   the company s available cash and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at october  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended october  utilizing million of cash provided by operating activities  the company invested principally in contract expenditures and software systems development 
the balance of the cash provided by operating activities of million  together with approximately million of cash proceeds from the sale of the european lottery business and the cash balance on hand at the business unit at the closing of the sale  plus million of proceeds from the sale of common stock  were used to reduce borrowings by million under the company s senior facility prior to the refinancing and by million on other long term loans 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had million of cash borrowing availability under the facility at october  the company believes that  although it expects to incur a net loss in fiscal  its cash resources  anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under the facility should provide sufficient liquidity to meet scheduled interest payments and anticipated capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
the company believes that additional financing will be required thereafter for capital expenditures and to enable it to meet its debt service obligations  including principal payments under the notes  the facility and the subordinated debentures 
the company has been awarded a contract to service the connecticut lottery and expects to finance its obligations under the contract to provide approximately  lottery terminals by entering into a long term financing arrangement in fiscal there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure such financing with terms favorable to the company 
in the event the company is unable to secure such financing  it will need to use either some of the company s existing cash or cash available under the facility 
extraordinary items in connection with the issuance of the notes in the third quarter of fiscal  and the subsequent repayment of all amounts outstanding under the senior facility see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company wrote off million of deferred financing fees associated with the senior facility 
the company also used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repurchase million of its subordinated debentures for million  resulting in a million gain on the early retirement of this debt 
there were no tax benefits recognized on the net extraordinary loss because the company is currently in a tax loss carryforward position 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas 
this statement simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share eps and makes them comparable to international eps standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps and requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement of all entities with complex capital structures 
sfas also requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
the company intends to implement sfas  as required  in fiscal since the company has experienced net losses in fiscal years  and  stock options and stock warrants are anti dilutive 
therefore  they have been and would continue to be excluded from the denominator of the earnings per common share calculation as reported in the accompanying financial statements and as contemplated under sfas earnings per common share in fiscal years  and as computed under sfas are thus equal to earnings per share as presented in the accompanying financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non owner changes in equity 
sfas requires that companies disclose segment data based on how management makes decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
sfas and are effective for fiscal adoption of these standards is expected to result in additional disclosures  but will not have an effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  software revenue recognition the sop 
the sop established criteria for recognizing revenue in certain software sales arrangements 
the sop is effective for fiscal year and will be adopted by the company on a prospective basis 
the company does not expect the sop to have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
year the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of modifying computer software systems to accommodate year transactions 
these modifications may result in additional programming expenses  but as the majority of the company s wagering systems are designed to process transactions that are settled on a daily basis  it is expected that these added expenses will not significantly affect the company s financial position or operating results
