item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of the company s total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers and from wholesale off system transactions 
the remainders of such revenues were derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total system kwh sales for the company s on system customers increased only slightly during due to cool summer weather  while revenues increased more than the corresponding increase in kwhs primarily due to increased rates in missouri as reflected in the table below 
customer growth slowed from in to in residential kwh sales decreased slightly by due to a milder first half of  in which kwh sales were down  as compared to the residential revenues increased due to a increase in kwh sales during the last half of as compared to the same period in  and because of increased rates in missouri during the last half of commercial and industrial classes showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues because their sales are not impacted by weather as much as residential customers 
on system wholesale kwh sales were up slightly in  reflecting customer growth in the wholesale territories 
revenues associated with these ferc regulated kwh sales increased at a lower rate due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
kwh sales to and revenues from the company s on system customers increased during due to warm summer temperatures during the second quarter  particularly during the month of june  and colder than normal weather during the first and fourth quarters compared to the same periods in mild weather conditions during the third quarter of partially offset the positive impact of such favorable weather conditions 
customer growth positively impacted kwh sales and related revenue 
in addition  the effect of an electric rate increase in missouri effective november contributed to the increased revenue during the year 
residential and commercial kwh sales increased more than the corresponding increase in revenues during  primarily due to the effect of changes in the company s rate design in which shifted revenue from winter billing periods to summer billing periods 
on system wholesale kwh sales and revenues were up during the period reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
wholesale on system revenues in increased at a greater relative amount than kwh sales due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such sales 
the following table sets forth information regarding electric rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above percent date increase increase increase date jurisdiction requested requested granted granted effective missouri   missouri   an increase of  was granted effective an additional  increase became effective on august   the company filed a request with the missouri public service commission the missouri commission for a general annual increase in rates for its missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
a stipulated agreement was filed by the parties for approximately  and on july   the missouri commission issued an order approving an annual increase in rates of  or  effective july  the amount did not include the company s investment in unit no 
at the company s state line plant because the commission deemed that unit no 
did not meet all the specified in service criteria 
on july   the company filed an application for rehearing regarding the status of unit no 
 seeking to recover the remaining  of the stipulated agreement 
on september   the missouri commission issued an order approving an additional annual increase in rates in the amount of  or  effective september   making the total increase in annual revenue from this proceeding  or 
the company filed an application on february   to increase rates in the state of arkansas by  any increase relating to this filing will be granted in late and is not expected to have a material effect on operating results for the company s future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  regulation  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers 
inflation affects the company s operations in that historical costs  rather than current replacement costs  are recovered in the company s rates 
off system transactions in addition to sales to its own customers  the company sells power  as available  to other utilities and provides transmission service through its system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during both and  income from such off system transactions exceeded related expenses by approximately million annually 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during  due primarily to the increased generation from gas fired combustion turbine units at both state line and the energy center 
this increased generation was due to increased customer demand in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as decreased energy availability in the southwest power pool during the month of october 
natural gas prices were also higher by during as compared to the company does not have fuel adjustment clauses under which such increased costs can be recovered in missouri and kansas 
total purchased power costs decreased slightly during  due primarily to increased usage of the company s own generation facilities 
unit no 
at the state line power plant was placed in service on june   and added megawatts of capability 
although the asbury plant underwent an extended five week spring outage in  the plant was back on line ahead of schedule and went on to record a new continuous run record of days and a record availability rate of 
the asbury plant was taken out of service in late january to repair a generator winding problem 
the company took this opportunity while the plant was down to shift the planned spring maintenance outage which was scheduled for the second quarter to this time period 
the asbury plant returned to service in early march 
as a result  purchased power costs should increase in the first quarter but should be offset by lower costs in the second quarter 
other operating expenses increased approximately million during  compared to  due primarily to an increase in production expenses related to the extended asbury plant outage in the spring of maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during because of the high level of distribution system maintenance in caused by storm damage discussed below 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during primarily because unit no 
at the state line plant was placed into service in june total income taxes increased during due primarily to higher taxable income 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
excluding the one time pre tax charge of approximately million in the third quarter of relating to the company s voluntary early retirement program the verp  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to levels 
purchased power costs were up during  compared to the prior year  primarily because of an million increase in purchased power costs resulting from increased purchases of replacement energy during an extended five year turbine inspection at the asbury plant 
in addition  the company increased its level of purchases to meet higher customer demand during the first half and fourth quarter of  particularly during periods of extremely cold weather during january and february of  when the company s suppliers curtailed the delivery of natural gas to the company and other utilities in the region 
the weather also resulted in the decreased availability of low cost energy from hydro and nuclear units of other utilities 
these factors contributed to higher demand and a tight market for purchased energy and resulted in significantly higher prices for such energy during the first half of when compared to the same periods in fuel costs increased million in  primarily because of the use of higher cost fuel oil at the energy center and riverton plant during periods of extremely cold weather early in the year when natural gas supplies were curtailed 
other operating expenses decreased approximately million during excluding expenses related to the verp  due primarily to lower general and administrative costs 
during  the company s general and administrative costs were higher in large part because of costs associated with litigation and the company s competitive positioning process cpp 
maintenance and repair expense increased during due primarily to increased maintenance performed on the company s distribution system as a result of windstorm damage in april and ice storm damage in november depreciation and amortization expense increased due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service during  particularly at the company s state line power plant 
total income taxes increased during due primarily to higher taxable income 
other taxes increased due to higher levels of plant in service 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during  and during afudc decreased significantly during as well as during  reflecting the construction of state line unit no 
 which was placed in service in june  and of state line unit no 
 which was placed in service in may see note of notes to financial statements under item for more discussion of afudc 
interest income decreased during and  reflecting lower balances of cash available for investment particularly due to increased levels of construction 
interest charges for were significantly higher because of the issuance of million of the company s first mortgage bonds in december the proceeds from that sale were used  in part  for expenses incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
commercial paper interest increased during the year due to increased usage of short term debt to finance the company s construction program 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenue resulted mainly from an increase in missouri rates 
the missouri jurisdiction accounts for approximately of the on system retail sales of the company 
a cool summer and fairly mild winter as well as increases in fuel costs and decreased levels of afudc partially offset the impact of the rate increase 
the missouri rate increase will favorably impact the company s operating results in earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in a one time charge relating to the verp reduced earnings by per share 
increased revenue resulting from weather conditions conducive to increased kwh sales  continued customer growth and the rate increase received in missouri  effective november  were partially offset by increased purchased power expenses  fuel costs  and distribution maintenance expenses  as well as decreased levels of afudc 
earnings per share in also reflect a greater number of shares outstanding because of the company s issuance of  shares of common stock in april competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  none of the states in which the company operates has taken any such action 
however  in missouri  the public service commission adopted an order establishing a docket and creating a task force on retail electric competition 
the task force  on which the company is represented  is charged with preparing comprehensive reports for the commission that include recommendations on how missouri should implement retail electric competition in the event that legislation is enacted to authorize it 
in kansas  several bills dealing with restructuring were introduced into the house and senate  however  no legislative action was taken during in oklahoma  the electric restructuring act of was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor 
the bill  with a target date of july   was designed to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state and move the state toward open competition for electric generation 
in arkansas  the house and senate passed a concurrent resolution requesting a study of the impact of competition on the electric utility industry 
the arkansas public service commission has opened four dockets to receive comments and testimony on restructuring 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding effects of deregulation 
in april  the ferc issued order no 
the order which requires all electric utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services that they provide themselves 
the utility would have to take service under those tariffs for its own wholesale power transactions 
the order requires a functional unbundling of transmission and power marketing services 
the order also provides stranded cost recovery mechanisms for utilities to recover costs that were incurred to serve wholesale customers that would no longer be recoverable as a result of the customer departing the system and obtaining electric service from another supplier 
in accordance with the order  on july   the company filed its open access transmission tariff with the ferc 
following an extensive audit and discussions  the company  the ferc and intervenors reached a settlement on august   and the rates submitted with the settlement  applicable to customers who did not have service agreements in effect  were made effective as of july  for customers with service agreements in effect  the tariff will not be applicable until a rate increase has been filed which may not be made prior to june the company cannot currently predict the effect of the tariff on its future operations 
in conjunction with order no 
 the ferc issued a companion order  order no 
 which defines the type and timing of information to be made available by utilities to wholesale customers and establishes standards of conduct to ensure that a utility s transmission system operates independently of the utility s segment which engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity 
in december  the company filed with the ferc a request for waiver of these standards of conduct 
on may   the ferc issued an order granting the company s request for a waiver 
several factors exist which may enhance the company s ability to compete as deregulation occurs 
the company is able to generate and purchase power relatively inexpensively  during  the company s retail rates were approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  less than of the company s electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling 
at the same time  the company could face increased competitive pressure as a result of its reliance on relatively large amounts of purchased power and its extensive interconnections with neighboring utilities 
in recognition of its need to provide peaking power  during june the company placed in service state line ii  a mw gas turbine 
in addition  in response to deregulation and restructuring which has led to uncertainty as to returns on large capital investments  the company has reduced planned construction expenditures and entered into an agreement with western resources for future purchased power 
in anticipation of changes in the competitive environment  the company in undertook its cpp to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in providing service to its customers 
as part of the cpp  the company redesigned its organizational structure 
one result of this redesigned organizational structure was the establishment of the commercial operations department  which combined the customer service  engineering and transmission distribution functions so that the needs of the customer can be met by one contact person instead of three 
the company also implemented the company s call center in june  and began hour  seven days a week operation in june to further address customer needs 
in  the company invested in non regulated business for the first time 
since then  the company has offered electronic monitored security and has leased capacity on its broadband fiber optics network from springfield to branson  missouri 
liquidity and capital resources the company s construction related expenditures totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
approximately million of construction expenditures during were related to the construction of unit no 
at the state line power plant  which was placed in service on june  additions to the company s transmission and distribution systems to accommodate customer growth represented approximately million of construction expenditures during approximately million of the construction expenditures are related to the company s investment in fiber optics cable and equipment which the company plans to utilize and to lease to other entities 
approximately of construction expenditures and other capital requirements for were satisfied internally from operations 
estimated construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  the company anticipates that it will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to the company s distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
internally generated funds are expected to provide at least of the funds required between and for estimated construction expenditures 
as in the past  the company intends to utilize short term debt to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction and repay such borrowings with the proceeds of sales of public offerings of long term debt or equity securities  including the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan  and from internally generated funds 
the company will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
see note of notes to financial statements under item regarding the company s line of credit 
on april   the company sold to the public in an underwritten offering  shares of its common stock for approximately million 
on december   the company sold to the public in an underwritten offering million aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds  series due the net proceeds from these sales were added to the company s general funds  which were used to repay short term indebtedness and for expenses incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
the company currently has effective with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement under which it may sell up to million aggregate value of its common stock  cumulative preferred stock  and or first mortgage bonds 
as of december   the company s ratings for its first mortgage bonds  preferred stock and commercial paper were as follows phoenix duff moody s standard phelps poor s first mortgage bonds a a a preferred stock a a bbb commercial paper d p a year information systems modifications empire is engaged in an on going project to identify  evaluate and implement changes to computer systems and applications in order to achieve a year date conversion with no adverse effect on customers or disruption to business operations 
the company has purchased a new financial management software package from peoplesoft that is year compliant 
the package includes systems for general ledger  accounts payable  accounts receivable  and property accounting  purchasing and inventory  human resources and payroll  and budgeting and project tracking 
in addition  a new customer information system is being developed internally which will be year compliant 
installation of these systems which are anticipated to substantially mitigate the company s year exposure will be completed during work is ongoing in other areas of the company as well as at third parties with whom it does business to resolve year problems 
the cost of this project is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position
