an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure to rising interest rates is mitigated by the existing debt level of approximately of the company s current market capitalization including the company s share of co investment partnerships debt  by utilizing intermediate term fixed rate debt of total debt  and by using interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for five years on  of total debt of the company s floating rate debt
