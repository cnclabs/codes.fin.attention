the purpose of this section is to give interpretive guidance to the reader of the financial statements 
for specific accounting policies and financial statement detail  refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
overview systems computer technology corporation the company develops  licenses  and supports a suite of client server  enterprise software and provides a range of information technology outsourcing services 
in addition  the company offers a series of related software services including systems implementation  systems integration  and maintenance and enhancements 
the company s markets are higher education  manufacturing distribution  utilities  and government 
the company s focus on these four vertical markets enables it to develop and utilize a base of industry expertise to deliver products and services that address specific client requirements 
the company derives software services revenues from a variety of professional support services  which include systems implementation  modification  training  and support  consulting services  and information systems planning and integration 
maintenance and enhancements contracts allow customers access to telephone support services  regulatory updates  and functional and technical enhancements 
the company provides systems integration services for software implementations that include training  data conversion  integration  and customizations for client systems 
these contracts are typically longer in term than software support services and shorter in term than information technology outsourcing services 
the company provides outsourcing services  which are comprised of a range of information technology areas including end user computing solutions  network management  applications outsourcing  and business process outsourcing 
these services are designed to assume total or partial control of and responsibility for clients information resources  generally on a long term basis 
the company provides management  staffing  and support with skilled information systems personnel  and industry specialists who are knowledgeable in both computer based technologies and the functional aspects of clients activities 
results of operations the following table sets forth a income statement items as a percentage of total revenues and b the percentage change for each item from the prior year comparative period 
of total revenues change from year ended september  prior year revenues outsourcing services software sales maintenance and enhancements software services other  primarily interest total expenses cost of services  sales  and maintenance and enhancements selling  general  and administrative charge for purchased research and development interest expense income before income taxes the following table sets forth the gross profit for each of the following revenue categories as a percentage of revenue for each such category and the total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue 
the company does not separately present the cost of maintenance and enhancements revenue as it is impracticable to separate such cost from the cost of software sales 
gross profit outsourcing services software sales and maintenance and enhancements software services total revenues growth in outsourcing services revenue largely results from significant contract signings 
the increase in outsourcing services revenue in the year ended september  is primarily the result of increases in outsourcing services provided to significant clients and fiscal year contract signings 
the increase in outsourcing services revenue in the year ended september  was primarily the result of increases in outsourcing services provided to two clients and new contract signings during fiscal year contract renewal rates  as a percentage of annual revenue from contracts available for renewal  for the fiscal years   and were   and  respectively 
contracts available for renewal in a particular period include contracts with expiration dates within the period  as well as contracts renewed during the period which have expiration dates in a later period 
software sales increased in the year ended september  compared to the prior year period due primarily to increased licenses of banner customer information system cis software to the utility market and increased banner software licenses to the higher education market 
the company experienced a slight increase in license fee revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year in its adage enterprise resource planning erp software 
software sales increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year due primarily to increased licenses of adage erp software to the manufacturing market  increased banner software licenses to the higher education market  and increased licenses of banner customer information system cis software to the utility market 
the and increases in maintenance and enhancements revenue in fiscal years and  respectively  were the result of the growing installed base of clients in the higher education  manufacturing distribution  and utility marketplaces 
additionally  the company continues to experience a high annual renewal rate on existing maintenance contracts in these marketplaces 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues in the government market as the result of the sale of a product line on which the company was no longer selling licenses but was providing maintenance services through fiscal year software services revenue increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as the result of increases in implementation and integration services in the manufacturing  utility  and higher education markets 
these increases were offset by decreases  compared to the prior year period  in services provided to the international utility market 
software services revenue increased in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  primarily as the result of increases in adage erp implementations and support services to the manufacturing market and implementations and integration services in the utility and the higher education markets 
the increase in other revenue for the year ended september  is attributable to increased interest revenue from the increased cash and short term investments balance resulting from the debt issuance in october and to a one time thousand gain on the sale of an inactive product line in the first quarter of fiscal year gross profit gross profit decreased as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue from to for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the total gross profit percentage decreased primarily because of a decrease in the software sales and maintenance and enhancements gross profit  which makes up the greatest percentage of the company s total gross profit 
this decrease was primarily the result of an increase in non capitalized product development expenditures  principally in the manufacturing business  at a greater rate than the revenue increase 
the outsourcing services gross profit increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year as a result of higher margins on new contract signings compared with older contracts 
the software services margin increased primarily as a result of increased profitability in the utility and manufacturing businesses services although margins continued to be impacted by unprofitable international operations 
the company is continuing to focus on installation and systems integration services in each of its markets 
since service margins have historically been lower than the margins derived from software sales and maintenance and enhancements  an increase in services revenue as a percentage of total revenue historically has resulted in a lower overall profit margin 
gross profit increased as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue from to for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase in the software sales and maintenance and enhancements gross profit was primarily the result of significant growth in license fee revenue 
the software services margin increased primarily as a result of increases in the utility and manufacturing businesses gross margin 
additionally  in fiscal year  the software services costs reflected increased expenditures in the utility business  including a second quarter contract loss provision of million to reflect the cost of satisfying certain obligations relating to the banner cis product 
these obligations were satisfied during fiscal year the increases in software services gross profit for the year were offset by decreases in the international utility gross profit  where additional costs were incurred in the third and fourth quarters as a result of contract delays and cost overruns 
fygir acquisition in september  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of fygir logistic information systems  bv fygir 
fygir is a leading provider of supply chain planning software 
the total cost of the acquisition was million  of which million is held in escrow 
provided the company does not have any claim to the amount escrowed  the company will release any amounts remaining in the escrow to the seller on september  in conjunction with the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase  the company incurred a charge of million for in process research and development 
included in this amount were the fair values of fygir products under development that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
the in process technology acquired in the fygir acquisition consisted of multiple significant research and development projects  most of which the company intends to continue to develop 
the company believes that these projects  which can be separated into three separate categories significant new features  new technology  and tightly integrated will all contribute to future generations of the company s software 
at the time of the fygir acquisition  the company assigned a value of million to the fygir in process technology with the assistance of an independent valuation 
the valuation considered the securities and exchange commission s views on in process research and development as set forth in its september  letter to the american institute of certified public accountants 
significant new features projects represent significant improvements to existing core technology acquired that could result in price and sales increases 
new technology projects are associated with the design of next generation fygir products 
tightly integrated projects are related to integrating fygir developed technology with the company s technology 
the company estimates that the significant new features  new technology  and tightly integrated projects were in the aggregate approximately   and complete  respectively  as of the date of acquisition 
at the time of the fygir valuation  the anticipated remaining development project expenses were approximately million 
these costs are estimated to be incurred in fiscal years through the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design requirements  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
the company currently expects that the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the supply chain management industry  changes in other product and service offerings  or other developments may cause the company to alter or abandon these plans 
income taxes the fiscal year provision for income taxes does not reflect the customary relationship between income and tax expense principally due to state income taxes and the research and development tax credit 
the research and development tax credit expired in june as a result  the fiscal year provision reflects the benefit of the credit for only the first nine months of the fiscal year 
the research and development tax credit was extended in october  but is scheduled to expire in june the provision for income taxes for the year ended september  reflects the benefit of the research and development tax credit  which was in effect for the entire fiscal year 
the provision for the year ended september  reflects the impact of valuation allowances provided with respect to tax loss carryforwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions and the relative impact of non deductible expenses 
at september   the company has million tax loss carryforwards in various states and million of net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the state loss carryforwards expire in various periods ending september  the foreign tax losses have indefinite carryforwards 
at september   the company has recorded tax credits and loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowance  of million related primarily to the expected benefit of foreign tax loss carryforwards 
the company s foreign subsidiaries must generate approximately million in pre tax earnings in order to realize the related net deferred tax asset 
the company recently restructured its international business to emphasize sales and distribution of its products in addition to product development 
management believes that it is more likely than not that this international restructuring will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the company s net deferred tax assets 
the company s application for a change in accounting method previously filed with the internal revenue service was accepted 
this method change will result in a reclassification from current income taxes payable to deferred income taxes of approximately million over the next two years 
foreign operations the local currency is the functional currency of the company s foreign operations 
foreign operations represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue 
the company does not believe its foreign currency exposure is significant and analyzes the desirability of hedging the exposure on an ongoing basis 
cyclical nature of business certain non seasonal factors have resulted in quarterly fluctuations in operating results  including variability of software license fee revenues  seasonal patterns of capital spending by clients  the timing and receipt of orders  competition  pricing  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  levels of market acceptance for new products  impending year issues  and general economic and political conditions 
while the company has historically generated a greater portion of license fees in total revenue in the last two fiscal quarters  the non seasonal factors cited above may have a greater effect than seasonality on the company s results of operations 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position in october  the company issued million of convertible subordinated debentures bearing interest at and maturing on october  in november  pursuant to an underwriters option  the company issued an additional million of convertible debentures 
the debentures are convertible into common stock of the company at any time prior to redemption or maturity at a conversion price of per share  subject to change as defined in the trust indenture 
the debentures are redeemable at any time after october  at prices decreasing from of the principal amount to par on october  the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million at september  and  respectively 
the short term investments balance increased to million at september  as a result of the first quarter debenture offering 
despite an increase in income before depreciation and amortization  and purchased research and development  operating cash flows decreased by million to million as a result of the growth in the outsourcing services business 
typically  the start of an outsourcing services contract results in increased cash outflows related to deferred costs and sales commissions  and client equipment purchases 
the company provides outsourcing services and software related services  including systems implementation and integration services 
contract fees from outsourcing services are typically based on multi year contracts ranging from three to years in length  and provide a recurring revenue stream throughout the term of the contract 
software services contracts  including systems implementation and integration services  usually have shorter terms than outsourcing services contracts  and billings are sometimes milestone based 
during the beginning of a typical outsourcing services contract  services are performed and expenses are incurred by the company at a greater rate than in the later part of the contract 
billings usually remain constant during the term of the contract and  in some cases  when a contract term is extended  the billing period is also extended over the new life of the contract 
in certain systems integration services contracts  payments are milestone based 
in these particular systems integration contracts  services are performed by the company but cannot be billed until the milestone is attained 
revenue is usually recognized as work is performed 
the resulting excess of revenues over billings is reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet as unbilled accounts receivable 
these unbilled accounts receivable balances have decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately to from fiscal year to fiscal year as an outsourcing services contract proceeds  services are performed and expenses are incurred at a lesser rate  resulting in billings exceeding revenue recognized  which causes a decrease in the unbilled accounts receivable  as will the achievement of a milestone in a systems integration services contract 
the remaining unbilled accounts receivable balance is comprised of software sales for which product has been shipped and revenue has been recognized but amounts have not been billed due to the payment terms established 
these unbilled balances are generally billed within one year 
the company s working capital at september  was million and was million at september  cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year the company s primary use of cash for investing activities was the purchase of available for sale investments from the proceeds of the bond offering during the first quarter of fiscal year and the aforementioned cash acquisition of fygir 
additionally  property and equipment expenditures increased as the result of fit up and remodeling costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year for a new office building in the company s malvern campus and the july purchase of land and subsequent building construction costs for a new building adjacent to the company s existing building in columbia  sc 
the construction and fit up of the new columbia building are expected to continue until sometime in the third quarter of fiscal year in october  the company signed a ten year lease agreement for space near its malvern campus 
the company will begin to incur fit up and remodeling costs in the first quarter of fiscal year with rent payments anticipated to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year primarily as the result of the net proceeds of the bond offering of million 
additionally  cash was provided by the exercise of stock options by the company s employees 
on april   the company called for redemption its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due september  the redemption date was may  during fiscal year  million shares were issued related to the conversion of all but thousand of the remaining convertible subordinated debentures 
had these converted shares been outstanding for the full year ended september   net income per common share for the year ended september  would have decreased by 
to 
the company has a million senior revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility agreement expires in june with optional annual renewals 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at september  or as long as borrowings are outstanding  and as a condition precedent to new borrowings  the company must comply with certain covenants established in the agreement 
under the covenants  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions 
during fiscal year  the covenants allowed the company to pay non stock dividends  repurchase capital stock  make distributions of assets to shareholders as long as the aggregate amount does not exceed million in any fiscal year and pay stock dividends 
in october  the agreement covenants were amended to allow the company to repurchase capital stock not to exceed million and million shares before april  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  short term investments  and borrowing arrangements should satisfy its financing needs for the foreseeable future 
on april   the company s board of directors authorized a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on may  to stockholders of record on may  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying from capital in excess of par value to common stock the par value of the additional shares arising from the split 
in addition  all references in the financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition to number of shares and per share amounts have been restated 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas  was effective for periods ending after december  as a result the company changed the method used to compute earnings per share and restated all prior periods presented 
under the new requirements  net income per common share excludes the dilutive effect of both stock options and convertible debentures  and net income per share assuming dilution must include the dilutive effect of both stock options and convertible debentures even if the dilutive effect is immaterial 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of its common shares 
the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or negotiated transactions and the timing of purchases will be based on a variety of factors including stock price  cash requirements  and market and economic factors 
during october  the company purchased approximately million shares for million 
the company entered into an agreement dated as of december  in which it agreed to purchase up to million of the common stock of campus pipeline  inc the stock 
as of december   the company had purchased million of the stock and received a equity interest in campus pipeline  inc if the company exercises all its options  the company will hold approximately of the outstanding common stock of campus pipeline  inc financial risk management the company invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  including state and municipal securities  corporate debt securities  and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
at september   a majority of the company s investments were in fixed rate instruments 
historically  the company s investment income has not been material to the company s financial results  and the company does not expect that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on the results of operations 
see note b to the financial statements  included in item of this form k  for additional information with respect to the investment portfolio 
the company also has issued fixed rate debt  which is convertible to company stock at a pre determined conversion price 
convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest rate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest rate environment and the price of the underlying company stock 
for the year ended september   the company s convertible debt  on an if converted basis  was not dilutive and  as a result  had no impact on the company s net income per share assuming dilution 
in future periods  the debt may be converted  or the if converted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced 
see note f to the financial statements  included in item of this form k  for additional information with respect to the company s long term debt

new accounting standards statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued in december and is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  statement of position  deferral of certain provisions of sop sop  was issued in april and defers for one year ie  until fiscal years beginning after december  the application of certain provisions of sop sop introduces a new framework whereby revenue would be recognized for each element in a software licensing arrangement when certain criteria are met 
sop requires license fees to be allocated to the separate elements of multiple element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and provides guidance on postcontract customer support arrangements 
sop defers the application of the provisions of sop which define what is considered vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements in a multiple element arrangement 
the company currently does not believe this new accounting guidance will have a significant impact on its results of operations  but continues to evaluate implementation guidance on this subject as it is published 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  was issued 
under sfas  all items that meet the definition of comprehensive income will be reported in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  disclosure is not required in interim financial statements in the initial year of adoption 
accordingly  the company will make the required disclosures for the fiscal year ending september   although the company has not fully assessed the impact of sfas on its financial disclosures 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock the matters discussed herein and elsewhere that are forward looking statements  including statements concerning the company s or management s intentions  beliefs  expectations  or predictions for the future  are based on current management expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the following discussion highlights some  but not all of the risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
the company s revenues and operating results can vary substantially from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors 
software sales revenues in any quarter are dependent on the execution of license agreements and shipment of product 
the execution of license agreements is difficult to predict for a variety of reasons including the following a significant portion of the company s license agreements are typically signed in the last month of each quarter  the duration of the company s sales cycle is relatively long  the size of transactions can vary widely  client projects may be postponed or canceled due to changes in the client s management  budgetary constraints  or strategic priorities  and clients often exhibit a seasonal pattern of capital spending 
the company has historically generated a greater portion of license fees in total revenue in the last two fiscal quarters  although there is no assurance that this will continue 
also  as the year approaches  many potential clients are evaluating their existing systems and must decide whether to repair or replace those systems which have year issues 
while the company believes that such evaluations have favorably impacted demand for its software products and services in the last two fiscal years  such demand is likely to diminish as the year approaches since services to remediate year issues must be completed in a timely manner and lead times required to complete systems implementations preclude system replacement as a timely solution to the year issue as the millennium nears 
given the lack of precedent for an issue of this magnitude  the company s ability to accurately forecast the impact of the year issue on quarter to quarter revenue achievement is limited 
since a significant part of the company s business results from software licensing  the company s business is characterized by a high degree of operating leverage 
the company s expense levels are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations as to future revenues and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if software licensing revenues do not meet expectations  net income is likely to be disproportionately adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
it is therefore possible that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below expectations 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be adversely affected 
the success of the company s business is dependent upon certain key management  sales  and technical personnel 
in addition  the company believes that to succeed in the future it will be required to continue to attract  retain  and motivate additional talented and qualified management  sales  and technical personnel 
competition for hiring such personnel in the information technology industry is intense and demand for such employees has  to date  exceeded supply 
the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to continue to attract  assimilate  and retain other skilled management  sales  and technical personnel 
the loss of certain of its existing key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the application software industry is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements  product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to compete successfully and to continue to develop and market new products and enhancements cost effectively  which will necessitate continued investment in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing products will not be rendered obsolete or non competitive by new industry standards or changing technology  that the company will be able to develop and market new products successfully  or that the company s new product offerings will be accepted by its markets 
furthermore  programs as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by third party test sites  errors will not be found in new product offerings  with the possible result of unanticipated costs and delays in market acceptance of these products 
certain of the company s contracts are subject to fiscal funding clauses  which provide that in the event of budgetary constraints  the client is entitled to reduce the level of services to be provided by the company with a corresponding reduction in the fee to be paid by the client  or in certain circumstances  to terminate the services altogether 
while the company has not been impacted materially by early terminations or reductions in service from the use of fiscal funding provisions in the past  there can be no assurance that such provisions will not give rise to early terminations or reductions of service in the future 
if clients of the company representing a substantial portion of the company s revenues were to invoke the fiscal funding provisions of their outsourcing services contracts  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company provides software related services  including systems implementation and integration services 
services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
in some circumstances  services are provided under fixed price arrangements in which revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revisions in estimates of costs to complete are reflected in operations in the period in which facts requiring those revisions become known 
other factors that could affect the company s future operating results include the effect of publicity on demand for the company s products and services  general economic and political conditions  continued market acceptance of the company s products and services  the timing of services contracts and renewals  continued competitive and pricing pressures in the marketplace  new product introductions by the company s competitors  and the company s ability to complete fixed price contracts profitably 
year in the past  many information technology systems were designed with two digit year codes that did not recognize century fields 
as a result  these hardware and software systems may not function or may give incorrect results during the periods surrounding the year the year issue is faced by every company which relies on computer systems 
in order to address this issue  such hardware and software systems must be upgraded or replaced in order to correctly process dates beginning in the year the company has a company wide year team to identify and resolve year issues associated with the company s internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  material third party relationships  and the products and services sold by the company 
the company s year readiness program includes corporate awareness  adoption of year standards  inventory  assessment  remediation  validation testing  and contingency planning 
the company has identified its main internal it systems and expects to complete remediation and testing of needed year related modifications by early the company is assessing its internal non it systems and expects to complete needed modifications to these systems by early also  because of the interdependence of it systems  the company is evaluating material third party relationships for year issues and expects to complete this effort by early the company has designed the most current versions of its products to be year ready 
the company is communicating with its customers the status of the company s products relating to year for products that were identified as needing updates to address year issues  the company has completed the updates to most of these products  and has made the updates available to the customers in the company will complete the few remaining minor product updates prior to march some of the company s customers are using product versions that the company will not support for year issues  the company is encouraging these customers to migrate to current product versions that are year ready 
also  in certain client outsourcing and services contracts  the company is evaluating year issues for its clients computing environments and implementing year related remediations 
some of this client remediation effort has been completed in with the remainder of the client remediation effort planned throughout the company has funded its year program from operating cash flows and has not separately accounted for these costs in the past 
the company will incur additional amounts related to the year program for administrative personnel to manage the project and for technical support for its products  services  and internal it systems 
the company believes that the vast majority of these costs are not incremental to the company but represent a reallocation of existing resources and does not believe that these costs have been or are expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the company believes that necessary modifications to its products will be made on a timely basis 
however  there can be no guarantee that one or more of the company s current products do not contain year date issues that may result in material costs to the company 
additionally  where the company is evaluating year issues for client outsourcing and services contracts  there can be no assurances that all year issues will be identified and remediated and it is possible that the company may experience increased expenses in addressing these issues 
it is possible that any such delays or increased costs could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results by  for example  impacting the company s ability to deliver products or services to its customers 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include issues originating from clients who do not migrate to current product releases or who experience other year related problems  corruption of data contained in the company s internal it systems  and failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties electricity  banking services  phone service  water systems  internet services  etc the company is in the process of contingency planning for high risk areas and should complete this effort in early item a
