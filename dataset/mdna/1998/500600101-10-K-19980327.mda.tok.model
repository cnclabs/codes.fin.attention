item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kopin is a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and small form factor displays 
the company was incorporated in to further develop and commercialize certain semiconductor expertise developed at mit 
historically  the company has derived most of its revenues from research and development contracts with agencies of the united states government 
beginning in  the company experienced a significant increase in revenues from sales of its device wafers  and in revenues from such sales for the first time exceeded revenues from research and development contracts 
more recently  the company has commenced sales of cyberdisplay products 
the company has been unprofitable since inception and  at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  for the years ended december  and  the company s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of forte  a majority owned subsidiary of the company 
as a result of declining sales and results of operations of forte  the company recorded a write down of the value of forte s assets and its investment in forte at december  totaling  in march  forte filed a voluntary petition seeking protection from its creditors under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of such filing  the financial statements of forte are not consolidated with those of the company as of december  and for the year then ended 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
the company s total revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to   excluding forte during the corresponding period in  a decrease of  the company s product revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to   excluding forte in  an increase of  product revenues from sales of the company s device wafers were  in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in product revenues was due to a  increase in sales of device wafers and display products over the corresponding period in the prior year  partially offset by the inclusion of forte revenues in the increase in sales of the company s device wafers was primarily due to the increased use of these wafers in various wireless telecommunications products  particularly by the company s major customer  rockwell 
research and development revenues were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in research and development revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in contract revenues from agencies of the federal government 
in  the company received a  multi year contract award from defense advanced research projects agency 
the company recorded revenues under this contract of  in compared to  in  a decrease of  as a result of the expirations of multi year contracts with the federal government and the company s increased emphasis on product revenues  the company believes that research and development revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues for the near future 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to the company s products  was  for the year ended december  compared to   excluding forte in the improvement in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in was primarily due to increased sales of device wafers  resulting in lower unit costs  and the inclusion in the financial results of shipments of head mounted display systems by forte 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses incurred in support of internal development programs and programs funded by agencies of the federal government  including development programs for display devices and products  device wafers and head mounted display systems  circuit design costs  staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  and fabrication and packaging of the company s display products 
funded research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in funded research and development expenses in was primarily due to a reduction in programs funded by agencies of the federal government 
internal research and development expenses were  in compared to   excluding forte in  a decrease of  the decrease in internal research and development expenses was primarily a result of reduced development costs incurred for fabrication and packaging of the company s display products  as well as the inclusion of  of such expenses incurred by forte during the corresponding period in general  administrative and selling 
general  administrative and selling expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company s business development and sales personnel  marketing expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
general  administrative and selling expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to   excluding forte in  a decrease of  the decrease in general  administrative and selling expenses in was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of  incurred by forte in in addition  general  administrative and selling expenses include non cash charges for compensation expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended relating to the issuance of certain stock options

as a result of the expirations of multi year contracts with the federal government and the company s increased emphasis on product revenues  the company believes that research and development revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues for the near future 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues in was   excluding forte compared to  in the increase in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in was primarily due to scale up of manufacturing capacity without a commensurate level of sales of head mounted display systems by forte to absorb manufacturing overhead 
research and development 
funded research and development expenses were  in compared to  in  a decrease of  as a result of a corresponding reduction in research and development revenues 
internal research and development expenses were   excluding forte in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in internal research and development expenses was primarily due to increased development of the company s display products and device wafers  including increases in circuit design costs  staffing  purchases of materials and supplies  and fabrication and packaging of the company s displays 
general  administrative and selling 
general  administrative and selling expenses were   excluding forte in compared to  in  a decrease of  general  administrative and selling expenses decreased as a result of the reclassifications of costs incurred relating to the company s lease of a manufacturing facility in october  and the modification of the facility prior to the commencement of development and manufacturing activities 
these costs were classified as cost of sales and research and development expense in and as general and administrative in other 
other expenses were   excluding forte in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in was primarily due to higher amortization expenses incurred in related to the goodwill resulting from the company s investment in forte 
other income  net 
other income  net was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in was primarily due to lower interest income earned as a result of lower cash balances during the period in comparison to balances in liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private offerings of its equity securities  research and development contract revenues  and sales of its wafer engineered device wafers and display devices and products 
as of december   sales of equity securities have raised approximately  from i private equity financings prior to the company s initial public offering  ii the company s initial public offering in april  iii the company s march public offering  iv the exercise of a  share stock warrant in december  v  from private stock sales to telecom holding co  ltd 
and united microelectronics corporation and its affiliate in  and vi the periodic exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plans 
in february  the company completed a further public offering of its common stock involving net proceeds to the company of approximately  as of december   the company had cash and equivalents and marketable securities of  and working capital of  compared to  and  as of december  during  cash and equivalents and marketable securities decreased  the decrease in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to  of cash used in operations primarily as a result of net operating losses  and  for capital expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by proceeds from exercise of stock options of  the company also has  of marketable securities held in escrow as equipment financing collateral which is shown in other assets 
the company periodically enters into various long term debt arrangements to finance equipment purchases and other activities 
as of december   long term debt obligations totaled  of which  is payable in the next twelve months 
in december  the company received a commitment letter for a  term loan facility from a commercial lender 
under the terms of the proposed facility  the loan would be payable on a quarterly basis with a floating interest rate to be based on libor  and would be secured by the company s accounts receivable 
the company completed this transaction in february in october  the company entered into a five year lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility 
this facility  which includes  square feet of environmentally controlled clean rooms  is used primarily for the company s production of display devices 
this facility is occupied under a lease that expires in october  with renewable options for up to five additional years at the company s election 
the company will make lease payments of  per year over the remaining term of the lease 
the company currently expects to expend approximately  on capital expenditures in  primarily for the acquisition of equipment relating to the manufacturing  packaging and testing of cyberdisplay products and production of the company s device wafers 
as of december   the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which became effective during the fourth quarter of the new pronouncement s requirements will not impact the company s previously reported loss per share 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which is effective for the company for the period commencing january  sfas no 
has no impact on net income and requires that certain components of stockholders equity from non owner sources be reclassified and presented as other comprehensive income 
currently  the company s consolidated balance sheets contain no material components of stockholders equity that would be reclassified as other comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which is effective for the company for the period commencing january  the impact of sfas no 
on the company has not yet been determined 
the company is conducting a review of its computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the company presently believes  with modification to existing software and converting to new software  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
seasonality the company s business is not seasonal in nature 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflationary forces 
risk factors certain of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
potential lack of market acceptance 
the company s product sales have been derived primarily from its custom wafer engineered device wafers 
to date  the company has had limited sales of its display products 
the cyberdisplay product is a miniature display which uses a lens and backlight to deliver high resolution data and video images 
the company s success will in large part depend on the widespread adoption of this viewing format in the marketplace as compared to a direct view display 
the company s success will also be dependent upon the widespread acceptance of its customers products 
the company s competitors are investing substantial resources in the development and manufacture of displays using a number of different technologies 
in the event these efforts result in the development of products that offer advantages over the company s products  and the company is unable to improve its technology or develop or acquire alternative technology that is competitive  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
kopin s prospective customers for its display products are principally manufacturers in the wireless handset  pager  digital camera  smart card and other consumer electronics industries that would use cyberdisplay products in their products 
these companies may be reluctant to adopt kopin s products because of perceived risks relating to the introduction of the company s display technology generally  concerns about end user acceptance of cyberdisplay products and the complexity  reliability  usefulness and cost effectiveness of the company s display products compared to traditional amlcds 
in addition  these companies may be reluctant to rely upon a relatively small company such as kopin for a critical component 
there can be no assurance that the company s prospective customers will adopt cyberdisplay products or that the end users of these prospective customers will accept cyberdisplay products 
the failure of kopin to achieve such market acceptance of cyberdisplay products will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
kopin s customers for its hbt device wafer products are principally manufacturers of integrated circuits for the telecommunications and data communications markets 
current and prospective customers may be reluctant to adopt kopin s products to an extent greater than at present because of perceived risks relating to gaas technology generally or hbt gaas technology in particular 
in addition  these customers may be reluctant to rely upon a relatively small company such as kopin for a critical component 
there can be no assurance that additional companies in kopin s target markets will adopt its hbt technology or that the companies that currently use the company s hbt device wafer products will continue to do so in the future 
history of operating losses  accumulated deficit 
the company has not been profitable in any quarter of its last five fiscal years 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  for the years ended december    and  the company incurred net losses of   and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
if the company continues to incur losses  the company is likely to require additional financing and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to secure additional financing or that such financing will be available on favorable terms 
potential fluctuations in results of operations 
the company s quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a wide variety of factors that could have a material adverse effect on total revenues and profitability from period to period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  availability of integrated circuit foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  the company s ability to successfully reduce costs  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
sales of end user products incorporating the company s products may exhibit cyclical fluctuations based on factors such as capital expenditure cycles of customers and new product introductions 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of a product  and as a result  the average selling prices of the company s products are likely to be subject to pricing pressures in the future 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and the company generally permits orders to be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
because the company is continuing to invest in capital equipment and to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected if increased sales are not achieved 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company may experience fluctuations in future results of operations on a quarterly or annual basis which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantial reliance on certain customers 
relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
for the years ended december  and  revenues from multiple contracts with various united states governmental agencies accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
sales to rockwell accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects that device wafer sales to rockwell will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for the near future 
a reduction in research and development contracts from the united states government or a reduction or delay in orders from rockwell or the company s other customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor or display industries  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
although some of the company s customers have entered into agreements obligating them to purchase a certain amount of the company s products  the company s customers generally do not enter into such agreements 
in addition  customer orders generally can be canceled and volume levels changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced orders cannot be assured 
the company s results of operations have been adversely affected in the past by the failure of anticipated orders to be realized and by deferrals or cancellations of orders as a result of changes in customer requirements 
canceled  delayed  or reduced commitments from any of the company s major customers  particularly rockwell  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
uncertain demand for high information content in portable products 
the company s success in the display business will depend on the availability of cost effective wireless applications that support customer demand for high resolution portable displays 
deployment of higher bandwidth infrastructure will be needed to drive the development of value added wireless services such as wireless e mail  facsimile and internet access to increase the demand for the company s display products 
the company s success will depend in large part on the widespread implementation of this infrastructure and the cost effectiveness to the end user of these services 
either a delay in such deployment or an unacceptably high cost to the consumer would delay the rate of market adoption of products based on kopin s display technology 
dependence on marketing and distribution relationships 
the company has entered into agreements with motorola  siemens  fujifilm and gemplus for the marketing and distribution of certain of its current and anticipated display products  and intends to continue to pursue these arrangements with other potential customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining current alliances or forming additional relationships or that the company s strategic customers will devote adequate resources to accomplish such marketing and distribution or be successful in such efforts 
the failure of the company to enter into these key relationships or the failure of these customers to devote adequate resources to market or distribute the company s products could have a have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
manufacturing risks  manufacturing capacity limitations 
the company is subject to significant manufacturing risks 
the manufacturing processes utilized by the company are highly complex and are periodically modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
process changes or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields 
from time to time  the company has experienced these problems  many of which are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
in particular  new process technologies or new products can be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in product introduction  delivery delays or yield fluctuations  including problems associated with increases in production volumes and increases in the complexity of the company s products 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the shortage of raw materials such as unprocessed wafers and packaging used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected if it were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of its facilities 
the company currently manufactures all of its device wafers at its manufacturing facility located in taunton  massachusetts 
the company intends to increase its production capacity in its taunton facility to produce device wafers up to six inches in diameter 
along with adding production equipment  the company will be required to successfully hire  train and manage additional production personnel in order to successfully increase its production capacity in accordance with its time schedule 
the company has no prior experience in producing finished six inch device wafers 
in the event the company s expansion plans are not implemented on a timely basis for any reason  the company could become subject to production capacity constraints 
such constraints could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has limited experience manufacturing display products 
the company is subject to the risk that the manufacture of such a small display may not ever be commercially viable  as kopin believes that no other company currently manufactures a display of a size equivalent to the cyberdisplay product at commercial quantities and prices 
the company s fabrication facility in westborough  massachusetts is used in the development and packaging of cyberdisplay products 
the integrated circuit portion of the cyberdisplay product is commercially produced by umc 
the company is also establishing packaging capability of cyberdisplay products at umc s affiliate  unipac 
there are certain significant risks associated with the company s reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
in addition  the operations of umc and unipac  both located in taiwan  are subject to risks associated with international commerce  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs and trade policies  and political and economic instability 
there can be no assurance that umc and unipac will be able to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis to meet the company s requirements 
the company is dependent on these third party manufacturers for the fabrication of integrated circuits and the packaging of its display products 
the termination or cancellation of the company s agreements with these companies  or the inability of these companies to produce required components  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture its products and would require the company to establish alternative manufacturing relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to establish such relationships on acceptable terms  in any event  the time required to establish such substitute relationships could substantially delay the commercialization of the company s display products  which in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large asian electronics companies including sharp corporation  hitachi  ltd  seiko corporation  toshiba corporation toshiba  sony corporation  nec corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
and display technologies  inc  a joint venture of ibm corporation and toshiba 
most of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing  and personnel resources than the company 
competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics  product quality and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
the success of the company s display product offerings will also depend upon its ability to compete against other types of more well established products such as traditional amlcd based products as well as the adoption of the cyberdisplay product in the industry as an alternative to traditional amlcd based products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against these companies 
there are also a number of alternative display technologies in production and under development including passive matrix liquid crystal display lcd  light emitting diode led  reflective  field emission display  plasma  organic led and virtual retinal displays  some of which target the high performance small form factor display markets in which the company s display products are sold 
there are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies 
the cyberdisplay product will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against these companies 
with respect to its device wafer products  the company presently competes with several companies  including the furakawa electric co  ltd  epitronics  emcore corporation  epitaxial products international and hitachi cable  as well as integrated circuit manufacturers with in house wafer growth capabilities  such as trw inc and fujitsu limited 
in the device wafer business  competition could become increasingly intense as new entrants emerge to address the high growth markets that kopin s products address 
the production of gaas integrated circuits has been and continues to be more costly than the production of silicon integrated circuits 
although the company has reduced production costs of its hbt device wafers by achieving higher volumes  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to decrease production costs 
in addition  the company believes the costs of producing gaas integrated circuits by its customers will continue to exceed the costs associated with the production of competing silicon integrated circuits 
as a result  the company must target markets where the higher cost associated with gaas integrated circuits is justified by their superior performance 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to identify markets which require performance superior to that offered by silicon solutions or that the company will continue to offer products which provide superior performance to offset the cost differentials 
the gaas materials industry has been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enhance its products to include these advances on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies  products or processes 
new products and rapid technological change 
the advanced semiconductor wafer and display industries have been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
the company believes that these trends will continue 
the company s ability to compete will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer requirements 
successful product commercialization depends on a number of factors  including new product definition  timely completion  introduction and market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products 
there can be no assurance that the company will adjust to changing market conditions or be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
dependence on wireless communications markets 
substantially all of the company s product revenues are presently derived from  and are expected to continue to be derived from  sales of products for wireless communications applications 
these markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and short product life cycles 
in addition  the wireless communications equipment markets have undergone a period of rapid growth and consolidation in the last few years 
the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in these markets 
products for wireless communications applications are based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s products unmarketable or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards and the failure of the company to introduce such products on a timely basis  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
uncertainty relating to patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and manufacturing processes 
to that end  the company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate 
with respect to cyberdisplay products  the company relies upon a combination of patent applications  patents and trade secrets to protect its related technology and many of the applications for these products 
with respect to wafer engineered materials  the company primarily relies on trade secrets to protect its processing technology 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and there can be no assurance that patents will issue from currently pending or future applications or that the company s existing patents or any new patents that may be issued will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
the company may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue and since publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature lags behind actual discoveries  the company cannot be certain that it was the first to conceive of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications or those of its licensors will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not obtain patents that would require the company to license  circumvent or cease manufacturing and sales of products covered by such patents  or that such licenses  if needed  would be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all 
there can be no assurance that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property rights 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or design around any patents issued to the company 
the company s products might infringe the patent rights of others  whether existing now or in the future 
for the same reasons  the products of others could infringe the patent rights of the company 
although the company is not aware of any pending or threatened patent litigation against the company  the company may be notified  from time to time  that it could be or is infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of resources of  the company even if the outcome is favorable to the company  may be necessary to enforce patents or other intellectual property rights of the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
these problems can be particularly severe in foreign countries 
in the event of an adverse ruling in litigation against the company for patent infringement  the company might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to patents of third parties covering the infringing technology 
no assurance can be given that licenses will be obtainable on acceptable terms  or at all  or that damages for infringement will not be assessed or that litigation will not occur 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also attempts to protect its proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws 
company employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while in the employ of the company 
agreements with consultants generally provide that rights to inventions made by them while consulting for the company will be assigned to the company unless such assignment is prohibited by the terms of any agreements with their regular employers 
agreements with employees  consultants and collaborators contain provisions intended to protect further the confidentiality of the company s proprietary information 
to date  the company has had no experience in enforcing such agreements 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breaches  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
loss of exclusivity of mit license 
in  the company obtained a license to certain patents and patent applications from the massachusetts institute of technology mit for device wafers and related technology to make  have made  use and sell products for the life of the patents 
the company s revenues from products covered under this exclusive license arrangement have not been material to date 
this license is exclusive with respect to commercial applications until april  and becomes non exclusive thereafter 
there can be no assurance that mit will continue to license such technology to the company on an exclusive basis after such date 
although revenues from the company s products covered under this exclusive license arrangement have not been material to date  the company believes that the loss of such exclusivity could result in competitors of the company developing competing products utilizing this technology if mit were to grant additional licenses 
should mit license such technology to third parties  there can be no assurance that such licensing will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees  including john cc fan  the company s president and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not maintain any key man insurance policies on dr 
fan or any other employees 
in addition  the company s success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
risks associated with managing an expanding business 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
the company has historically derived its revenues primarily from research and development contracts with various agencies of the federal government and sales of its device wafers 
in order to achieve its business objectives  the company must continue to undergo substantial changes in its operations to transition to a company which develops and manufactures advanced semiconductor device wafer products and small form factor displays and markets them to a broader commercial marketplace 
this transition has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant strain on the company s limited administrative  operational and financial resources 
future expansion by the company may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources  including required spending on capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support the company s operations 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to finance such improvements 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with possible acquisitions and investments 
the company may pursue potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
the company currently has no commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify any appropriate acquisition candidates 
if the company identifies an acquisition candidate  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully negotiate the terms of any such acquisition  finance such acquisition or integrate such acquired businesses  products or technologies into the company s existing business and products 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business could cause diversion of management s time and resources  and require the company to use its capital to consummate a potential acquisition 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets 
for example  the company recorded a write down of  in associated with its investment in forte technologies  inc  a developer of virtual reality head mounted systems and peripherals for the computer and entertainment markets 
in addition  the company has made  and may from time to time in the future make  investments in companies engaged in certain aspects of the flat panel display and electronics industries as part of its business strategy 
if the company were to complete any acquisitions or investments in the future  there can be no assurance that  whether or not consummated  any such acquisition or investment would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental regulation 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that its activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any failure of the company to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject it to significant future liabilities 
in addition  although the company believes that its past operations conformed with then applicable environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company has not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations  which violations could result in remediation or other liabilities  or that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will not result in remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations 
stock price volatility 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the wireless communications  semiconductor and display markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
