in december the company adopted a plan to discontinue the operations in of one of its new jersey facilities  prometcor  and to comply with isra formerly ecra and all other applicable laws 
in october prometcor entered into a memorandum of agreement with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep as to its njdep related environmental compliance activities respecting its newark facility 
in november prometcor submitted a preliminary assessment  site investigation and remedial investigation report pa si rir to the njdep following extensive testing

the usepa identified manifests dated from through which allegedly indicate that waste originating at the location of the company s former duarte  california  hydraulic subsidiary was delivered to the site 
the company sold the duarte  california  hydraulic subsidiary to the boeing corporation in as a result of successfully challenging the usepa s original volumetric allocation  on september   the usepa reduced the volume of waste attributed to the duarte facility  ronson hydraulic units corporation rhucor ca  and determined the volume to be de minimis 
in addition  counsel for this matter has informed the company that factual arguments are available that could further reduce the amount of waste attributed to the hydraulic subsidiary  and that arguments also exist that the subsequent owners of the facility should be required to pay a significant portion  or possibly all  of the costs the usepa determines to be due as a result of rhucor ca s waste having been sent to the site 
although the company s final contribution amount  if any  is not yet determinable  in the general notice letter  the usepa offered to partially settle the matter if the company paid  which would have been full settlement of the fifth partial consent decree 
this offer  however  was made prior to the usepa reduction of the volume of waste allocated to rhucor ca and prior to the usepa determination that the waste volume is de minimis 
no further communication was received by the company related to this matter in or because the usepa has determined that the volume of waste generated by the facility and sent to the site is de minimis  and because the usepa has sent a general notice letter to another prp for the same waste  the company believes that the cost  if any  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position

the matter was settled in october and the settlement did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company is a defendant in three product liability cases now pending alleging the wrongful deaths of teenagers resulting from their abuse of multi fill butane by deliberate inhalation 
the plaintiffs have claimed unspecified damages 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist
