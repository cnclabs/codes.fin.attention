item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
except as specifically indicated  the forward looking statements contained in this discussion do not take into consideration the impact of compaq s agreement to merge with digital equipment corporation as described in item  which is subject to the approval of digital s shareholders as well as certain regulatory approvals 
we expect to consummate the merger in the second quarter of results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of sales  selected consolidated financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december year ended december  sales

represents a million charge related to restructuring actions taken by tandem during represents a million non recurring  non tax deductible charge related to costs associated with the tandem merger during sales sales for increased approximately billion or over the prior year as compared with an increase of billion or during north american sales  which include canada  increased during  compared with an increase of during international sales  excluding canada  represented of total sales in as compared with in european sales increased during compared to an increase of during other international sales increased during  compared with an increase of during other international markets experienced adverse market conditions in in particular  the weakness in the asian and japanese markets resulted in an aggressive pricing environment throughout the personal computer industry is highly competitive and marked by frequent product introductions  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics and a large number of competitors 
approximately of compaq s cpu sales in were derived from products introduced in these new products have been designed to allow us to achieve low product costs while maintaining the quality and reliability for which our products have been known  thereby increasing our ability to compete on price and value 
the significant increase in sales in stemmed primarily from an increase in the number of units sold and an increase in sales of options associated with cpu products 
in  compaq s worldwide unit sales increased while they increased in the increase included a expansion in unit sales of commercial cpu products  a increase for consumer cpu products and a increase for enterprise cpu products 
according to third party estimates  worldwide unit sales of personal computers increased approximately to in  in contrast to a to increase in competition continues to have a significant impact on prices of our products  especially those aimed at the consumer market  and additional pricing actions may occur as we attempt to maintain our competitive mix of price performance characteristics 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of any pricing actions through implementation of design to cost goals  the aggressive pursuit of reduced component costs  manufacturing efficiencies and control of operating expenses 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was in  up from in the increase in gross margins primarily resulted from a higher portion of sales of enterprise products and options  production and logistics cost savings  and overall asset management improvements 
compaq operates in a very aggressive pricing environment that will continue to put pressure on gross margins 
despite this pressure  we expect that the combination of changes in product mix  continued improvements in logistics and asset management  reductions in the cost of materials  and higher margins on new products should allow compaq to maintain relatively stable gross margin levels in operating expenses research and development costs increased in absolute dollars to million from million and fell as a percentage of sales to from in as compared to in addition  compaq spent million on in process research and development in connection with an acquisition in we are committed to continuing a significant research and development program  and research and development costs are likely to increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars in while slightly declining as a percentage of sales 
the decrease as a percentage of sales reflects our ongoing efforts to manage operating expense growth relative to sales and gross margin levels 
the increase in the amount of expense resulted from domestic and international selling expense associated with higher unit volumes as well as expense incurred in connection with the introduction of new products  the entry into new markets  the expansion of distribution channels and a greater emphasis on customer service and technical support 
we anticipate that in selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as compaq supports significant new product introductions  expands into new markets and increases investment in the area of service and support  especially in support of compaq s enterprise business 
other items in  compaq had other income of million  compared to other expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the difference was primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income related to higher combined cash and short term investment balances  partially offset by increased interest expense 
the translation gains and losses relating to the financial statements of compaq s international subsidiaries  net of offsetting gains and losses associated with hedging activities relating to the net monetary assets of these subsidiaries  are included in other income and expense and resulted in net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources compaq s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to positive cash flow from operating activities  including improved management of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
accounts receivable decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily as a result of improved asset management and the sale of billion of accounts receivable at the end of inventory levels increased to billion from billion during that period  primarily due to increased unit volumes 
inventory turns increased to in  from in cash used in for the purchase of property  plant and equipment totaled million 
capital expenditures for land  buildings and equipment during are estimated to be million 
compaq has committed for only a small portion of such amounts and the actual level of spending will depend on a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and compaq s business 
accounts payable increased to billion from billion and days payable outstanding increased to days from days at december  and  respectively  due to improved accounts payable management 
in addition  in may  compaq completed a cash tender offer for substantially all of its outstanding million senior notes due march  and million senior notes due march  compaq paid approximately million excluding accrued interest for the tendered notes 
also in may  compaq completed its cash tender offer for microcom for million 
we currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
compaq from time to time may borrow funds for actual or anticipated funding needs or because it is economically beneficial to borrow funds instead of repatriating funds in the form of dividends from compaq s foreign subsidiaries 
on september   compaq entered into a five year billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a one year billion unsecured revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the closing of the new facilities  compaq retired its two existing secured revolving credit facilities totaling billion 
compaq had no borrowings outstanding under either of the new facilities at december  compaq has established a commercial paper program  supported by the syndicated credit facility  which was unused at december  we believe that these sources of credit provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet foreseeable future funding requirements 
we continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will pursue those we consider appropriate based upon compaq s needs and market conditions 
factors that may affect future results compaq participates in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by fierce industry wide competition for market share 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices  continually changing customer demand patterns  growing competition from well capitalized high technology and consumer electronics companies  and rapid technological development carried out in the midst of legal battles over intellectual property rights 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report 
competitive environment 
we expect the personal computer market to continue to expand in in line with third party research organizations forecasts of unit growth in the range of to 
we expect the enterprise market to expand in line with the development of internet and intranet enterprise applications and the corporate mis migration from legacy systems to client server systems 
with the tandem merger and the anticipated digital merger  compaq confronts a challenge in building its high end unix solutions product market while continuing to advance the sphere of nt based solutions to achieve the lowest cost of ownership and highest computing value for its customers 
industry competition remains fierce with a large number of competitors vying for market share 
this competition creates an aggressive pricing environment  which continues to put pressure on compaq s gross margins 
although compaq has programs and products focused on meeting market demand  gaining market share profitably and maintaining gross margins  compaq s ability to achieve these goals is subject to the risks set forth in this discussion 
risks of newly acquired businesses 
compaq plans to use strategic acquisitions and mergers to assist in the growth of its business 
during the third quarter  compaq completed its merger with tandem 
tandem s core competencies have historically centered around providing reliable  scaleable hardware and software solutions for business critical applications  such as online transaction processing 
with the advent of the internet and expanding corporate intranets  compaq believes that computer applications will emerge that will result in media rich high volume transactions  causing online transaction processing to be expanded to include internet transaction processing 
as a result of the tandem merger  compaq is engaged in direct sales of computer systems with software developed to meet customers specific needs 
the longer term nature of fulfilling such contracts may expose compaq to new risks associated with customized specifications 
compaq believes that through its tandem and enterprise products  it is well positioned to provide computing solutions to meet this demand as well as other needs for enterprise computing 
subject to certain regulatory approvals and approval by digital shareholders  compaq will expand its service offerings and enterprise solutions through the merger with digital 
at that time  compaq will confront a number of risks associated with digital s business 
compaq believes that the digital merger will enhance its operating results  but as with any significant acquisition or merger  compaq confronts challenges in retaining key employees  synchronizing product roadmaps and business processes  and integrating logistics  marketing  product development  and manufacturing operations to achieve greater efficiencies 
inventory 
in the event of a drop in worldwide demand for computer products  demand for one or more of compaq s products is lower than anticipated  difficulties arise in managing product transitions  or component pricing movements affect the value of raw material inventory  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash  and related profitability 
third party relationships 
we work with third parties as suppliers in arrangements to provide services in areas other than core competencies and ensure the service and support of our customers  and in strategic alliances to facilitate product offerings  product development  compatibility  and the adoption of industry standards 
although we try to achieve strong working relationships with parties who share our industry goals and have adequate resources to fulfill their responsibilities  these relationships lead to a number of risks 
first  these companies may suffer financial or operational difficulties that affect their performance at the speed and volumes required by compaq s business  which could lead to delays in product development and gaps in component supplies 
second  major companies from which we purchase components or services such as intel  microsoft  cisco and ibm may be competitors in other areas  which could affect pricing  new product development or future performance 
finally  difficulties in coordinating activities may lead to gaps in delivery and performance of our products 
rapid technology cycles 
we believe the computer industry will continue to drive rapid technology cycles 
in planning product transitions  we evaluate the speed at which customers are likely to switch to newer products 
the contrast between prices of old and new products  which is related to component costs  is a critical variable in predicting customer decisions to move to the next generation of products 
because of the lead times associated with our volume production  should we be unable to gauge the rate of product transitions accurately  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash  and profitability 
product transitions 
in each product cycle  we confront the risk of delays in production that could impact sales of newer products while we manage the inventory of older products and facilitate the sale of older inventory held by resellers 
to ease product transitions  we carry out pricing actions and marketing programs to increase sales in reseller channels 
we provide currently for estimated product returns and price protection that may occur under reseller programs and under floor planning arrangements with third party finance companies 
should we be unable to sell the inventory of older products at anticipated prices or if dealers hold higher than expected amounts of inventory subject to price protection at the time of planned price reductions  there could be a resulting adverse impact on sales  gross margins  and profitability 
systems implementation 
compaq continues to focus on making its business and information management processes more efficient in order to increase customer satisfaction  improve productivity  and lower costs 
in the event of a delay in implementing improvements  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash  and related profitability 
in connection with these efforts  we are moving many of our systems from a legacy environment of proprietary systems to client server architectures as well as integrating systems from newly acquired businesses 
should the transition to new systems not occur in a smooth and orderly manner  we could experience disruptions in operations  which could have an adverse financial impact 
technology standards and key licenses 
participants in the computer industry generally rely on the creation and implementation of technology standards to win the broadest market acceptance for their products 
compaq must successfully manage and participate in the development of standards while continuing to differentiate its products in a manner valued by customers 
while industry participants generally accept  and may encourage  the use of their intellectual property by third parties under license  when intellectual property owned by competitors or suppliers becomes accepted as an industry standard  compaq must obtain a license  purchase components utilizing such technology from the owners of such technology or their licensees  or otherwise acquire rights to use such technology  which could result in increased costs 
compaq has entered into license agreements with key industry participants  including intel  texas instruments and microsoft 
compaq has been negotiating with ibm and microsoft for the successors to the current agreements 
there can be no assurance that compaq will be able to negotiate terms under such license agreements that offer it competitive market advantages 
production forecasts 
in managing production  we must forecast customer demand for our products 
should we underestimate the supplies needed to meet demand  we could be unable to meet customer demand 
should we overestimate the supplies needed to meet customer demand  cash and profitability could be adversely affected 
many of the components used in our products  particularly microprocessors and memory  experience steep price declines over their product lives 
if we are unable to manage purchases and utilization of such components efficiently to maintain low inventory levels immediately prior to major price declines  we could be unable to take immediate advantage of such declines to lower product costs  which could adversely affect our sales and gross margins 
in addition  should prices for components increase unexpectedly  compaq s gross margin could be adversely affected 
in  compaq established a variety of programs designed to increase its manufacturing  distribution  and business process efficiencies 
the success of these programs depends upon the implementation of more efficient component supply  manufacturing  and distribution strategies to increase overall efficiencies  which will lead to lower prices being offered to its end users 
credit risks 
compaq s primary means of distribution remains third party resellers 
we continually monitor and manage the credit we extend to resellers and attempt to limit credit risks by broadening distribution channels  utilizing certain risk transfer arrangements and obtaining security interests 
our business could be adversely affected in the event that the financial condition of third party computer resellers erodes 
upon the financial failure of a major reseller  we could experience disruptions in distribution as well as the loss of the unsecured portion of any outstanding accounts receivable 
geographic expansion  particularly the expansion of manufacturing operations in developing countries  such as brazil and china  and the expansion of sales into economically volatile areas such as asia  latin america and other emerging markets  subject compaq to a number of economic and other risks  such as financial instability among resellers in these regions 
compaq generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in emerging markets  in particular asia pacific and latin america  when compared to us and european markets 
in addition  geographic expansion subjects compaq to political and financial instability of the countries into which compaq expands  including currency devaluation and interest rate fluctuations 
compaq continues to evaluate its business operations in these regions and attempts to take measures to limit risks in these areas 
year compliance 
compaq believes the cost of administering its year readiness program described above  exclusive of any customer claims  will not have a material adverse impact on future earnings 
since there is no uniform definition of year compliance and since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products  compaq may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
such claims  if successful  could have a material adverse impact on future results 
see item business year transition for additional information 
projects to address compaq s internal information systems currently are underway  and compaq is in the process of replacing some of its older systems with new systems that are able to handle the year transition 
compaq will continue to review internal system requirements and to correct further issues as they are identified 
although compaq s evaluation of these systems is still in process  we believe that the impact of the year transition on its internal systems will not have a material adverse impact on future results 
in addition  compaq s task force is evaluating the impact of year compliance of its suppliers  is asking its suppliers about compliance  and is establishing year compliance requirements for suppliers 
since the compliance of suppliers depends upon their cooperation  failures remain a possibility  and could have a material adverse impact on future results 
tax rate 
compaq currently has a effective tax rate  before the effect of non deductible purchased in process technology and merger related costs and expects this rate will continue at approximately the same level in compaq benefits from a tax holiday in singapore that expires in  with a potential extension to august if certain cumulative investment levels and other conditions are met 
compaq s tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that is derived from its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the us if the earnings of this subsidiary as a percentage of compaq s total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should compaq s ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  compaq s effective tax rate would exceed the current estimate 
in addition  should compaq s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  compaq s overall effective tax rate could increase 
currency fluctuations 
compaq s risks associated with currency fluctuations are discussed in item a below 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting compaq s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
market risk s compaq is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as wells as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions  pursuant to company policies 
compaq uses market valuations and value at risk valuation methods to assess market risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios 
it uses jp morgan s riskmetrics to estimate the value at risk based on estimates of volatility and correlation of market factors drawn from jp morgan s riskmetrics data sets as of december  our measured value at risk from holding derivative and other financial instruments  using a confidence level and assuming normal market conditions at december   was immaterial 
the value of the us dollar affects compaq s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect compaq s sales as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
compaq engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange contracts  compaq hedges those assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the income statement 
for certain markets  particularly latin america  compaq has determined that ongoing hedging of non us dollar net monetary assets is not cost effective and instead attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of local currencies 
from time to time  compaq purchases foreign currency option contracts as well as short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the anticipated sales of compaq s international marketing subsidiaries  with the exception of latin america 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of compaq s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets  and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by compaq are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although compaq maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which compaq sells products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which compaq incurs costs  compaq s sales or costs are adversely affected
