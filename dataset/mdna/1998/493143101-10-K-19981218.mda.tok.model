the company also expects to continue its assessment of external issues related to suppliers  customers  utilities and other third parties which are outside of its immediate control 
these activities are expected to continue throughout and beyond  as applicable 
the company assigns a higher level of risk to such issues since they are outside of its immediate control

the euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union  including the netherlands  are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies and the euro  leading to the adoption of the euro by these countries as their common legal currency

the terms of sales to european and other international customers of products manufactured by the company s domestic operations are typically denominated in us dollars  although exceptions do occur on an individual case basis 
the company expects that its standard terms of sales to international customers will continue substantially in their present form 
for the infrequent sales transactions between international customers and the company s domestic operations which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into a currency hedging transaction to minimize such risk 
therefore  the company does not believe that it should experience a material effect on its business which would be inherently different than risks which currently exist 
the terms of sales to european customers by key superior  the company s subsidiary in the netherlands  are typically denominated in either dutch guilders or the respective legacy currencies of its customers 
key superior s information systems software currently accommodates such multiple currency transactions and is expected to integrate euro denominated transactions with relatively minor difficulty 
the company s european subsidiary expects to implement a complete conversion to the euro in calendar  well before the january  deadline 
the company s european subsidiaries maintain long term credit facilities with a dutch bank and also long term facility and equipment leases  all of which currently specify periodic debt service or lease payments denominated in dutch guilders 
although the company expects modifications to such agreements will occur within calendar  there can be no assurance that such modifications will be accomplished within such time frame or that the interest rates or other terms of such agreements will be unaffected
