item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained herein 
the us navy accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in  and in the company s principal us navy business is currently being performed under fixed price or fixed price incentive contracts  which wholly or partially shift the risk of construction costs that exceed the contract target cost to the company 
the accompanying table summarizes the percentage of revenues by contract type 
for the year ended december contract type fixed price cost based total the company reports revenues and profits on its long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined on the basis of incurred costs to estimated final total costs 
losses on contracts are reported when first estimated 
the performance of contracts usually extends over several years  requiring periodic reviews and revisions of estimated final contract prices and costs 
the effect of revisions to estimates is included in earnings in the period the revisions are made 
product tankers commercial construction program recent events originally  this program involved the planned construction of nine commercial product tankers to be delivered under fixed price contracts entered into from to during  one of these ships was delivered to mobil oil corporation for use in the domestic market 
in march of  the company announced a revised strategy for this program that will result in only five of the remaining eight ships being built  after which the company will withdraw from the commercial ship construction market 
work is substantially complete on the first three of the remaining five ships which are scheduled to be delivered in the final two ships will be delivered by the middle of during the past several months  events occurred with respect to this program which led to increased cost estimates and the revised strategy as described above 
a majority of the estimated cost growth occurred in the materials area  and reflects the impact of supplier services  emergent material  and schedule changes for the recently designed domestic ships 
supplier services cost increases were driven by significant increases in coating and painting costs and failures by several suppliers 
emergent material costs related to finalized design specifications  as well as unanticipated costs associated with the extension of construction schedules  including warranty and preservation costs and additional inspection requirements  contributed to the cost growth 
in addition  the december change in the regulation of use by industry of paints containing volatile organic hazardous air pollutants in shipbuilding and ship repair  mandated that the paint applied to product tankers and the application methodology be amended thereby increasing material and labor costs even further 
in addition to the material problems discussed above  the labor estimates for the undelivered ships have also been revised upward reflecting the fact that productivity improvements are not being achieved at the levels previously anticipated 
as a result  man hour estimates for the ships have been increased and learning curve projections have been modified as well 
factors contributing to the productivity shortfall include the material issues described above  emergent design changes  and revised ship construction and delivery schedules 
as a result of these increased estimated costs  the company recorded additional charges against operating earnings of approximately million  net of previously established reserves of million  for the completion of the double eagle product tanker program and the cancellation costs associated with the last three ships 
in addition  the company is currently conducting internal reviews and has engaged a leading consulting firm to evaluate and make recommendations regarding engineering  sourcing  materials management  manufacturing  and overall program management 
management cannot currently predict the outcome of these reviews or their impact on the company 
compared to results of operations for the year ended december revenues millions construction  overhaul and repair engineering related businesses other total   the company s revenues decreased during  declining to billion from billion in the lower revenue level  as detailed in the following discussion of operations  is driven by construction and overhaul and repair 
construction the million decrease in construction revenues in is due to the absence of submarine construction work  as well as decreases in sealift conversion and double eagle product tanker work 
these decreases are partially offset by increased construction activity on the aircraft carrier reagan 
overhaul and repair overhaul and repair revenues declined substantially in as a result of the delivery of the aircraft carrier eisenhower in january 
the decrease is partially offset by increased overhaul activity on the aircraft carrier roosevelt and increased planning work for the aircraft carrier nimitz refueling 
engineering engineering revenues improved in  increasing to million from million in expanded engineering work related to the new attack submarine nssn  as well as increased nuclear and r d efforts  contributed to the revenue growth 
requirements for seawolf submarine design work have declined due to the maturity of the production program for this class of submarines 
related businesses other revenues from related businesses other increased by million in the higher level of activity in is due to increased efforts with respect to valve and pump repairs and other miscellaneous work 
for the year ended december operating earnings millions construction overhaul and repair engineering related businesses other total the operating loss of million in represents a million decline from the level of million in operating earnings 
this decline is primarily attributable to the million of net additional charges against operating earnings on the double eagle product tanker construction program discussed above see commercial construction program recent events on pages and 
additionally  the decline is due to lower overhaul and repair income contributions associated with the january delivery of the aircraft carrier eisenhower  and one time gains in attributable to the mix of work and maturity of several contracts 
partially offsetting the decrease is the improvement in engineering earnings 
construction the million decline in operating earnings on construction work in is a result of the recognition of losses associated with product tanker construction and lower income contributions from the lack of los angeles class submarine construction work 
the decrease is partially offset by strong carrier contributions  particularly with respect to the reagan contract and the fact that was significantly impacted by the recognition of losses associated with sealift conversion work 
overhaul and repair the million decrease in operating earnings for overhaul and repair work in is a result of the completion of the eisenhower overhaul in january of  and one time gains in attributable to the mix of work and maturity of several contracts 
the decrease is partially mitigated by increased overhaul activity on the roosevelt and planning work for the nimitz refueling 
engineering the million increase in operating earnings for engineering work reflects the increased volume in nuclear and submarine engineering activities  as well as favorable contract close outs 
related businesses other other operating losses are comparable and not significant to either period presented 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december cash flows millions net cash provided used by operating activities capital expenditures other investing cash flows subtotal financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided used by operating activities the million increase in the comparative cash flows from operating activities is due to a decreased investment in working capital partially offset by lower operating earnings 
the lower operating earnings are attributable to the factors discussed above in compared to results of operations  operating earnings 
the decrease in working capital is caused by normal timing fluctuations and management initiatives  as well as efforts by the company to reduce accounts receivable balances 
additionally  reflects lower tax payments due to the recognition of losses previously deferred for tax purposes on commercial tankers 
capital expenditures the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to is attributable to higher expenditures related to major capital improvement programs during the prior year 
the company s capital improvement program consisted principally of three separate projects i development of a state of the art automated steel cutting and fabrication facility  ii extension of a dry dock facility  and iii construction of the carrier refueling complex 
all three of these projects were substantially complete at the end of  thus explaining the current period reduction in capital investments 
other investing cash flows other investing cash flow activities in and primarily relate to an investment for a ownership interest in a vessel owning limited partnership with a us shipping firm which will own and operate four of the product tankers under construction by the company 
in addition  also included a million investment achieving the company s equity interest in the abu dhabi ship building company 
financing activities in  the company received million from the issuance of common stock related to the company s benefit plans 
these funds  as well as those generated from operations  enabled the company to pay off long term debt  purchase company stock on the open market for employee benefit plans and treasury stock  and pay annual dividends of sixteen cents per share 
the company also used treasury stock to acquire cmi in december see note acquisition to the financial statements of the company 
in  the company received from its former parent  on a net basis  million to finance operating cash flow needs and cover costs of its capital improvement program see note transactions with former parent company to the financial statements of the company 
capital requirements and resources the company requires that adequate working capital be available at all times 
while construction and conversion contracts provide for progress payments  they generally require extensive investment in contracts in process because of contract progress payment retentions and change orders 
retentions  generally due upon completion or acceptance of the contracted work  amounted to million as of december  change orders  which make up an appreciable portion of the company s work  sometimes require long periods of negotiation during which time the expended funds are not available for other uses 
the company estimates that expenditures aggregating approximately million will be required after december  to complete planned projects for which substantial commitments have been made 
the company also believes it will be required to make tax payments in the range of million to million in after completion of the stennis truman aircraft carrier contract 
on november   the company entered into a million senior credit facility credit agreement which includes a million six year revolving credit facility  of which million may be used for advances and letters of credit and million may be used for standby letters of credit 
this agreement contains customary financial and restrictive covenants which limit borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
as of december  the company had used million of the credit facility for standby letters of credit and utilized no portion of the million for advances see note long term debt and financing arrangements to the financial statements of the company 
based on financial results  the company was technically in default with respect to its debt covenants  however  a waiver was granted by the lenders in march to reinstate the company s compliance with the provisions of the credit agreement 
the waiver leaves the terms of these agreements essentially unchanged 
the product tanker charge taken in see also product tankers on pages and is also expected to have an impact on the company s cash flow for management believes that this charge and other capital requirements as described above for its overall operations  payment of dividends  taxes  and debt service can be met by existing cash  internally generated funds  and the revolving credit facility 
interest and income taxes prior to the spinoff  corporate debt of the company s former parent and its related interest expense were allocated to the company based upon the ratio of the company s net assets to the parent s consolidated net assets plus debt 
as an independent company  the company s debt level and attendant interest expense are higher than the historical allocations 
as a result  interest expense as a separate entity is higher 
the effective tax rates for and are approximately and  respectively 
the difference between the company s effective tax rate in compared to the us federal statutory rate of is principally due to state income taxes and miscellaneous permanent differences for tax 
changes in accounting principles the company adopted fas no 
 earnings per share  and fas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  in the adoption of these new standards did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement  fas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
fas no 
establishes standards for reporting and the display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
fas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the future adoption of this new standard is not expected to have any impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting by insurance and other enterprises for insurance related assessments 
the sop provides  among other things  that an entity should recognize a liability for guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this sop is required to be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sop in relation to certain department of labor annual assessments and is currently unable to determine the impact it will have on the reported financial position and results of operations of the company 
other matters the company has assessed and continues to evaluate the impact of the year issue on its systems and operations 
because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year  when the new century begins  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all 
the inability to recognize or properly treat the year issue could cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
a year plan has been developed  and based on company assessments  the costs associated with addressing this issue are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the company 
work on this effort began at the end of with remediation of systems using long lead time dates 
the target completion date for company computer systems is november  and a comprehensive off site integration test is scheduled for december expenditures so far have totaled approximately million with total projected expenditures estimated at million 
the projected expenses include payment for the remediation of outsourced applications and the cost of remediating applications in house 
a company wide steering committee has been established and an outside consultant hired to help the company formally assess the impact of the year issue outside the information technology it environment 
the consultant will provide a framework for formal risk assessment and provide input to the plan for remediation for the non it environment 
once the plan is complete  a budget for remediation of embedded systems will be established 
the consultant will also examine and validate the it plan 
in addition to addressing current company computer systems  the company is also contacting its supplier base to ensure their year compliance 
the company is also installing new hardware and software as part of its implementation of a shared data environment  which will help mitigate any potential year risks 
compared to results of operations for the year ended december revenues millions construction   overhaul and repair engineering related businesses other total   the company s revenues increased during  growing to billion from billion in the higher revenue level  as detailed in the following discussion of operations  is driven by overhaul and repair 
construction the million decrease in construction revenues in is due to the delivery of the aircraft carrier uss john c 
stennis in late  the decline in los angeles class submarine production attendant with the completion of that program in  and lower levels of activity on sealift conversions 
these decreases are partially offset by increased construction activity on the aircraft carriers truman and reagan as well as double eagle product tankers 
overhaul and repair the million increase in overhaul and repair revenues in is primarily attributable to the aircraft carrier eisenhower 
revenues generated by the eisenhower overhaul are up due to i the ship being in the yard for the full year versus six months in  and ii the period of performance being compressed from to months 
engineering engineering revenues are marginally lower in  declining to million from million in requirements for seawolf and los angeles class submarine design work have declined due to the maturity of the production programs for these submarines 
related businesses other revenues from related businesses other declined by million in the higher level of activity in is due to a variety of nonrecurring jobs for miscellaneous services 
for the year ended december operating earnings millions construction overhaul and repair engineering related businesses other total operating earnings of million in represent a decline from s level of million 
this decline in earnings is primarily attributable to losses recognized in construction  offset by improved performance in overhaul and repair 
construction the million decrease in operating earnings on construction work in relates to i the delivery of the carrier stennis in late  and ii increases in loss accruals for commercial product tanker construction see note commitments and contingencies to the financial statements of the company and sealift conversions 
the decreases in operating earnings for the period are partially offset by i increased activity and productivity improvements on the aircraft carriers reagan and truman  and ii the favorable settlement of contract change orders on delivered submarines 
overhaul and repair the million increase in operating earnings for overhaul and repair work in is a result of i higher volume on the eisenhower  ii increased activity on carrier overhaul planning work  and iii increased margins on submarine  carrier  and non nuclear surface ship overhaul and repair work 
engineering operating earnings from engineering work remained stable  as earnings contributions matched those reported in related businesses other the decrease in operating earnings in is primarily the result of the recognition of certain professional and administrative costs associated with nns becoming an independent company 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december cash flows millions net cash used provided by operating activities capital expenditures other investing cash flows subtotal financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash used provided by operating activities the million decrease in the comparative cash flows from operating activities is due to lower operating earnings and an increased investment in working capital 
the lower operating earnings are attributable to the factors discussed above in compared to results of operations  operating earnings 
the increase in working capital is caused by normal timing fluctuations in billings and collections 
additionally  prices on certain commercial construction contracts are not billable until delivery  and as such  attendant working capital costs incurred throughout the year were not billable during capital expenditures capital expenditures in remained relatively level with and reflect the company s continuing investment in a strategic capital improvement program consisting principally of three separate projects i development of a state of the art automated steel cutting and fabrication facility  ii extension of a dry dock facility  and iii construction of the consolidated refueling facility 
the automated steel cutting and fabrication facility  which is fully functional  should directly support the company s goal of reducing its production cost structure 
the extension of the dry dock facility was completed in june and allows for concurrent  multiple ship construction within the same dry dock 
this improvement is expected to enable construction resources to be utilized on multiple projects 
lastly  the consolidated refueling facility was substantially complete at the end of this cost efficient facility is strategically located next to the dry docks used to refuel nuclear powered ships 
other investing cash flows other investing cash flow activities in and include for each year a million investment towards the company s equity interest in the abu dhabi ship building company 
the remaining activity consists of a million investment in a vessel owning limited partnership with a us shipping firm 
financing activities the company received from its former parent  on a net basis  million in and million in to finance operating cash flow needs and cover costs of its capital improvement program see note transactions with former parent company to the financial statements of the company 
additionally  million was borrowed under the company s credit facility see capital requirements and resources above for working capital needs at year end 
the company also received million in long term debt proceeds during  which were used to pay a dividend to its former parent in conjunction with the spinoff see note long term debt and financing arrangements to the financial statements of the company 
interest and income taxes prior to the spinoff  corporate debt of the company s former parent and its related interest expense were allocated to the company based upon the ratio of the company s net assets to the parent s consolidated net assets plus debt 
as an independent company  the company s weighted average cost of debt is higher than the historical allocations 
as a result  interest expense as a separate entity will initially be higher 
the effective tax rates for and were approximately and  respectively 
the difference between the company s effective tax rate in these periods compared to the us federal statutory rate of is principally due to state income taxes and miscellaneous permanent differences for tax 
changes in accounting principles the company adopted fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the adoption of these new standards did not have any material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
