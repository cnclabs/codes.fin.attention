item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through its operating partnerships  the partnership is principally engaged in the transportation of refined petroleum products including gasoline  aviation turbine fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil and kerosene 
the partnership s revenues are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
results of operations are affected by factors which include general economic conditions  weather  competitive conditions  demand for products transported  seasonality and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million for volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the major portion of this increase is related to increased turbine fuel deliveries to newark  j 
f 
kennedy  miami and detroit airports 
at newark  j 
f 
kennedy and miami airports  turbine fuel demand continues to grow at a steady rate  while at detroit the increases are attributable primarily to the installation of new facilities and the attraction of a new shipper 
gasoline volumes also increased over levels 
the increase in gasoline volumes is attributable primarily to market share growth throughout pennsylvania 
the filing of tariff incentives has also led to increased volumes and revenue at various locations 
gasoline revenue overall  however  has declined slightly due to the loss of longer haul  higher tariff volumes particularly to the upstate new york area and certain midwest locations that are being supplied with shorter haul  lower tariff volumes 
distillate volumes and revenues in were comparable to volumes while liquefied petroleum gas and other product volumes declined resulting in lower revenues 
tariff rate increases implemented in also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during payroll expenses declined as the result of a staff reduction program implemented in and the non recurrence of the million charge recorded in connection with that program 
payroll and payroll overhead expenses were also lower since certain senior executive compensation costs have not been charged to the partnership since august   in accordance with the terms of the esop restructuring 
professional fee expenses also declined due to reduced expenses associated with the esop restructuring 
offsetting these decreases to some extent were increases in rental expense and the amortization of deferred charges related to the issuance of lp units under the esop restructuring 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
total other expenses increased by million 
a million gain on the sale of property in did not recur in in addition  increased incentive compensation payments to the general partner as a result of greater cash distributions to unitholders  and the settlement of a lawsuit brought in connection with the esop restructuring  increased expenses 
see certain relationships and related transactions 
offsetting these increases  to some extent  was a decline in minority interest expense related to the decline in net income 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volume delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent less than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the decline in revenue was related to decreases in gasoline deliveries  offset somewhat by increases in distillate  turbine fuel  liquefied petroleum gas and other petroleum product deliveries 
tariff rate increases implemented in and also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
declines in gasoline deliveries were related in part to severe winter storms  particularly in the northeast  where ground traffic was curtailed during january and february 
increased canadian imports and the loss of business to other competing pipeline systems also reduced gasoline volumes transported by the partnership 
continued market growth in pennsylvania offset these volume declines to some extent 
distillate volumes rose in compared with primarily as the result of the colder winter in and heating oil inventory restocking occurring during the fourth quarter 
turbine fuel volumes were higher than on increased deliveries to newark  j 
f 
kennedy and miami airports 
some turbine fuel volumes were lost to additional barging at pittsburgh and a decline in demand at laguardia airport 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent greater than costs and expenses of million during during the second quarter  the partnership recorded a one time expense of million related to an employee early retirement and termination program 
in addition  increases in payroll overheads and professional fees related to the esop were offset by declines in payroll  taxes  power  supplies and travel 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
total other expenses declined million in as compared to this favorable variance is primarily related to a million gain on the sale of land no longer needed for the partnership s operations 
tariff changes the operating partnerships did not increase tariff rates during however  effective january  certain of the operating partnerships implemented tariff increases that are expected to generate approximately million in additional revenue per year 
in the years and  certain tariffs were increased that  at the time of filing  were projected to generate approximately million and million in additional revenue per year  respectively 
competition and other business conditions bp america bp has announced that it plans to shut down its lima  ohio refinery in and supply its marginal refined petroleum product requirements via pipeline from sources outside ohio 
bp s decision regarding replacement supply and distribution has the potential to increase or decrease buckeye s midwest volumes and revenue 
based on information currently available  it is not possible to predict the timing or financial impact to the partnership of the shutdown of bp s lima refinery 
however  the general partner does not believe that a shutdown of the bp refinery will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
several major refiners and marketers of petroleum products have announced strategic alliances or mergers in these alliances or mergers have the potential to alter refined product supply and distribution patterns within the operating partnerships market area 
based on information currently available  it is not possible to predict the impact  if any  these alliances or mergers would have on the operating partnerships business 
however  the general partner does not believe that these alliances or mergers will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition

see business capital expenditures 
planned capital expenditures include  among other things  installation of transmix tanks  renewal and replacement of several tank roofs and seals  upgrades to field instrumentation and cathodic protection systems  installation and replacement of mainline pipe and valves  facility automation and various facility improvements that facilitate increased pipeline volumes 
capital expenditures are expected to remain at this higher level for the next few years as a result of the general partner s plan to automate certain facilities in order to more effectively control operating costs 
environmental matters the operating partnerships are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment

various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating partnerships or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating partnerships and their predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to each site  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or of any future claims and proceedings
