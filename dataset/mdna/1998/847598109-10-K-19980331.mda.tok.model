item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview currently  spectran develops  manufactures  and markets high quality optical fiber  optical fiber cables and value added optical fiber components and assemblies 
prior to  the company had a narrow customer base and was focused on the production of multimode fiber for the domestic market 
in the company began to implement a strategic plan to diversify its products  markets and customer base 
as part of this plan  the company reintroduced single mode fiber in and began marketing it internationally 
in the company acquired ensign bickford s specialty fiber operations which later became spectran specialty  allowing the company to become a world wide leader in fiber optic specialty applications 
the company entered the fiber optic cable market in may by acquiring apd in order to participate more extensively in the rapid growth of the data communications market  the principal end market of multimode fiber 
in december the company formed general photonics  a joint venture with general cable  to develop  manufacture and market fiber optic cable 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses research and development cost income from operations other income expense  net

this was partially offset by lower margins at spectran specialty  primarily due to greater than planned costs incurred in connection with the consolidation and expansion into a new facility 
as a percentage of net sales  royalties decreased from in to in this decrease in royalties as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in in the net sales not subject to royalties

when fully operational  the expansion at spectran communication will increase capacity there by 
the company has and intends to continue to finance these expansions through a combination of cash flow from operations  borrowings and existing cash and marketable security balances 
other matters management is aware of the potential software logic anomalies associated with the year date change 
the company is in the process of evaluating the potential issues that might need to be addressed in connection with its operations 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing the issue are not expected to have any material effect upon the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods
