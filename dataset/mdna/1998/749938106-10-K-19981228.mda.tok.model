the company s business has grown rapidly  resulting in increases in revenues during each of the last three fiscal years 
the increase in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  has largely been driven by increases in call volumes from existing clients  primarily in the insurance industry  coupled with the development of new clients primarily in the financial services  membership services and telecommunications industry 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historical profit margins  which may be adversely affected by  among other factors  the pricing of such business and additional technological  labor and other costs involved in servicing such business 
operating income exclusive of any special compensation expenses and one time charges decreased from million or of revenues in fiscal to  or of revenues in fiscal operating income decreased in when compared to as a result of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenues  partially offset by growth in revenue

as a result of this analysis  the company recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facilities 
these funds  combined with borrowings under capitalized lease obligations  have provided the liquidity to finance the growth of the company 
on september  the company completed the initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used approximately million of these proceeds to repay all bank indebtedness  redeem outstanding series b preferred stock and pay the special bonuses 
the remaining million has been and will continue to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
upon completion of the company s initial public offering  the company issued  shares of the common stock to the founders in exchange for series a preferred stock and the founders note 
on march   the company entered into a new million line of credit facility the credit line with pnc bank the bank 
the credit line replaces the company s former term loan and credit facility originated in conjunction with the recapitalization 
the credit line expired on april   but was extended by the bank to april  outstanding balances bear interest at the company s option at either the libor rate plus basis points or at the bank s prime rate minus fifty basis points 
the credit line is secured by all of the assets of the company and contains financial covenants and certain restrictions on the company ability to incur additional debt or dispose of its assets 
as of september   the company had no draws outstanding on the credit line 
this credit line compares favorably with a former term loan and credit facility which bore interest at either the libor rate plus to basis points or the prime rate plus to basis points and required an annual fee of  and an annual commitment fee of one half of on the average unused portion of such term loan and credit facility 
although total borrowing capability is million under the company s credit line versus million under its former term loan and credit facility  the company believes that the existing line will be sufficient to finance its current operations at least through the end of fiscal under a separate agreement dated february   with pnc leasing corporation  the company has up to million available for purposes of leasing call center equipment

as of september   the company has financed million of equipment purchases under this facility 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately  and million for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
the reduction in cash provided by operations was the result of the decrease in the company s net income in and a reduction in non cash income taxes offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the company s teleservices operations will continue to require significant capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capitalized leases  in applicable periods  were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the enhancement of technology used throughout its call center operations and additional call center expansion 
however  in conjunction with such expenditures  the company is evaluating whether to lease or buy such assets and may decide to enter into operating leases for their acquisition

while the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its growing revenues  the company s business tends to be slower in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year due to a certain segment of its workforce turning over coupled with a slowdown in client marketing programs during the summer months

year readiness disclosure the year problem arises as a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software  including those with embedded microprocessors  may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system and equipment failures or malfunctions causing disruptions of operations  including among others  a temporary inability to process calls  transactions and information  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s internal systems 
the company has evaluated its infrastructure as it relates to information technology and has developed a plan to ensure its year compliance 
this plan includes  among other things  replacing certain systems with new internally developed year compliant systems  upgrading the remaining software systems to be year compliant 
year compliant upgrades to the company s predictive dialing equipment are approximately complete with full completion planned by february these processes will allow the company to receive lead information  make and receive calls  and produce reports on compliant and non compliant date formats 
modification and testing of all information and noninformation systems are scheduled to be completed by march in addition  the company will also be replacing non compliant personal computer workstations by february the company is also in the process of evaluating its security systems  copiers and other noninformation technology infrastructure in which non compliant software or embedded microprocessors might exist 
the company believes that all material components in this infrastructure will be year compliant by the end of fiscal readiness of third parties 
the company has requested information from its third party vendors and clients on their year readiness to determine the extent to which their inability to be year compliant will affect the company 
this process has included identifying vendors and defining the readiness of their products and services 
the company s primary focus as it relates to vendors is on those that support the teleservices platform and information technology platforms  followed by all others 
the company is approximately through the vendor compliance documentation process which includes use of vendor compliance documentation published on the internet 
a similar process will be followed with clients to assess their year readiness 
the company s software is being modified to accept two digit year or four digit century inputs  and will output in either format 
accordingly  the company is prepared for either occurrence and should not be adversely affected by year format 
cost of year compliance 
the company has incurred minimal costs to date in addressing the year issue 
the year evaluation  modification and testing that has been undertaken to date has not had a material effect on the company s ability to deliver reports and other output on a timely basis 
however  the company anticipates that the year project could affect development of internal systems nearing the latter part of fiscal the company currently expects that the total costs to become year compliant will not exceed  hardware costs are projected to be approximately  software costs are projected to be approximately  and consulting and testing costs are projected to be approximately  the company is researching the use of a third party to independently review its plan and processes 
new capital equipment which the company will require will be either purchased or financed under the company s operating lease line 
the remaining costs will be financed out of operating working capital 
risks associated with the year the extent of the company s year exposure  the costs of achieving year compliance and the time period within which the company believes it will achieve its year compliance are based on management s knowledge to date and its best estimates 
the company is not aware  at this time  of any internal or third party vendor year non compliance that will not be fixed by the year and that will materially affect the company 
however  these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions  and some risks that the company faces include the failure of internal information systems  the failure of third parties to provide services  such as electricity and telecommunication services and a slow down in clients ability to make payments 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel  the ability to identify and correct all year impacted areas  the ability of third party vendors and clients to be year compliant and other similar uncertainties 
contingency plans 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  other than the loss of telecommunications and power  is loss of the dialers which will prevent the company from generating revenue 
it is reasonable to assume that there might be some interruptions related to specific campaigns and applications 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans 
such plans are expected to be completed by july item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk
