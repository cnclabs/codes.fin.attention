the company s risk management workers compensation program provides its clients with access to safety programs through the company s experienced safety professionals  early return to work programs and access to managed care networks for workers compensation services as part of the peo package 
the company also offers its fully insured  first dollar coverage workers compensation insurance program on a stand alone basis 
under the company s new guaranteed cost arrangements  the company expects that recent reductions in its stand alone workers compensation insurance program will continue 
many aspects of the company s risk management workers compensation program were developed prior to  during a period when the company partially self insured for certain workers compensation risks 
the company believes many of these structures and programs will continue to assist the company in managing workers compensation premium expense 
benefits programs the company believes it generally can obtain employee benefits  negotiate annual plan arrangements  and administer the plans and related claims at rates generally not available to small and medium sized firms depending upon geographic location  plan design and census demographics of the group 
the company s benefits programs include i major medical indemnity  preferred provider and health maintenance organization plans  ii group term life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance  iii dental indemnity and preferred provider insurance  iv vision care discount programs  v long term disability insurance  and vi short term disability and other supplemental insurance programs

the company has negotiated competitive premium rates by geographic regions with all of its third party health care insurers that are generally effective through december   at which time renewal provisions would apply 
worksite employee services the company also provides benefits and services directly to its worksite employees 
the company provides national and regional bank affiliations to expedite payroll check cashing and direct deposit services  and also offers credit union access to employees 
the company also provides discount passes for a variety of recreational  entertainment  social and cultural items across the united states  and for certain types of services 
the company has introduced a payroll deduction program under which the company currently offers to worksite employees the ability to purchase pre paid telephone cards and specialized insurance at competitive prices 
the company intends to offer in the future other goods and services such as homeowners  automobile and other types of personal insurance and travel services 
sales and marketing although the peo industry has grown significantly since its inception  it has not yet achieved widespread customer familiarity in many markets 
as a result  the company generally must first explain to potential clients what a peo does and the benefits a peo generally offers before the company can sell its particular services to the potential client 
the company therefore believes that its services can best be sold by experienced sales agents at individual  face to face meetings with potential clients 
the company has developed an internal sales and marketing capacity  and has entered into several strategic marketing alliances to promote the company s services 
sales the company has recently adopted a consolidated  centralized sales management structure  located at its phoenix headquarters 
in implementing this operational restructure  the company has recruited additional management  and hired key sales training and administrative personnel as part of an ongoing process to increase internal sales 
the company s national telemarketing operations generate new leads  which are supported by a nationwide network of sales representatives 
headquarters sales management provides continuous training and sales support to all company sales agents  assists them in new client pricing  and manages new case flow between the field and company corporate offices in phoenix 
the company s field sales operations are coordinated by regional vice presidents of sales rvps located in various cities 
these rvps manage a network of full time sales agents and part time sales brokers 
in certain circumstances  the company appoints general agents who supervise several sales agents whom report to an rvp 
to assure a significant nationwide selling presence  the company believes it is appropriate to maintain a large sales force 
at december   the company s sales force included rvps  general agents and sales agents 
the rvps  general agents and sales agents currently are compensated primarily via commissions  subject to certain vesting and production requirements 
the rvps and general agents also receive an override commission on sales generated by sales agents which report to them 
each rvp  general agent and sales agent is responsible for his or her own operating expenses such as rent  hiring outside salespersons  permanent staff salaries  telephone  travel  entertainment  training and other expenses  although the company defrays a portion of such expenses for the rvps 
commissions may be payable after termination in certain circumstances 
the company recently began executing its plan to place employee salespersons in key markets 
employee salespersons will be compensated through a combination of base salary and commissions  and will be eligible for participation in the company s stock option programs 
the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation services generally have been placed through esi risk management agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company rma 
the company established rma as its professional brokerage division to act as the company s conduit for its marketing alliance relationships with insurance wholesalers 
independent agencies and sales representatives receive compensation from rma based on production 
marketing the company s marketing operations provide comprehensive marketing support for all of the company s operations 
this support focuses on communications strategies  market research and analysis  product development and strategic alliances 
the marketing department also provides empirical data for salespersons to assist in prospecting activities in targeted industries and regions 
the marketing department has developed a communications strategy to provide continuity and consistency of the company s message 
this strategy also seeks to expand the company s contacts through new relationships and expand relationships with current clients 
marketing alliances the company has entered into several strategic alliances which it believes may enhance the marketing of its products and services by leveraging from the experience  industry expertise  geographical reach and customer contacts of such alliances 
these alliances may provide the company with profitable business opportunities to either expand its customer base or expand the services and products which the company may offer 
the company s current alliances include cross selling arrangements  arrangements to offer prepaid telephone cards and specialty insurance products to worksite employees  benefits education for worksite employees  and a nationwide check cashing program for worksite employees 
competition the market for many of the services provided by the company is highly fragmented with over  peos currently competing in the united states 
many of these peos have limited operations and relatively few worksite employees  but the company believes that several are larger than or comparable to the company in size 
as the peo concept becomes better known and achieves greater market penetration  the company expects the peo market to become substantially more competitive 
in areas of the country where peos have achieved greater market recognition and penetration  competition has become intense 
while price is the principal competitive factor  service and the coverage and quality of benefits programs are important ancillary competitive considerations 
the company s subscriber agreements with its clients generally may be canceled upon days written notice of termination by either party 
the short term nature of most customer agreements means that a substantial portion of the company s business could be terminated upon short notice 
the company believes that currently its greatest competition is with the traditional model in which clients provide employment related services in house together with the use of independent insurance brokers 
further  certain large insurance companies have become more aggressive in workers compensation and have reduced pricing in order to obtain market share  and price competition from state workers compensation insurance funds has intensified in certain markets 
the company also incurs direct competition from numerous peos  some of which have greater resources  greater assets and larger marketing staffs than the company 
the company also competes with payroll processing firms  temporary personnel companies and human resource consulting firms 
in addition  the company expects that as the peo industry becomes better established  competition will increase because existing peo firms will likely consolidate into fewer and better competitors and well organized new entrants with greater resources than the company  including some of the non peo companies described above  will enter the peo market 
information systems the company utilizes integrated payroll processing  billing and benefits management information and processing systems 
the company also has recently converted an advanced management system which allows for real time reporting of worksite accidents and injuries and assists the company in executing its risk management program 
effective january  the company has completed the transition of all peo processing to a unified software platform and a centralized client server at its phoenix headquarters  and expects to complete the installation of a new company wide accounting software package in april while the company expects improved performance from these developments  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or other difficulties as new systems are implemented  which may materially adversely affect its performance 
see also item management s discussion and analysis outlook issues and risks  year compliance herein 
the company has acquired various products installed at certain peo client locations to facilitate the transmission of payroll related data 
these include a pc based software product  electronic time clocks and direct dial in modems 
investment policy the basic objectives of the company s investment policy are the safety and preservation of the invested funds  the liquidity of investments to meet cash flow requirements including future claims payments and related requirements for its risk management workers compensation program  and the realization of a maximum rate of return on investments consistent with capital preservation 
the investment policy defines eligible investments  investment limits and investment maturities as guidelines to meet the policy s objectives 
the company has appointed outside investment managers to assist in portfolio management 
the company invests its available funds primarily in commercial paper  us government and agency securities rated a p or better and other short term liquid investments 
risk management workers compensation program recent developments the company recently changed its business strategy with respect to its workers compensation program in response to the changing profile of  and greater risks associated with  its worksite employee base  increased competition and reduced margin opportunities  and in an effort to reduce the uncertainty associated with its quarterly workers compensation expense 
as part of the company s change in business strategy  the company obtained fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation coverage effective january   thereby eliminating  with limited exceptions  the company s risk retention on workers compensation claims arising after that date 
the coverage was obtained through stirling cooke risk management services  inc under a three year arrangement  with pricing subject to annual review 
the company will retain risk up to  per occurrence with respect to a defined portfolio of stand alone policies which were in place at december   which policies expire at various dates during the company also will retain risk up to  per occurrence for claims under ohio s monopolistic workers compensation structure  with an aggregate liability limitation based on a percentage of ohio manual premium 
the company also is pursuing aggressively a loss portfolio transfer or similar reinsurance  for pre claims 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete such a transaction  or of the terms on which such a transaction could be completed 
because many of the company s programs and structures will remain in effect as a means of managing risks in the future  and because they may continue to be utilized by the company in managing its pre claims  a description of the company s pre partially self insured program is included below 
background workers compensation is a statutory system which requires employers to purchase insurance or to self insure in order to provide their employees with medical care and other specified benefits for work related injuries or illnesses 
compensation is payable regardless of who is at fault and the workers compensation policy generally is the employee s sole source of recovery 
four types of benefits typically are payable under workers compensation policies medical benefits  indemnity payments for lost wages  payments for job retraining and payments for permanent disabilities or death 
the amounts of disability and death benefits payable for claims are established by statute  but no dollar limitation is set forth for medical benefits 
regulations governing workers compensation vary by state 
as the employer of record for its worksite employees  the company is required to provide workers compensation insurance to its leased employees unless other arrangements are made by the client 
in june the company began providing workers compensation insurance through camelback insurance  ltd 
camelback  its wholly owned insurance company chartered in bermuda  in coordination with its servicing insurers primarily reliance national indemnity company reliance which provided full first dollar insurance coverage for workers compensation losses 
camelback reinsured the servicing insurers obligation for losses up to   for certain transportation programs and  in two states with monopolistic workers compensation insurance structures for each occurrence 
the servicing insurer arrangements are subject to certain standard exceptions and exclude coverage of certain high risk employees  the company typically does not accept clients with those types of employees although exceptions may exist 
to further reduce its potential liability  the company secured accidental death and dismemberment insurance that covers losses of up to  increased from  in july to obtain a net reduction in excess reinsurance costs for certain types of serious claims and maintains umbrella coverage for certain liabilities other than losses resulting from workers compensation claims the company may incur in connection with its administration of its risk management workers compensation program 
the company terminated its accidental death and dismemberment policy effective february  in conjunction with the transition to a guaranteed cost environment 
the company has utilized its selective evaluation process  safety programs and active claims management to manage its loss experience 
while the company has entered into a guaranteed cost  fully insured program effective january   the company remains subject to liabilities for losses and claims arising prior to that time  and there may exist further liability for claims which have not yet been reported 
changes in workers compensation experience could affect the company s future costs 
factors such as weakened underwriting standards as a result of internal growth  loss experience of recently acquired operations  changes in the risk profile of the company s worksite employee base  or increased competition could affect workers compensation experience  and an increase in the company s loss experience could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  business and financial performance 
see item management s discussion and analysis outlook issues and risks  adequacy of loss reserves  loss and claims experience herein 
underwriting the company works to control the company s exposure to losses by ensuring that prospective clients present acceptable risks 
the company reviews most prospective clients prior loss experience and safety record  the extent to which such losses can be prevented  job and industry classifications and current workers compensation premium rates 
the company s nationwide presence permits it to select those industries and clients that present risk profiles that it believes it can manage effectively 
the company carefully scrutinizes each prospective client s risk profile 
many prospective clients submitted to the company are rejected and do not become clients of the company 
once a prospect is accepted  the company periodically reviews the client s claims experience and costs to determine whether fee adjustments or other changes are needed 
the company generally may terminate its relationship with peo clients on days notice  and thereby quickly reduce any unacceptable exposure to workers compensation claims 
safety control the company provides continuing assistance to its clients in developing and maintaining safety programs and procedures 
the company reviews periodic loss reports  attempts to identify weaknesses in the client company s loss control procedures and assists the client in correcting those weaknesses 
the company can mandate that its peo clients implement recommended safety procedures as a condition to receiving peo services or workers compensation coverage 
claims management the company seeks through active claims management to resolve claims quickly and at the lowest possible cost 
the company emphasizes prompt attention to injuries and claims  striving to achieve immediate reporting of injuries and with a goal of contacting the employee  the client employer and the treating physician within hours of the time an injury is reported 
the company follows up with an injured employee on a regular basis  and emphasizes return to work programs to minimize lost productivity 
the company makes available managed care programs to treat employees and audits medical bills 
the company and the third party claims administrator tpa work together to administer each claim  maintaining contacts with the claimant employees  medical providers and client companies  investigating claims reports and controlling medical  rehabilitation and other claims settlement costs 
in addition  the tpa cannot settle any claim without the company s prior approval 
the company believes its proactive claims management approach permits it to close its claims  on average  more quickly than ordinary workers compensation insurers 
stand alone workers compensation the company has provided its workers compensation program to non peo customers on a stand alone basis 
the stand alone program primarily was intended to provide an opportunity to establish relationships with companies which were not currently seeking peo services but were believed to be candidates for future conversion into a comprehensive peo relationship  and further was intended to permit the company to leverage its workers compensation expertise 
the company does not intend to actively market its stand alone program in because it has determined to emphasize other peo marketing strategies and because of the decreased profit opportunities resulting from increased price competition in the overall workers compensation market 
the decision also is based on the terms of the company s guaranteed cost program  which limit the company s profit potential on stand alone cases written after january  to commission income 
medical programs in addition to its medical insurance plans which are fully insured by several third party providers  the company offers a self insured program through an arrangement with provident life accident company provident 
two prior partially self insured arrangements were terminated on december   and the administrators of those arrangements are presently handling claim run off in accordance with the applicable programs 
as of december   approximately employees were insured under the provident program 
under the provident program  the maximum policy coverage is  per covered individual per year  for which the company is responsible 
working with provident  the company seeks to limit its risk by performing a review of loss factors  and carefully monitoring claims experience 
the company establishes reserves for anticipated liabilities  however  there can be no assurance that the reserves will be adequate due to such factors as unanticipated loss development on known claims  increases in the number and severeity of new claims  and a lack of historical claims experience with new clients 
in june  the company entered into a strategic relationship with aetna us healthcare  and the company now offers aetna s high quality  competitively priced medical and dental plans to the company s full time corporate and worksite employees in areas of the country where aetna maintains preferred provider networks 
the company believes that the value and comprehensiveness of aetna s health benefit plans will allow the company to consolidate and simplify its benefit plan offerings  improve service and reduce costs 
the company has negotiated competitive premium rates by geographic regions with all of its third party health care insurers that are generally effective through december   at which time renewal provisions would apply 
employees at december   the company employed full time corporate employees in addition to the worksite employees 
the company considers its employee relations to be very good 
industry regulation federal regulation employers in general are regulated by numerous federal laws relating to labor  tax and employment matters 
generally  these laws prohibit race  age  sex  disability and religious discrimination  mandate safety regulations in the workplace  set minimum wage rates and regulate employee benefits 
because many of these laws were enacted prior to the development of non traditional employment relationships  such as peo services  many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non traditional employers 
as a result  interpretive issues concerning the definition of the term employer in various federal laws have arisen pertaining to the employment relationship 
unfavorable resolution of these issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
compliance with these laws and regulations is time consuming and expensive 
the company s standard forms of agreement provide that the client is responsible for compliance with certain employment related laws and regulations  and that the client is obligated to indemnify the company against breaches of the agreement 
however  some legal uncertainty exists with respect to the potential scope of the company s liability in the event of violations by its clients of employment  discrimination and other laws 
taxes as employer of record for its clients employees  the company assumes responsibility for the payment of federal and state employment taxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to its worksite employees 
there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations income tax withholding requirements  social security obligations under the federal income contribution act fica and unemployment obligations under the federal unemployment tax act futa 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  the employer has the obligation to remit the employer portion and  where applicable  withhold and remit the employee portion of these taxes 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay state unemployment taxes and withhold state income taxes 
the internal revenue service irs has formed a market segment study group to examine whether peos such as the company are for certain employee benefit and tax purposes the employers of worksite employees under the code 
if the irs were to determine that the company is not an employer under certain provisions of the code  it could materially adversely affect the company in several ways 
with respect to benefit plans  the tax qualified status of the company s k plans could be revoked  and the company s cafeteria and medical reimbursement plans may lose their favorable tax status resulting in employer liability  including penalties for failure to withhold applicable taxes in connection with the cafeteria and medical reimbursement plans 
the company cannot predict either the timing or the nature of any final decision that may be reached by the irs with respect to the market segment study group or the ultimate outcome of any such decision  nor can the company predict whether the treasury department will issue a policy statement with respect to its position on these issues or  if issued  whether such statement would be favorable or unfavorable to the company 
effective as of january   the company has implemented a new k retirement plan which involves both the client and the company as co sponsors of the plan and is intended to be a multiple employer plan under code section c 
the company believes that this multiple employer plan is less likely to be adversely affected by any irs determination that no employer relationship exists between the company and worksite employees 
while the company does sponsor some sole employer plans covering worksite employees which the company assumed in connection with other acquired peo operations and which could be adversely affected by any unfavorable irs determination  the company intends to convert the majority of the sole employer plans into one or more multiple employer plans  and the company believes that any unfavorable irs determination  if applied prospectively that is  applicable only to periods after such a determination is reached  probably would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  if an adverse irs determination were applied retroactively to disqualify benefit plans  employees vested account balances under k plans would become taxable  an administrative employer such as the company would lose its tax deductions to the extent its matching contributions were not vested  a k plan s trust could become a taxable trust and the administrative employer could be subject to liability with respect to its failure to withhold applicable taxes and with respect to certain contributions and trust earnings 
in such event  the company also would face the risk of client dissatisfaction and potential claims by clients or worksite employees 
a determination by the irs that the company is not an employer under certain provisions of the code also could lead the irs to conclude that federal taxes were not paid by the proper party  because such taxes must be paid by the employer 
this conclusion could lead to actions by the irs against clients of the company seeking direct payment of taxes  plus penalties and interest  even though the taxes were previously paid by the company 
further  if the company were required to report and pay such taxes on account of its clients  rather than on its own account as the employer  the company could incur increased administrative burdens and costs 
in light of the irs market segment study group and the general uncertainty in this area  certain legislation has been drafted to clarify the employer status of peos in the context of the code and benefit plans 
however  there can be no assurance that such legislation will be proposed and adopted and even if it were adopted  the company may need to change aspects of its operations or programs to comply with any requirements which may ultimately be adopted 
in particular  the company may need to retain increased sole or shared control over worksite employees if the legislation is passed in its current form 
in addition to the employer employee relationship requirement described above  pension and profit sharing plans including the company s k plans must satisfy certain other requirements under the code 
these other requirements are generally designed to prevent discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees to the detriment of non highly compensated employees with respect to both the availability of and the benefits rights and features offered in qualified employee benefit plans 
the company has made a good faith attempt to apply the non discrimination requirements of the code in an effort to maintain its k plans in compliance with the requirements of the code 
employee pension welfare benefit plans are also governed by erisa 
erisa defines an employer as any person acting directly as an employer  or indirectly in the interest of an employer  in relation to an employee benefit plan 
erisa defines the term employee as any individual employed by an employer 
the united states supreme court has held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under erisa 
a definitive judicial interpretation of an employer in the context of a full service peo arrangement has not been established 
if the company were found not to be an employer for erisa purposes  its plans would not comply with erisa and the level of services the company could offer may be materially adversely affected 
further  as a result of such finding  the company and its plans would not enjoy the pre emption of state laws provided by erisa and could be subject to varying state laws and regulations as well as to claims based upon state common law 
while the department of labor has issued advisory opinions to one or more staff leasing companies indicating that their welfare plans  which cover worksite employees  are multiple employer welfare arrangements rather than single employer plans  the company has not been the subject of any such advisory opinion 
if  however  the company s welfare benefit plans were found to be multiple employer welfare arrangements  erisa would not pre empt the application of certain state insurance laws to the plans 
certain company clients maintain their own retirement and or welfare benefit plans covering worksite employees 
the company s involvement in these plans is limited to forwarding payroll amounts to the client as directed by the client to fund such plans and the company has assumed no obligation in connection with the sponsorship or administration of such plans 
while the company believes that it has no liability in connection with any of these client plans  due to the legal uncertainty that exists in this area  the company cannot guarantee that such is the case 
workers compensation camelback is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of bermuda 
such laws and regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders  as opposed to the interests of shareholders such as the company 
such laws and regulations  among other things  relate to capital and surplus levels  levels of dividends payable by subsidiaries to their parent companies  financial disclosure  reserve requirements  investment parameters and premium rates 
in general  the regulatory authorities have broad administrative authority over insurers domiciled in their jurisdictions 
among other requirements and limitations  bermuda law requires that camelback must maintain statutory capital and surplus based primarily on premium volume 
the company is subject to additional requirements pursuant to its arrangements with reliance 
see item management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources 
the laws of bermuda also place certain limitations upon the transfer of statutory capital and surplus from an insurer to its parent company whether via dividend or otherwise  and regulate the circumstances under which an insurer is permitted to loan funds to its parent company 
from june through december the company s risk management workers compensation services program primarily was conducted via fronting arrangements with insurers  under which another insurer issues a policy on behalf of camelback 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic recently adopted a model act concerning fronting arrangements 
the model act requires reporting and prior approval of reinsurance transactions relating to these arrangements  and limits the amount of premiums that can be written under certain circumstances 
no determination can be made as to whether  or in what form  such act may ultimately be adopted by any state and  the company is therefore unable to predict whether the model act will affect its relationships with its insurers in the future should it wish to resume its self insured program 
state regulation requires licensing of persons soliciting the sale of workers compensation insurance within that state 
in certain states  licenses are obtained by individual agents rather than a corporate entity 
the company  or one of its employees  is licensed in most states 
although the company does not believe that its activities require such licenses because it solicits through other licensed entities  it is a risk that the company may be deemed to be making sales without a license in jurisdictions where it is not licensed  or that it would cease to maintain necessary licenses upon the departure of the employee who holds certain of such licenses 
health care reform various proposals for national health care reform have been under discussion in recent years  including proposals to extend mandatory health insurance benefits to virtually all classes of employees 
any health care reform proposal which mandated health insurance benefits based on the number of employees employed by an entity could adversely affect peos such as the company  which for some purposes are deemed to employ all their clients employees 
in addition  certain reform proposals have sought to include medical costs for workers compensation in the reform package 
if such proposals increased the cost of medical payments or limited the company s ability to control its workers compensation costs  the company s ability to offer competitively priced workers compensation coverage to its clients could be adversely affected 
while the company is unable to predict whether or in what form health care reform will be enacted  aspects of such reform  if enacted  may have an adverse effect upon the company s medical and workers compensation insurance programs 
state and local regulation the company is subject to regulation by local and state agencies pertaining to a wide variety of labor related laws 
as is the case with federal regulations discussed above  many of these regulations were developed prior to the emergence of the peo industry and do not specifically address non traditional employers 
while many states do not explicitly regulate peos  eighteen states have passed laws that have licensing or registration requirements and several others are considering such regulation 
further  a number of other states have passed laws defining peos for purposes of addressing  in particular contexts  whether peos constitute employers under certain state laws applicable to employers generally 
the company believes it is licensed where required 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos 
some states also specify contractual arrangements between the peo and the client company  and the peo and the worksite employee 
for example  some states require an employment relationship under which the company must retain sole or shared control over worksite employees  thereby requiring the company to bear more responsibility than under its standard co employer model 
because existing regulations are relatively new  there is limited interpretive or enforcement advice available 
the development of additional regulations and interpretation of existing regulations can be expected to evolve over time 
the company has formed camelback in part to avail itself of the favorable tax treatment of insurance companies  which pay state premium taxes rather than income taxes and which may tax deduct reserves when booked 
although the company believes that it has structured its camelback arrangements to qualify for such tax treatment  any disallowance of this tax treatment could materially affect the company s results of operations 
item properties the company leases all of its offices 
the company s headquarters office space at north th street  phoenix  arizona is leased for a term expiring in the lease took effect on april   and increased the useable space for the company s home office operations from approximately  square feet to  square feet  allowing the company to consolidate various phoenix operations and maintain space for expansion 
the company also leases smaller amounts of office space at various locations in a number of other cities for its sales and operations offices 
the company believes that these facilities are adequate for its existing operations  although further acquisitions or expansion could increase its office space needs 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged to secure the company s revolving bank line of credit 
item legal proceedings securities class actions as previously reported  the company and certain of its present and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in ten actions filed between march and may while the exact claims and allegations vary  they all allege violations by the company of section b of the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder  with respect to the accuracy of statements regarding company reserves and other disclosures made by the company and certain directors and officers 
these suits were filed after a significant drop in the trading price of the company s common stock in march each of the actions seeks certification of a class consisting of purchasers of securities of the company over specified periods of time 
each of the complaints seeks the award of compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial  including interest thereon  and costs of the action  including attorneys fees 
the suits have been consolidated before a single judge of the us district court in phoenix  arizona 
the court has appointed lead plaintiffs for the putative class  approved plaintiffs selection of counsel  and ordered plaintiffs to file a consolidated  amended complaint on or about april  the company believes the actions are without merit and intends to defend the cases vigorously 
however  the ultimate resolution of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
other there are many legal uncertainties about employee relationships created by peos  such as the extent of the peo s liability for violations of employment and discrimination laws 
the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws even if it does not participate in such violations 
the company s standard form of client service agreement establish the contractual division of responsibilities between the company and its clients for various personnel management matters  including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations 
however  because the company acts as a co employer  and in some instances acts as sole employer  the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws despite these contractual provisions and even if it does not participate in such violations 
the circumstances in which the company acts as sole employer may expose the company to increased risk of such liabilities for an employees actions 
the company has been sued in actions alleging responsibility for employee actions which it considers to be incidental to its business 
although it believes it has meritorious defenses  and maintains insurance and requires its clients to maintain insurance covering certain of such liabilities  there can be no assurances that the company will not be found to be liable for damages in any such suit  or that such liability would not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
although the client generally is required to indemnify the company for any liability attributable to the conduct of the client  the company may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities 
in addition  employees of the client may be deemed to be agents of the company  subjecting the company to liability for the actions of such employees 
the company was named as a defendant in an action filed by ladenburg thalmann co  inc in the united states district court  southern district of new york  no 
civ tpg  in may alleging breach of contract under certain stock warrants 
the plaintiff seeks damages of at least million 
the company believes the action is without merit and intends to defend the case vigorously

except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this form k contains or may contain forward looking statements which include statements in the future tense  statements using the terms believe  anticipate  expect  intend or similar terms and the discussions under outlook that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein particularly in outlook issues and risks below  and in item business  as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein or in any document incorporated herein by reference 
results of operations overview the following is a summary of certain factors which affect results of operations and which have generally applied to the company in all periods presented 
revenues the most significant components of the company s revenues are payments received from customers for gross salaries and wages paid to peo worksite employees and the company s service fee 
the company negotiates service fees on a client by client basis based on factors such as market conditions  client needs and services requested  the clients workers compensation and benefit plan experience  company administrative resources required  expected profit  and other factors 
these are generally expressed as a fixed percentage of the client s gross salaries and wages except for certain costs  primarily employer s health care contributions  which are billed to clients on an add on basis 
because the service fees are negotiated separately with each client and vary according to circumstances  the company s service fees  and therefore its gross margin  will fluctuate based on the company s client mix 
revenues from stand alone risk management workers compensation services consist primarily of gross premiums charged to clients for such services 
costs of revenues the company s direct costs of revenues include salaries and wages paid to worksite employees  employment related taxes  costs of health and welfare benefit plans  and workers compensation insurance costs 
the largest component of direct costs is salaries and wages to worksite employees 
although this cost is generally directly passed through to clients  the company may be responsible for payment of these costs even if not reimbursed by its clients 
employment related taxes consist of the employer s portion of payroll taxes required under fica  which includes social security and medicare  and federal and state unemployment taxes 
the federal tax rates are defined by the appropriate federal regulations 
state unemployment rates are subject to change each year based on claims histories and vary from state to state 
prior to january   workers compensation costs  whether relating to peo worksite employees or the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation program  include the costs of claims up to the retention limits relating to the company s workers compensation program  administrative costs  premium taxes  and excess reinsurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance premiums 
the company retained workers compensation liabilities up to certain specified amounts under its pre workers compensation insurance agreements 
accrued workers compensation claims liability is based upon estimates of reported and unreported claims and the related claims and claims settlement expenses in an amount equal to the retained portion of the expected total incurred claim 
the company s accrued workers compensation reserves are primarily based on industry wide data  and to a lesser extent  the company s past claims experience up to the retained limits 
the liability recorded may be more or less than the actual amount of the claims when they are submitted and paid 
changes in the liability are charged or credited to operations as the estimates are revised 
administrative costs include fees paid to the company s insurers and costs of claims management by third party administrators 
premium taxes include taxes and related fees paid to various states based on premiums written 
premium for excess reinsurance and accidental death and dismemberment relate to premium payments to the company s insurers for the retention of risks above specified limits 
in periods from and after january   workers compensation liabilities are fully insured under a guaranteed cost policy  subject to limited exceptions described below 
accordingly  workers compensation expense would include premiums paid to the company s third party insurance carriers for workers compensation insurance 
workers compensation expense during also will include the cost of a defined portfolio of stand alone policies in place at december  which policies expire at various dates during and as to which the company retains liability of  per occurrence plus fees as described above  and costs under the company s self insurance program in ohio  with respect to which the company retains liability of  per occurrence with an aggregate liability limitation based on a percentage of the ohio manual premium 
health care and other employee benefits costs consist of medical and dental insurance premiums  payments of and reserves for claims subject to deductibles and the costs of vision care  disability  life insurance and other similar benefit plans 
the company s health care benefit plans consist of a mixture of fully insured programs and partially self insured programs with specific and  in one program  aggregate stop loss insurance 
the company recognizes a liability for partially self insured health insurance claims at the time a claim is reported to the company by the third party claims administrator  and also provides for claims incurred  but not reported based on industry wide data and the company s past claims experience 
the liability recorded may be more or less than the actual amount of ultimate claims 
while the company believes that its reserves for healthcare and workers compensation claims are adequate for future claims payments  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
see outlook issues and risks herein 
selling  general and administrative expenses the company s primary operating expenses are personnel expenses  other general and administrative expenses  and sales and marketing expenses 
personnel expenses include compensation  fringe benefits and other personnel expenses related to the company s internal employees 
other general and administrative expenses include rent  office supplies and expenses  legal and accounting fees  bad debt expenses  insurance and other operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include commissions to sales personnel and related expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consists primarily of the amortization of goodwill and acquisition costs from the company s prior acquisitions 
the company amortizes goodwill and acquisition costs over periods of three to thirty years  depending on the assets acquired  using the straight line method 
acquisitions generally result in considerable goodwill because peos generally require few fixed assets to conduct their operations 
acquisitions period to period comparisons are substantially affected by the company s recent substantial growth through acquisition of other companies providing peo services 
the company has accounted for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the results of such acquired companies are reflected in the company s financial statements prospectively from the date of acquisition 
in addition to increasing revenues  acquisition activity can affect gross profits and margins because the industry mix of the acquired companies may differ from that of the company 
further during the transition period after an acquisition the company may act to implement pricing changes where appropriate and to eliminate client relationships which do not meet the company s risk or profitability profiles 
acquisition activity historically has increased the company s workers compensation expense  primarily by accelerating the company s overall growth rate and accelerating its exposure in specific higher risk segments  such as transportation 
the company also seeks to eliminate certain general and administrative costs of acquired companies although such results may not be achieved 
company peo acquisitions which have affected recent periods have included the following hazar  inc and affiliates hazar in october  team services in june  leaseway personnel corporation and leaseway administrative personnel  inc collectively  leaseway in august  the mcclary trapp group of companies mcclary trapp in november  etic corporation d b a employers trust etic in february  cmgr inc and humasys  inc 
collectively  cmgr in february  and four related peo companies referred to as employee resources corporation collectively  erc in september in addition  in september  the company acquired phoenix capital management  inc pcm  a peo service provider 
operating results margin comparisons are affected by the relative mix of stand alone risk management workers compensation services  full peo services  team services services  and driver leasing services acquired in the leaseway acquisition lpc in any particular period 
certain employment related taxes are based on the cumulative earnings of individual employees up to a specified wage level 
therefore  these expenses tend to decline over the course of a year 
since the company s revenues for an individual client are generally earned and collected at a relatively constant rate throughout each year  payment of such unemployment tax obligations positively impacts on the company s working capital and results of operations as the year progresses 
also  fourth quarter revenues are typically increased by year end bonuses and distributions paid to worksite employees  historically resulting in little to no revenue growth from fourth to first quarter excluding acquisitions 
in addition  the company s first quarter revenues tend to be adversely affected by decreased activity by various of its transportation clients due to seasonal factors 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  percent in thousands change revenues   cost of revenues   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   interest income  interest expense   net loss income   revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
acquisitions  and the addition of us xpress  inc and affiliates us xpress as a peo client  primarily accounted for the increase in revenues between the periods 
growth was in part offset by factors such as attrition of clients and competitive pressures in the peo and workers compensation industries 
the number of worksite employees increased to approximately  covering approximately  client companies at december  from approximately  covering  client companies at december  revenues related to stand alone risk management workers compensation services were million for the year ended december  which included non recurring revenue of approximately million related to stand alone workers compensation premiums that were under billed for policies written in the previous year compared with revenues of million for the year ended december  the decline in stand alone revenues primarily is attributable to increased competition in the workers compensation market 
stand alone revenues in and include significant amounts from a former client with which disputes have arisen 
the company has initiated litigation against the former client seeking  among other remedies  collection of a receivable for unpaid premium of approximately million 
while the company believes that it will prevail in the litigation  there can be no assurance that this will be the case and an adverse outcome could result in the write off of all or a substantial portion of the receivable 
the company does not intend to actively market its stand alone program in because it has determined to emphasize other peo marketing strategies and because of the decreased profit opportunities resulting from increased price competition in the overall workers compensation market 
the decision also is based on the terms of the company s guaranteed cost program  which limit the company s profit potential on stand alone cases written after january  to commission revenue 
see liquidity and capital resources 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the company s business as previously described and as described below 
workers compensation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase primarily is due to the rapid growth in the company s overall business  as discussed above  accelerated by acquisition activity and the addition of us xpress  all of which have increased exposure in higher risk market segments such as transportation 
the increase is also due to an unexpected and significant increase in claims activity  particularly in the fourth quarter of  including loss development on prior period claims 
this increase led in turn to a significant increase in the company s workers compensation reserves as established via the independent actuarial review upon which the company s workers compensation reserves are based see discussion below 
in light of the unanticipated increased claims and reserve requirements  and taking into account prior unanticipated increases in actuarial reserve requirements in particular  an unanticipated increase taken at december   the company has implemented a change in its business strategy whereby the company seeks to minimize future uncertainty associated with its worker s compensation expense 
the change in strategy is based on competitive market conditions which provide an opportunity to obtain third party insurance at a favorable cost and which limit opportunities for the company to profit from risk retention and the changing profile of its worksite employee base 
consistent with this strategy  the company increased its workers compensation reserves at december  approximately million to establish its reserves at a level intended to eliminate any risk of future workers compensation loss development expense related to pre occurrences 
consistent with company policy  the company commissioned an independent third party actuarial review of the company s workers compensation reserves at year end  as it had in and the company s workers compensation reserves at december  are based on a review by that independent actuary  which was the same actuary that provided the report upon which the company s december  reserves were based 
the company consistently established its workers compensation reserves on a quarterly basis throughout based on reviews by that same independent actuary 
the actuary relied on industry standards  while taking into account the company s specific risk structure and philosophy  in determining its findings 
as part of the company s change in business strategy  the company obtained fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation coverage effective january   thereby eliminating the company s risk retention on workers compensation claims arising after that date except for costs associated with certain stand alone cases and ohio claims 
consistent with the change in business strategy  the company also is pursuing aggressively a loss portfolio transfer for pre claims although there can be no assurance that such a transaction can be completed on satisfactory terms 
the company believes that the transition to a guaranteed cost program and the increase in reserves at december  will reduce the uncertainty associated with quarterly workers compensation costs while providing a cost structure for which compares favorably with historical costs 
the company also believes that its workers compensation reserves have been established at a level which is consistent with its change in business strategy described above including expense associated with a loss portfolio transfer should such a transfer be completed  though there can be no assurance that this is the case 
see outlook issues and risks adequacy of loss reserves loss and claims experience 
the following table provides an analysis of the company s workers compensation reserves associated with its partially self insured programs for the periods presented 
effective july   and included in the reserve  is a provision for losses and payments for self insurance programs in ohio 
in thousands reserve beginning of period   losses    payments    reserve end of period    end of period worksite employees    stand alone employees    total employees    gross profit the company s gross profit margin decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to several factors including higher workers compensation costs  the impact of repricing existing clients due to competitive factors  and lower margins on new business 
the proportion of team services revenues  which have lower margins  increased during in addition  while a significant portion of the company s total revenue was derived from us xpress  as discussed previously  the gross profit on that revenue was negligible for the year ended december  the company generally has earned a higher gross profit margin on revenues derived from its stand alone risk management workers compensation services than on revenues derived from the company s full service peo business  as peo revenues generally include significant and substantially offsetting revenue and expense items for payroll and payroll related costs for the worksite employees 
stand alone revenues represented a significantly smaller percentage of revenues as compared to prior periods  thereby reducing margin 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million to million  or  from million for the year ended december  factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over are the inclusion of the operations of various acquisitions  an increase from corporate employees at december  to at december   the relocation of the company s office space to a larger facility to accommodate growth  increased bad debt expense and increased professional services fees due in part to litigation commenced against the company in early these factors which caused increases in selling  general and administrative expense were partially mitigated by improved systems utilization and economies of scale achieved within the company s operations 
the company s insurance costs have increased due primarily to the company s growth 
commission expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to the same periods in due to the increase in revenues discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase to meet the needs of new business  though the company has initiated efforts to improve efficiencies 
as discussed under outlook  below  the company anticipates that it will incur costs in connection with the expansion of its sales force and the addition of account executives during depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization represents depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of organizational costs  customer lists and goodwill 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to depreciation of communication and computer systems and goodwill amortization resulting from acquisitions  with leaseway and mcclary trapp in and etic and cmgr in being the most significant 
goodwill amortization of these acquisitions was recognized from the date of acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources below regarding the company s issuance of million in senior notes due  in particular as to the approximately million in offering expenses which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
interest interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased borrowings 
for the year ended december  interest income totaled million compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily due to interest earned on both the restricted cash and investments held for the future payment of workers compensation claims at the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary  camelback and cash held at the corporate level 
on october   the company issued million of notes in a private placement transaction 
the increase in borrowings pursuant to the notes as compared to prior borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be expected to increase interest expense in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate provides for federal  state and local income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a benefit of as compared to a provision of for the year ended december  the tax rate used in each quarterly reporting period generally was an estimate of the company s effective tax rate for the calendar year 
the company recognized a tax benefit in as a result of its loss 
the effective tax rate for and reflects the operations of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  camelback  which pays state premium tax rather than state income tax 
although the company believes that it has structured its camelback arrangements to qualify for such tax treatment  any disallowance of this tax treatment could materially affect the company s results of operations for the current fiscal year and future fiscal years 
the company s effective tax rate will vary from time to time depending primarily on the mix of profits derived from the company s various profit centers  the magnitude of nondeductible items relative to overall profitability and other factors 
the company s estimated effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes for is also based on estimates of the following items that are not deductible for tax purposes a amortization of certain goodwill  and b one half of the per diem allowance relating to meals paid to truck drivers under a company sponsored program 
additional factors which may impact the company s future operations and results are discussed below under outlook issues and risks 
outlook the company firmly established itself as one of the country s leading peos following rapid internal growth and the completion of numerous acquisitions from through beginning in late  the company began to experience the effects of increased competition and a general weakening in the workers compensation and employee benefits markets  which developments have reduced the company s operating margins 
these factors also have slowed the company s internally generated revenue growth  though overall revenues continued to increase rapidly during this period due to acquisitions and the addition of us xpress as a client 
due primarily to reduced internally generated growth  the absence of new acquisition activity and seasonal client turnover at year end  the total number of worksite employees has been relatively flat from october through february in view of these developments  the company has developed and is implementing specific action plans intended to leverage the company s extensive nationwide platform and core peo strengths and take advantage of the significant opportunities available in the rapidly growing peo marketplace 
the primary plans are summarized below 
as discussed above  in october  the company completed an million offering of its senior notes due this transaction has resulted in an enhanced financial foundation for the company  including cash and marketable securities of approximately million at december  in recent months  the company consolidated its sales management functions at its phoenix headquarters under new leadership 
programs have been initiated to spur internal sales growth by increasing the size of the company s sales force  including the addition of employee salespersons to the current base of independent sales agents  and by the planned entry into new markets via the acquisition of local peos or the establishment of new sales offices 
further  the company has initiated programs intended to improve client retention  including the addition of account executives at key locations throughout the country during with specific client service and retention responsibilties 
the company has taken specific steps to position itself to manage costs more effectively and improve overall operating efficiencies 
effective january  the company has completed the transition of all peo processing to a unified software platform and a centralized client server at its phoenix headquarters  which is expected to improve consistency and efficiency while simultaneously affording better local client service 
in april  the company expects to complete the installation of a new company wide accounting software package  which will improve significantly the quality and detail of information available to management while simultaneously speeding its delivery 
the company has also retained a team of independent consultants who are charged with developing detailed recommendations to improve the company s internal structures and processes at corporate headquarters and throughout the company s regional offices 
the company has consolidated certain facilities obtained via acquisitions 
the company expects to gain greater control over its workers compensation costs via the transition to fully insured  guaranteed cost coverage from third party insurers effective january  the company also is taking specific actions to focus its resources more tightly on its core peo competencies 
all existing programs are under careful review 
as a result of this review  the company already has determined to discontinue altogether writing new stand alone workers compensation cases effective may  primarily due to the desire to focus corporate resources on core peo activities  increased competition and the reduced profit potential on stand alone cases under the company s new guaranteed cost workers compensation arrangements 
the company has taken specific actions to improve the depth of its senior management team in light of recent rapid growth 
as noted above  sales management has been consolidated at the company s phoenix headquarters and significant additions have been made to the sales management team 
the company recently announced the addition of two independent directors to improve the quality of the strategic direction and assistance provided at the board level 
the company also has announced the retention of an executive search firm to identify candidates for the position of corporate president  and intends to retain an individual who will bring to the position proven operational skills and the highest possible leadership potential 
the company will continue to evaluate and act upon management needs 
the company also is pursuing diligently the transfer of pre workers compensation claims pursuant to a loss portfolio transfer or similar transaction 
the company believes that such a transaction can be accomplished without a charge to earnings in future periods based on the level of workers compensation reserves at december   and further believes that funds currently held as restricted cash will be sufficient to fund the transfer 
as discussed above  the company believes that it has identified and is implementing appropriate specific actions which  over time  will result in significant revenue and margin enhancement and overall operational improvement from the extensive national peo platform which has been successfully built in prior years 
however  the company also anticipates that many of these actions will require a period of time to implement properly  and further anticipates that the benefits of these actions will be realized incrementally over the course of and beyond 
in addition  certain costs will be incurred before results can be achieved or evaluated 
factors which could affect the company s intended results include delays in implementing sales force or systems improvements  increased competition  unfavorable regulatory developments  general market acceptance of the company s peo services  cancellation or renegotiation of contracts  failure to conclude a loss portfolio transfer or similar transaction  increases in the anticipated pricing or changes in the anticipated terms of a loss portfolio or similar transaction  failure to conclude acquisition transactions or successfully integrate completed acquisitions  fluctuations in margins  the financial condition of the company s clients  demand fluctuations  and other risks set forth herein 
the company therefore further cautions that there can be no assurance of the success of any or all of the specific actions described above 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  percent in thousands change revenues   cost of revenues   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization  interest income interest expense   net income   net income for the year ended december   was million  or 
per diluted share  reflecting significant growth from net income of million  or 
per diluted share 
revenues of million for the year ended december   were higher than the growth was the result of integration of several acquisitions  the growth in the company s risk management workers compensation program  direct peo sales and marketing efforts  and the efficient administration of existing business 
revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase in revenues was partially due to sales from the company s expanded peo sales force 
acquisitions accounted for a significant increase in revenues between the periods 
the number of worksite employees increased from approximately  at december   to approximately  at december  in  the company commenced placing risk management workers compensation services to clients which are not full service peo clients of the company 
as of december   the company provided risk management workers compensation services to approximately  workers as compared to  at december  revenues related to stand alone risk management workers compensation were million in compared with million for cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the company s business as explained in the section above and in increased workers compensation expense 
workers compensation expenses increased approximately to million in from million in  due primarily to the increase in earned premiums on the stand alone risk management workers compensation program and growth in the core peo business  including acquisitions 
see discussion of cost of revenues under results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for further information 
gross profit the company s gross profit margin increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this increase primarily was attributable to the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation program which was in place for the full year ended december   versus only eight months in the eight month period included approximately  hazar employees who were provided stand alone risk management workers compensation from may through september  when the hazar assets became included in the company s peo business upon the acquisition of certain hazar assets by the company 
the company also received the benefits of reduced administrative costs with camelback for the entire year ended december  as compared with the same period in which only included seven months of benefit because camelback was not operative until june the company also has increased the number of claims managers to at december  compared to at december  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percent of gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to during the year ended december  and  respectively 
factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over are the integration of the operations of various acquisitions including an increase from corporate employees at december  to at december   resulting in a significant increase in personnel costs  and the expansion of the company s office space 
additionally  the company s results for the year reflected six months of expenses for team services and five months of expense for leaseway  both recent acquisitions which historically have maintained a higher ratio of selling  general and administrative expense to gross profit than the company 
these factors which caused increases in selling  general and administrative expense were partially mitigated by improved systems utilization and economies of scale achieved within the company s operations  including consolidation of certain acquired companies administration 
the company s general liability insurance costs have increased due in part to the added corporate staff and increased costs for directors and officers liability insurance 
commission expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to due to the increase in revenues discussed above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization represented depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of organizational costs  customer lists and goodwill in the year ended december  and the increase was due primarily to depreciation of new phone and computer systems and goodwill amortization resulting from acquisitions  with hazar  leaseway  and mcclary trapp being the most significant 
interest interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily due to interest earned on both the restricted cash held for the future payment of workers compensation claims at camelback and cash held at the corporate level raised through the exercise of common stock purchase warrants and through operations 
interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to interest accrued on the company s revolving line of credit 
the line was first utilized in august and had an average outstanding balance of million for the five months ended december  see liquidity and capital resources 
effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate provides for federal  state and local income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is as compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was positively impacted by a state tax benefit in the amount of approximately  relating to the effective tax rate would have been approximately without this benefit 
this downward year to year revision reflects a reduction resulting from the increased operations of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  camelback  which pays state premium tax rather than state income tax 
liquidity and capital resources the company defines liquidity as the ability to mobilize cash to meet operating  capital and acquisition financing needs 
the company s primary source of cash in was from financing activities and operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million during compared to a use of million during  and cash provided of million during operating cash flows are derived from customers for full peo services rendered by the company and for stand alone risk management workers compensation services 
payments from peo customers typically are received on or within a few days of the date on which payroll checks are delivered to customers  and cover the cost of the payroll  payroll taxes  insurance  other benefit costs and the company s administration fee 
the acquisitions of team services  leaseway and mcclary trapp  and the company s stand alone program adversely affected the company s operating cash flows in as these operations extend credit terms generally from to days as is customary in their respective market segments 
stand alone risk management workers compensation services are billed in accordance with individual policies 
the company also extends credit terms for certain of its stand alone risk management workers compensation clients by billing less than the expected premium over the policy term  with the difference paid on a deferred basis after the end of a policy year 
if the company expands in these market segments or enters into new market segments  or extends credit terms to additional clients  its working capital requirements may increase 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the company expects to use certain of the net proceeds from the note offering see below to finance future acquisitions 
future acquisitions are expected to be a significant use of cash 
see outlook issues and risk management of rapid growth 
in addition  cash purchase price payments are due in the second quarter of for two acquisitions 
the amounts of the payments are based on the terms of the applicable purchase agreements and have not yet been determined 
for  and  capital expenditures were million  
million and 
million  respectively 
capital expenditures in consisted primarily of communications and computer equipment to enhance the company s ability to support the company s increased client base and the centralization of payroll processing 
in addition  in april  the company relocated its phoenix operations to a new facility 
the leaseholds and improvements will be financed by the landlord as a buildout allowance  and subsequently reflected in rental payments 
moving costs and office furniture represented cash outlays in the first and second quarters of of approximately million 
during  the company expects to continue to invest in additional computer and technological equipment 
although the company continuously reviews its capital expenditure needs  management expects that capital expenditures will continue  and may significantly exceed amounts spent in  in order to meet the needs of the company s base of worksite employees 
cash provided by financing activities was million for compared to million for and million for cash flows from financing activities during resulted primarily from the issuance of the notes offset by the repayment of existing long term debt 
at december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in high investment grade instruments with maturities of less than days 
certain amounts of restricted cash and investments see below may have maturities beyond days but are highly liquid 
the company generally maintains large cash balances to meet its daily payroll and payroll tax obligations 
the company is implementing a nationwide cash management program to minimize the requirement for cash on hand  though as the business continues to grow  cash requirements to meet daily obligations will increase 
the company is required through its fronting arrangements with reliance to maintain restricted cash and investments to secure the future payment of workers compensation losses arising under its pre program 
such restricted cash and investments have been calculated based on estimates of ultimate losses under its workers compensation program 
for this purpose  ultimate losses are actuarially determined by the fronting carriers utilizing industry wide data and regulatory requirements which may not reflect the company s historical or expected ultimate losses 
restricted cash and investments are classified as a current asset as the company settles and pays most workers compensation claims within one year from occurrence 
the company cannot access restricted cash and investments without the agreement of reliance 
at december   million was on deposit at camelback as restricted cash and investments  as compared to million at december  in the event the company effects a loss portfolio transfer  the company will be required to make a cash payment  which may but is not expected to exceed the amount of the restricted cash  to fund the transfer of liabilities to a third party 
at december  and  the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
under bermuda law  camelback must maintain statutory capital and surplus in an amount based primarily on premium volume 
bermuda law also regulates the circumstances under which camelback may loan funds to its parent company 
in  the company paid to reliance approximately million of which approximately million was ceded to the trust account at camelback for payment of claims and approximately million was ceded directly to camelback as unrestricted 
for the same period the company also paid to legion insurance company approximately million of which approximately million in loss funds is expected to be ceded to camelback upon the establishment of a separate trust account for the program 
in the future  these factors may limit the ability of camelback to transfer funds to its parent company whether via dividend or otherwise 
prior credit facility in august  the company established a revolving line of credit facility prior credit facility for acquisition financing  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the original credit facility was a three year million revolving line of credit 
the line was expanded to million in october and to million in february the prior credit facility provided for various borrowing rate options including borrowing rates based on a fixed spread of basis points over the prime rate or basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor  as adjusted upward to reflect applicable reserve requirements 
the company paid a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the line 
since the company obtained its prior credit facility in august  the million drawn under the line at october  had been used primarily for acquisition financing including million for the acquisition of leaseway  million for the acquisition of mcclary trapp  million for cmgr  
million for etic and approximately million to finance accounts receivable on such acquisitions 
the company repaid outstanding indebtedness under the prior credit facility with net proceeds of the sale of the notes and replaced it with the amended credit facility 
see amended credit facility below 
note offering on october   the company issued million of notes in an offering the offering effected under rule a of the securities act of as amended securities act 
approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering was used to repay certain indebtedness  and the remaining balance will be used for additional capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
interest under the notes is payable semi annually commencing april   and the notes are not callable until october subject to the terms of the note agreement 
the company incurred expenses related to the offering of approximately million and will amortize such costs over the life of the notes 
the company agreed to file under the securities act  a registration statement relating to an exchange offer for these notes 
if this registration was not declared effective prior to the th day after the issue date of october  which it was not  the interest rate can increase up to a maximum of per annum of the principal amount of such notes  increasing by every days 
the indenture under which the notes were issued includes certain restrictions on use of cash  and other expenditures  by the company including limitations on dividends and repurchases of company shares 
amended credit facility in connection with the offering  the company entered into an amended and restated credit facility the amended credit facility which provided for a revolving line of credit of million  including letters of credit drawn thereunder 
the amended credit facility includes various borrowing rate options including borrowing rates at the prime rate or basis points over london interbank offered rate libor 
the company will pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the line and letter of credit fees of to basis points per annum 
the amended credit facility will mature on august  the principal loan covenants in the amended credit facility are as follows current ratio of at least to  minimum net worth of at least million as of june   adjusted by of net income and other factors each and every fiscal year thereafter  senior debt to earnings before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined therein for the preceding four fiscal quarters of not more than to as of the end of each calendar year and maximum debt to ebitda as reduced by a portion of available cash of to the amended credit facility includes certain other customary covenants and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
as a result of performance  the company is not in compliance with certain financial covenants under the amended credit facility  and may not borrow under the amended credit facility unless it returns to compliance or is able to agree with the bank to the new covenants  as to which there can be no assurance 
because of the company s current cash status  the company does not believe that the current unavailability of the amended credit facility will materially affect its liquidity  although there can be no assurance this will remain the case if cash needs significantly increase in the future 
outlook issues and risks the following issues and risks  among others including those discussed elsewhere herein  should also be considered in evaluating the company s outlook 
management of rapid growth the company s success depends  in part  upon its ability to achieve growth and manage this growth effectively 
since its formation  the company has experienced rapid growth which has challenged the company s management  personnel  resources and systems 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue continued growth through its sales and marketing capabilities  acquisitions and marketing alliances 
although the company has expanded its management  personnel  resources and systems to manage future growth and to assimilate acquired operations  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth in the future or manage this growth effectively 
failure to do so could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
to accommodate growth  the company is centralizing certain operations  which may result in temporary disruptions in operations 
see also outlook  above 
the company has grown substantially in recent years through the acquisition of other peo and similar companies 
although the company has recently focused on further integrating prior acquisitions into the company s operations  a key component of the company s long term growth strategy is to continue to pursue selective attractive acquisition opportunities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find attractive acquisition candidates at reasonable prices or  if it does  that other potential acquirers will not compete successfully with the company for these candidates 
any significant increase in the number of companies competing with the company to acquire peos would likely increase the cost of acquisitions and thereby limit the company s ability to grow profitably through acquisitions 
in addition  although the company attempts to evaluate each acquisition candidate thoroughly prior to an acquisition  there can also be no assurance that  once acquired  the company will be able to achieve acceptable levels of revenues  profitability or productivity from the acquired company 
a portion of the company s historical growth is attributable to its risk management workers compensation services program 
the risks associated with rapid growth in this area include the potential for inadequate underwriting due to a lack of experience with new geographic markets and industries served  a shortage of experienced and trained personnel  and the need for sophisticated operating systems to help manage these risks 
the company recently converted its risk management information system to a new operating system to support this growth  there can be no assurance that this conversion will ultimately prove to be successful  or that other future changes in systems or procedures will be successfully completed 
any failure to manage growth in the risk management workers compensation program could adversely affect the company s ability to underwrite profitable risks and efficiently resolve claims  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
the pricing of the company s guaranteed cost and ohio reinsurance policies in place as of january  are subject to annual negotiation  and the above factors could materially increase the company s costs under such policies 
adequacy of loss reserves  loss and claims experience under its partially self insured workers compensation arrangements in effect until january   the company is responsible for the first   for certain transportation programs and  in two states with monopolistic workers compensation insurance structures of each occurrence with no aggregate limit to the number of losses for which the company may be liable 
the company s reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses under its workers compensation are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment expenses 
reserves are estimates based on industry data and historical experience  and include judgments of the effects that future economic and social forces are likely to have on the company s experience with the type of risk involved  circumstances surrounding individual claims and trends that may affect the probable number and nature of claims arising from losses not yet reported 
consequently  loss reserves are inherently uncertain and are subject to a number of circumstances that are highly variable and difficult to predict 
this uncertainty is compounded in the company s case by its rapid growth and limited experience 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that the company s ultimate liability will not materially exceed its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
if the company s reserves prove to be inadequate  the company will be required to increase reserves or corresponding loss payments with a corresponding reduction  which may be material  to the company s operating results in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
the company recently changed its business strategy with respect to its workers compensation program and related workers compensation reserves in response to the changing risk profile of its worksite employee base  increased competition and reduced margin opportunities  the availability of third party insurance at attractive rates  and in an effort to reduce the uncertainty associated with its quarterly workers compensation expense 
as part of the company s change in business strategy  the company obtained fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation coverage effective january   thereby eliminating  with limited exceptions  the company s risk retention on workers compensation claims arising after that date 
the coverage was obtained through stirling cooke risk management services  inc under a three year arrangement  with pricing subject to annual review 
the company will retain risk up to  per occurrence with respect to a defined portfolio of stand alone policies which were in place at december   which policies expire at various dates during the company also will retain risk up to  per occurrence for claims under ohio s monopolistic workers compensation structure  with an aggregate liability limitation based on a percentage of ohio manual premium 
consistent with the change in strategy  the company also increased its workers compensation reserves at december  to reflect a one time charge of approximately million to establish its reserves at a level intended to eliminate any risk of future workers compensation charges for pre claims 
the company also is pursuing aggressively a loss portfolio transfer or similar reinsurance  for pre claims 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete such a transaction  or of the terms on which such a transaction could be completed 
the company believes that the transition to a guaranteed cost program and the increase in reserves at december  will reduce the uncertainty associated with the quarterly calculation of workers compensation costs while providing a premium cost structure for which compares favorably with historical costs 
the availability of coverages and premium costs in future years are subject to change including possible material upward adjustment of premium costs based on loss experience and competitive conditions in the overall workers compensation market 
the company also believes that its workers compensation reserves have been established at a level which is consistent with its change in business strategy described above including expense associated with a loss portfolio transfer should such a transfer be completed  although there can be no assurance that this is the case 
state unemployment taxes are  in part  determined by the company s unemployment claims experience 
medical claims experience also greatly impacts the company s health insurance rates and claims cost from year to year  and directly impacts the company under its self insured medical program 
should the company experience a large increase in claims activity for unemployment  workers compensation and or health care  then its costs in these areas would increase 
in such a case  the company may not be able to pass these higher costs to its clients and would therefore have difficulty competing with peos with lower claims rates that may offer lower rates to clients 
the company has an arrangement with its largest client under which the company remains responsible for medical claims above an agreed limit 
while the company does not believe that it will incur material liabilities under this arrangement  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
tax treatment the attractiveness to clients of a full service peo arrangement depends in part upon the tax treatment of payments for particular services and products under the code for example  the opportunity of employees to pay for certain benefits under a cafeteria plan using pre tax dollars 
the internal revenue service irs has formed a market segment study group to examine whether peos  such as the company  are for certain employee benefit and tax purposes the employers of worksite employees under the code 
the company cannot predict either the timing or the nature of any final decision that may be reached by the irs with respect to the market segment study group or the ultimate outcome of any such decision  nor can the company predict whether the treasury department will issue a policy statement with respect to its position on these issues or  if issued  whether such statement would be favorable or unfavorable to the company 
if the irs were to determine that the company is not an employer under certain provisions of the code  it could materially adversely affect the company in several ways 
with respect to benefit plans  the tax qualified status of the company s k plans could be revoked  and the company s cafeteria and medical reimbursement plans may lose their favorable tax status 
if an adverse irs determination were applied retroactively to disqualify benefit plans  employees vested account balances under k plans would become taxable  an administrative employer such as the company would lose its tax deductions to the extent its matching contributions were not vested  a k plan s trust could become a taxable trust and the administrative employer could be subject to liability with respect to its failure to withhold applicable taxes and with respect to certain contributions and trust earnings 
in such event  the company also would face the risk of client dissatisfaction and potential litigation by clients or worksite employees 
as the employer of record for many client companies and their worksite employees  the company must account for and remit payroll  unemployment and other employment related taxes to numerous federal  state and local tax  labor and unemployment authorities  and is subject to substantial penalties for failure to do so 
from time to time  the company has received notices or challenges which may adversely affect its tax rates and payments 
in light of the irs market segment study group and the general uncertainty in this area  certain proposed legislation has been drafted to clarify the employer status of peos in the context of the code and benefit plans 
however  there can be no assurance that such legislation will be proposed and adopted or in what form it would be adopted 
even if it were adopted  the company may need to change aspects of its operations or programs to comply with any requirements which may ultimately be adopted 
in particular  the company may need to retain increased sole or shared control over worksite employees if the legislation is passed in its current form 
credit risks as the employer of record for its worksite employees  the company is obligated to pay their wages  benefit costs and payroll taxes 
the company typically bills a client company for these amounts in advance of or at each payroll date  and reserves the right to terminate its agreement with the client  and thereby the company s liability for future payrolls to the client s worksite employees  if payment is not received within two days of the invoice date 
limited extended payment terms are offered in certain cases subject to local competitive conditions 
the rapid turnaround necessary to process and make payroll payments leaves the company vulnerable to client credit risks  some of which may not be identified prior to the time payroll payments are made 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to timely terminate any delinquent accounts or that its contractual termination rights will be judicially enforced 
in addition  the company has recently entered several market segments through acquisitions in which peos typically advance wages  benefit costs and payroll taxes to their clients 
the company intends to continue this practice despite the potentially greater credit risk posed by such practices 
also  in its stand alone risk management worker s compensation program  the company has structured certain of its clients premium payments so that less than the full premium is billed periodically through the policy year  with the difference to be paid by the client on a deferred basis after the end of the policy year 
following the completion of the company s first series of policy audits  the company determined in late that collection rates from these clients would be lower than expected  due in part to the company s non renewal of the affected policies as part of the overall de emphasis of its stand alone program 
the company conducts a limited credit review before accepting new clients 
however  the nature of the company s business and pricing margins is such that a small number of client credit failures could have an adverse effect on its business and financial performance 
litigation as previously reported  the company and certain of its present and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in ten actions filed between march and may while the exact claims and allegations vary  they all allege violations by the company of section b of the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder  with respect to the accuracy of statements regarding company reserves and other disclosures made by the company and certain directors and officers 
these suits were filed after a significant drop in the trading price of the company s common stock in march each of the actions seeks certification of a class consisting of purchasers of securities of the company over specified periods of time 
each of the complaints seeks the award of compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial  including interest thereon  and costs of the action  including attorneys fees 
the suits have been consolidated before a single judge of the us district court in phoenix  arizona 
the court has appointed lead plaintiffs for the putative class  approved plaintiffs selection of counsel  and ordered plaintiffs to file a consolidated  amended complaint on or about april  the company believes the actions are without merit and intends to defend the cases vigorously 
however  the ultimate resolution of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
client relationships the company s subscriber agreements with its clients generally may be canceled upon days written notice of termination by either party 
while the company believes that it has experienced favorable client retention in the past  there can be no assurance that those relationships will continue or that historical rates of retention will continue to be achieved 
the short term nature of most customer agreements means that clients could terminate a substantial portion of the company s business upon short notice 
through recent acquisitions and internal growth  the percentage of the company s clients in the transportation industry has increased 
while the company has targeted this industry  which it believes could benefit from company services and expertise  increased concentration in a single industry could make the company subject to risks and trends of that industry 
also  certain aspects of the transportation industry may be subject to particular risks  such as the risk of property damage  injury and death from accidents inherent in the operation of a motor vehicle 
in addition  the company is providing driver leasing services through lpc  in which the company acts as sole employer  which may increase risk to the company as a result of the direct nature of the employment relationship 
substantial leverage the company has incurred significant debt primarily in connection with its expansion through acquisitions and its october issuance of the senior notes 
as of december   the company had outstanding senior indebtedness of approximately million and stockholders equity of approximately million 
the company s ability to make scheduled principal payments in respect of  or to pay the interest or liquidated damages  if any  on  or to refinance  any of its indebtedness including the notes will depend on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the company s current level of operations  management believes that cash flow from operations and other available cash  will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated future requirements for working capital expenditures  scheduled lease payments and scheduled payments of interest on its indebtedness  including the notes  for the foreseeable future 
due to financial covenant violations  the company is currently not able to borrow under the amended credit facility  which had been another source of liquidity 
the company may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal of the notes at or prior to maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated growth will occur or that future borrowings will be available under the amended credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service or refinance its indebtedness  including the notes  or make anticipated capital expenditures and lease payments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any such refinancing on commercially reasonable terms 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future could be limited  and iii the notes indenture and the amended credit facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the company to  among other things  borrow additional funds 
failure by the company to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
uncertainty of extent of peo s liability  government regulation of peos employers are regulated by numerous federal and state laws relating to labor  tax and employment matters 
generally  these laws prohibit race  age  sex  disability and religious discrimination  mandate safety regulations in the workplace  set minimum wage rates and regulate employee benefits 
because many of these laws were enacted prior to the development of non traditional employment relationships  such as peo services  many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non traditional co employers such as the company  and there are many legal uncertainties about employee relationships created by peos  such as the extent of the peo s liability for violations of employment and discrimination laws 
the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws even if it does not participate in such violations 
as a result  interpretive issues concerning the definition of the term employer in various federal laws have arisen pertaining to the employment relationship 
unfavorable resolution of these issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s standard forms of client service agreement establish the contractual division of responsibilities between the company and its clients for various personnel management matters  including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations 
however  because the company acts as a co employer  and in some instances acts as sole employer such as in the driver leasing program  the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws despite these contractual provisions  even if it does not participate in such violations 
the circumstances in which the company acts as sole employer may expose the company to increased risk of such liabilities for an employee s actions 
the company has been sued in tort actions alleging responsibility for employee actions which it considers to be incidental to its business 
although it believes it has meritorious defenses  and maintains insurance and requires its clients to maintain insurance covering certain of such liabilities  there can be no assurances that the company will not be found to be liable for damages in any such suit  or that such liability would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
although the client generally is required to indemnify the company for any liability attributable to the conduct of the client or employee  the company may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities 
in addition  employees of the client may be deemed to be agents of the company  subjecting the company to liability for the actions of such employees 
while many states do not explicitly regulate peos  various states have passed laws that have licensing or registration requirements and other states are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations of any particular state from time to time 
government regulation relating to workers compensation program as part of its risk management workers compensation programs  the company has utilized camelback  a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary 
insurance companies such as camelback are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are chartered  such laws and regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than the interests of shareholders such as the company 
in general  insurance regulatory authorities have broad administrative authority over insurers domiciled in their respective jurisdictions  including authority over insurers capital and surplus levels  dividend payments  financial disclosure  reserve requirements  investment parameters and premium rates 
the jurisdictions also limit the ability of an insurer to transfer or loan statutory capital or surplus to its affiliates 
the regulation of camelback could materially adversely affect the company s operations and results 
competition the market for many of the services provided by the company is highly fragmented  with over  peos currently competing in the united states 
many of these peos have limited operations with relatively few worksite employees  but the company believes that several are larger than or comparable to the company in size 
the company also competes with non peo companies whose offerings overlap with some of the company s services  including payroll processing firms  insurance companies  temporary personnel companies and human resource consulting firms 
in addition  as the peo industry becomes better established  the company expects that competition will continue to increase as existing peo firms consolidate into fewer and better competitors and well organized new entrants with potentially greater resources than the company  including some of the non peo companies described above  continue to enter the peo market 
the company s subscriber agreements with its clients generally may be canceled upon days written notice of termination by either party 
the short term nature of most customer agreements means that a substantial portion of the company s business could be terminated upon short notice 
in the stand alone risk management workers compensation services area  the company considers state insurance funds and other private insurance carriers to be its primary competition 
year compliance many computer programs process transactions based on using two digits for the year of the transaction rather than a full four year digits eg for 
systems that process year transactions with the year may encounter significant processing inaccuracies or inoperability 
management has determined that  like most other companies  it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its information systems will be able to properly utilize dates subsequent to december  the year issue will be addressed through either the modification of existing software or conversion to new software 
however  if such transition is not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company began developing its plan to address year in the plan includes hardware  software  electronic equipment and building systems  and evaluates risk associated with vendor readiness 
based on developments to date  the company expects that the plan will be completed in a timely fashion and that year issues will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s expectation in this regard is based upon numerous assumptions of future events including the availability of certain resources  third party modifications and other factors  and there can be no assurance that the company s current expectations will be met
