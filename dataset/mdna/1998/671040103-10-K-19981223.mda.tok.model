liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital representing primarily cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregated approximately million 
the company is dependent upon collaborative research revenues  government research grants  interest income and cash balances  and will remain so until products developed from its technology are successfully commercialized 
the company believes that with the funding from its collaborative research programs  government research grants  interest income  and cash balances  its financial resources are adequate for its operations for approximately the next four years based on its current business plan even if no milestone payments or royalties are received during this period 
however  the company s capital requirements may vary as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  competitive and technological developments  funds required for further expansion or enhancement of the company s technology platform  including possible additional joint ventures  collaborations and acquisitions  potential milestone payments  and the time and expense required to obtain governmental approval of products  some of which factors are beyond the company s control 
one of the company s strategic objectives is to manage its financial resources and the growth of its drug discovery and development programs so as to balance its proprietary efforts and funded collaborations 
in pursuing this objective  the company in fiscal has expanded the scope of its discovery and development activities without significantly increasing its rate of cash consumption 
the company expects to continue its current level of expenditures and capital investment over the next several years to enhance its drug discovery technologies and pursue internal proprietary drug discovery programs 
there can be no assurance that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that government research grants will continue to be received at current levels  that milestone payments will be made  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any additional required funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain additional funds when required would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year the company is aware of the challenges associated with the inability of certain systems to properly format information after december  the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year problem on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
substantially all of the company s biology and chemistry databases are stored on oracle tables and isis chemical structure databases  which are year compliant  as are its novell network servers 
the company is currently converting its financial records to an oracle based system and is in the process of implementing a new planning and budgeting package  both of which are year compliant 
the company expects these systems to be operational by december  the company believes it will fully remediate any of its year programs in advance of the year and does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as the result of any failure by the company to fully remediate such programs 
based on current information  the cost of addressing remaining potential year problems associated with the company s internal systems and operations are not expected to have a material adverse impact to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in future periods 
the company has not conducted an evaluation of the extent to which the operations of the material third parties with whom it regularly deals may be disrupted by any year non compliance of any of their systems 
these third parties include the company s collaborative partners and its suppliers and vendors 
disruption of the operations of any of its partners could delay or halt important research and development programs  cause the loss of data or have other unforeseen consequences 
the company is currently planning to contact all significant collaborators  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions in order to identify potential areas of concern 
it is anticipated that this inquiry will be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year problems experienced by the company s suppliers and vendors could cause a disruption of the company s operations 
the company currently is unable to estimate the likelihood of any of these risks being realized  or if realized  the impact they may have on the company 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if necessary  the company intends to create a contingency plan to identify and document potential business disruptions and continuity planning procedures 
the focus of this activity would be on potential failures of external systems required to carry out normal business operations including services provided by the public infrastructure such as  but not limited to  power  electric  transportation and telecommunications 
the company expects this activity to be on an on going process throughout fiscal new accounting pronouncement in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
