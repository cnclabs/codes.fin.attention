loss and lae incurred during the quarter increased from million to million  a increase  resulting in loss ratios of and in and  respectively 
loss ratios for transportation lines decreased from to 
the decreases in ratios were spread across product lines and were the result of improved loss experience and increased revenues 
commercial lines loss ratios increased from for the quarter ending december  to in as a result of increased claims and pricing competition 
personal lines experienced worsening results during the quarter  the result of higher claims in automobile liability insurance and to increased frequency of claims in the homeowners line 
policy acquisition costs decreased during the period due to reduced incentive profit sharing commissions  which resulted from american country s poor underwriting performance for the period 
selling and general expenses also decreased during the fourth quarter of as compared to due to savings initiated with the acquisition and also due to the results of repositioning and refocusing of operations since the acquisition 
total investment income and realized investment gains for the quarter increased million from million in to million in the increase in realized gains accounted for most of this increase 
this increase was the result of a change in investment philosophy after the acquisition and the appointment of independent fixed income managers that occurred at the end of the third quarter 
other income for the period  which represents interest and fees earned on premium finance activities  increased to  in from  for calendar year compared to calendar year the following table sets forth the net premiums earned by the principal lines or products of insurance underwritten by american country for the periods indicated and the dollar amount and percentage of change therein from year to year net premiums earned year ended increase decrease december  to in thousands amount transportation lines    commercial lines    personal lines   totals   transportation lines  which consists of taxi and limousine liability and physical damage programs  grew during the period as more accounts were underwritten and american country began its geographic diversification program after the acquisition in july  total premium revenues generated by this line increased nearly over the prior year to million in from million in this increase is attributable to coverage written for chicago suburban taxis and limousines and american country s expansion into the states of michigan and wisconsin 
commercial lines continued its decline in revenue contribution by decreasing more than over this decrease was due to the continuing soft market being experienced industry wide 
average premiums on american country s workers compensation line its largest commercial lines product decreased on new business over the same period for and on renewal business 
management is observing this situation very closely and in the fourth quarter of instituted a re underwriting program to reevaluate each risk on the policy s renewal date 
personal lines premiums generated revenues of million in  representing a increase over that was almost entirely attributable to homeowners insurance 
this slower growth rate over the recent years represents action taken by management due to its concern with the poor returns experienced for this line

with an increase in invested assets of in  net investment income and realized gains on investments increased over  due principally to increased realized gains 
although investment expenses increased more than for the full year  since the acquisition investment expense has been substantially reduced on an ongoing basis by eliminating investment fees previously paid to the former parent of the company and by changing the custodial bank

american country s transportation lines continued to perform well  resulting in a combined ratio of for this compared to a combined ratio for this slight deterioration is attributable to a slight increase in the loss and lae ratio and to increased acquisition costs due to geographic expansion of this program during the fourth quarter 
the loss ratio for the commercial lines increased from during to in  resulting in an increase of the combined ratio of from to in and  respectively 
the increase reflects the continuing industry wide decline in net premiums written for this type of insurance primarily due to price competition 
as with the personal lines  management is closely evaluating this line  with special emphasis being placed on re underwriting individual risks and programs to improve returns 
the loss ratio for personal lines during increased to compared to for  due to a general increase in claims  and the occurrence of two catastrophic losses during the period 
as a result of the poor results derived from this line of business  management decided to significantly reduce its business in this line  and effective january   entered into an agreement with ohio casualty pursuant to which nearly all of this line was reinsured by ohio casualty without further exposure to american country 
commission and acquisition costs were slightly higher for  which is attributable to the fact that american country s business written by independent producers increased in general and administrative expenses increased due in part to nonrecurring expenses of approximately million associated with the acquisition and related activities and with interest expense on the bank loan incurred in connection with the acquisition

the company expects that expenses associated with year compliance will not exceed  the company has also discussed year issues with american country s policy maintenance and claims service providers  and it is management s belief that these providers are properly addressing year issues 
with these changes and others planned  it is management s belief that the company should have no material exposure to the year issue 
the calendar year compared to the calendar year the following table sets forth the net premiums earned by the principal lines or products of insurance written by american country for the periods indicated and the dollar amount and percentage of change therein from period to period net premiums earned year ended increase decrease december  to amount in thousands transportation lines    commercial lines    personal lines    totals    transportation lines  which consists of american country s taxi and limousine liability and physical damage programs underwritten in the chicago metropolitan area  experienced growth during as compared to in its suburban and association taxi cab business 
the revenues generated by this line when expressed as a percentage of total premiums earned  increased from in to during commercial lines premiums decreased as a result of continuing price competition  especially in the workers compensation and non specialty commercial automobile products lines 
the increase in revenues generated from personal lines was principally due to the continued expansion of this line  which was initiated in the greatest increase was in homeowners insurance  which increased during by more than over net investment income increased in primarily as a result of the increase in interest earned on the company s portfolio of fixed maturities and to slightly improved yields over dividends earned decreased during due to the significant reduction in the common equity position during the year 
other interest earned  largely on short term commercial paper decreased as a result of lower yields on these investments 
the increase in realized gains during was achieved as a result of the strong performance in the securities markets throughout the year 
additionally  management utilized the opportunity to realize losses on certain invested assets which had been previously written down which enabled the company to take the realized loss on these securities for tax purposes and thereby achieve tax advantages 
other income  which consists of interest and fees earned on premium finance activities  increased during to  due entirely to the increase in the number of contracts financed 
the following table sets forth the company s statutory combined ratio and gaap combined ratio for the periods indicated statutory combined ratio gaap combined ratio year ended december  year ended december  losses loss adjustment expenses lae losses and lae policy acquisition  other underwriting expenses total combined ratio losses and loss adjustment expenses for increased over in about the same proportion as did premium revenues 
transportation lines experienced a decrease in its losses and loss adjustment expense ratio from for to for this decrease is attributable to lower claims under taxi and limousine policies  as well as a decrease in loss adjustment expenses 
the commercial lines loss ratio increased from in to as a result of continuing higher losses and the continuing effects of aggressive competition resulting in lower premiums for the commercial lines business 
the increase in personal lines loss ratio is principally due to american country experiencing its first catastrophic loss in july in its homeowners insurance line 
selling and general expenses increased million or in as compared to due primarily to the increase in acquisition expense as a result of increased premium revenues 
also  due to this increased premium volume  salaries and benefits expense increased over the previous year 
asset portfolio review at december   the company s total assets of million was comprised of the following cash and investments   reinsurance recoverables   premiums receivable   deferred expenses policy acquisition costs and deferred taxes  fixed assets   and other assets  
the company generally invests in securities with fixed maturities with the objective of providing reasonable returns while limiting liquidity and credit risk 
as a result  its investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income debt securities which are rated as investment grade with a carrying value of million and constituting of the company s fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  the company s fixed asset maturity securities included mortgage backed bonds of million and  respectively  which are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments can cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss  while securities that have an amortized cost less than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster that expected will generate an increase in gain or yield 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
at december   the following table provides a profile of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio by rating s p moody s rating amount market percent of value portfolio aaa aaa including us treasuries of   aa aa  a a  bbb bbb  all other  total  liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  the company receives cash principally through fees and dividends from subsidiaries and borrowings  certain of which are subject to dividend restrictions and regulatory approval 
the ability of insurance companies to underwrite insurance is based on maintaining liquidity and capital resources sufficient to pay claims and expenses as they become due 
the primary sources of liquidity for american country are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income  commissions and fee income  capital contributions from the company and proceeds from the sales and maturities of portfolio investments 
the principal expenditures are for payment of losses and lae  operating expenses  commissions and dividends to shareholders 
the company believes its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
the company maintains a liquid operating position and follows investment guidelines that are intended to provide acceptable return on investment while preserving capital  maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations and maintaining a sufficient margin of capital and surplus to ensure american country s unimpaired ability to write insurance 
cash flow generated from operations for the year ended december  and was million and million respectively  which amounts were adequate to meet all obligations during the periods 
the decrease in cash flow for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily related to the decrease in net income 
on july   the company obtained a million revolving loan credit facility under which it borrowed million at an initial rate of based upon libor  payable quarterly  to fund a portion of the million paid in connection with the acquisition 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company may borrow up to million at a floating rate of interest 
the amount that may be borrowed under the agreement is reduced to million at july  million at july  and expires in july at december   the unused portion of the line of credit was million 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding line of credit was as of december  total interest expense and interest paid in was  and  respectively 
the line of credit agreement contains various debt covenants including certain financial covenants and commitment fees  which are 
per annum of the unused line of credit 
the company is in compliance with all covenants of the agreement 
income taxes the company s federal income tax returns for all periods prior to the acquisition were consolidated with those of its former owner 
income tax expenses were computed on a separate company basis 
for the period april   through july   american country and financial services will file a consolidated return with its previous parent  american country holdings corp 
effective with the acquisition  the company will file its tax return on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries 
regulation in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the naic and individual states have enacted certain laws and financial statement changes 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specific corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level or  with negative trend 
the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for american company were in excess of their required amounts at both december  and the naic is currently in the process of recodifying statutory accounting practices  the result of which is expected to constitute the only source of prescribed statutory accounting practices 
accordingly  that project  which is expected to be completed in  will likely change  to some extent  prescribed  statutory accounting practices  and may result in changes in the company s insurance subsidiary s statutory surplus 
the purpose of these regulatory efforts at all levels is to improve the solvency of insurers 
these regulatory initiatives  and the overall focus on solvency  may intensify the restructuring and consolidation of the insurance industry 
while the impact of these regulatory efforts on the company s operations cannot be quantified until enacted  the company believes it will be adequately positioned to compete in an environment of more stringent regulation 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  american country attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  american country may be limited in raising its premiums commensurate with anticipated inflation  in which event american country  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on american country s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on american country s investment income
