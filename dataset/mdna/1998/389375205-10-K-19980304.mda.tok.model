the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and the stations also pay commissions to the national sales representative on national advertising 
broadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season
