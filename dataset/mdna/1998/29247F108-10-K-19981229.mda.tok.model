the company s net sales have increased from million in fiscal the company s first full year of operations to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
the growth in net sales has principally been driven by sales to new customers and increased sales to existing customers as well as geographic expansion through the opening of additional sales offices

net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts

because the company s business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  the company does not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
the company typically does not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or the company s configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of the company s net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although the company maintains a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  it records as inventory the merchandise being configured and products purchased from distributors  but not yet shipped to customers

the largest consumer of cash was the growth of accounts receivable related to the company s sales expansion and extended collection period of the receivables 
in fiscal  million in cash was so expended  while million was used in the prior fiscal year 
historically  the company has satisfied its accounts receivable cash requirements principally by borrowings under its lines of credit 
the company s accounts receivable balance at september  and  was million and million  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days and days  as of september  and  respectively 
at september   restricted cash amounted to million and related principally to unexpended funds from the million of equipment financing targeted for the ontario integration  repair  and rma facility see financing activities below 
investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal compared with million used in the prior year 
the increase in cash used for investing activities is principally from the build up of the ontario integration  repair  and rma facility  a  square foot state of the art facility 
such cash invested totaled million  million of which related to ontario building improvements 
another million was invested in computer program costs  for software to handle the growing services business 
the remaining million of property and equipment purchases were for upgrades and improvements to existing systems and for equipment to furnish new branch offices 
financing activities provided net cash totaling million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  mostly from borrowings on lines of credit which have been used primarily to finance accounts receivable balances which have grown as a result of increased sales 
another million was provided from equipment financing for the ontario facility  of which million remained in restricted cash 
as of september   the company had approximately million in cash  including million in restricted cash  and working capital of million 
the company has several revolving credit facilities collateralized by accounts receivable and all other assets of the company  including million in lines with ibmcc

com asset  management believes that a restructuring of its operations and possibly an additional cash infusion will be necessary and is actively pursuing exploration of its options 
as a result  a charge  which may be material  but which cannot now be quantified is expected to be recognized in the period when such a restructuring and plan are approved by the board of directors 
the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is concerned with whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year problems are pervasive and complex as virtually every company s computer operation may be affected in some way 
as a result of the company s analysis of its computer programs and operations  it has reached the conclusion that its own business systems  including its computer systems are not fully prepared for year although management believes that corrections planned by the company will not seriously impact or have a material adverse effect on the company s expenses  business  including data gathering and interpretation  or its operations 
it is possible  however  that year problems incurred by the customers or suppliers of the company could have a negative impact on future operations and financial performance of the company  although the company has not been able to specifically identify any such problems among its suppliers 
the company believes that it will not be dependent upon any single supplier or customer for its equipment or supplies or sales in the year  it has contacted its primary suppliers to determine if they are developing plans to address processing transactions which may impact the company 
furthermore  the year problem may impact other entities with which the company transacts business and the company cannot predict the effect of the year problem on such entities or the resulting effect on the company 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan to operate in the event that any non compliant customer or supplier systems that materially impact the company are not remedied in a timely manner and has not yet determined a time table for developing such a plan 
as a result  if preventative and or corrective actions by the company or those entities with which the company does business are not made in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  based on its analysis to date  the expenses of the company s efforts to identify and address such problems  or the expenses or liabilities to which the company may become subject as a result of such problems  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as well  the purchasing patterns of existing and potential customers may be affected by year problems  which could cause fluctuations in the company s sales volumes
