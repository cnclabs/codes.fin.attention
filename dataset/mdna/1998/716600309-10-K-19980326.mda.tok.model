item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview in analyzing the company s results  investors should consider a variety of factors unique to the company and the heating oil industry 
these include the company s active acquisition program and the rapid rate of amortization of customer lists purchased in home heating oil acquisitions 
first  the financial results of a given year do not reflect the full impact of the year s acquisitions 
acquisitions made during the spring and summer months generally have a negative effect on earnings in the calendar year in which they are made 
second  substantially all purchased intangibles are comprised of customer lists and convenants not to compete 
amortization of customer lists is a non cash expense which is amortized over a six year period and the balance over a year period 
the covenants not to compete are amortized over the lives of the covenants  which generally range from five to seven years 
a significant focus of the company has been the restructuring and corporate identity programs begun in april of these programs are targeted to heighten responsiveness to customers  improve brand awareness among heating oil consumers and increase operational productivity  as well as reduce overhead costs 
the regionalization of the company s new york long island operations was completed in  and similar efforts in the mid atlantic region have begun

million of the proceeds from this sale were set aside to collateralize a portion of outstanding acquisition letters of credit 
cash collateral requirements had originally been scheduled to begin in june net cash provided by operating activities of million combined with the million net proceeds from the exchangeable preferred stock offering and the million from the sale of its branch in hartford connecticut described in the preceding paragraph  amounted to million

these steps include the suspension of the common stock dividend  reduction in planned capital expenditures  selected elimination of corporate positions  and freezing of salaries  as well as significant operating expense reductions 
despite these efforts  as well as an improvement in the company s retail heating oil gross profit margins  however  the company still expects to be significantly impacted by the extremely warm weather experienced in january and february 
the company expects to renew or replace the working capital revolving credit facility and based on this and the company s current working capital position and expected net cash provided by operating activities  the company expects to be able to meet all of the above mentioned obligations in year the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and is developing an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  which the company expects to implement on a timely basis  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
estimated costs associated with this conversion is anticipated to be less then two hundred thousand dollars 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem may have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company
