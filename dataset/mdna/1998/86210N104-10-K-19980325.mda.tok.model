item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eccs provides intelligent solutions to store  protect and access mission critical information for the open systems and related markets 
the company designs  manufactures and sells high performance  fault tolerant data storage solutions for a wide range of customer requirements 
from its founding until  the company s principal business was the value added resale of ncr products 
sales to at t business units made up a large portion of such business 
during  as a result of at t s acquisition of ncr and subsequent change in its purchasing policies  the company undertook a product development initiative to reposition the company as a provider of proprietary mass storage enhancement products 
in  the company s sales of its proprietary products exceeded its sales as a var due to both increasing sales of its own products and decreasing sales as a var 
beginning in  a substantial portion of the company s revenues has been generated from sales of its own products 
the company s revenues are generated from three primary sources i revenues derived from sales of mass storage enhancement products  which include sales of all eccs mass storage enhancement products  including the synchronix family of products  and sales of certain third party component products that are incorporated into such mass storage enhancement systems  ii revenues generated by the company as a var which include the company s sales to at t business units for non storage related products  and iii revenues derived from services and other revenue which include professional services and maintenance contracts 
the company believes that revenues generated by the company as a var  which include sales to at t business units of non storage related products  will be minimal in the future 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales derived from each of the product groupings the company uses to analyze sales and revenue year ended december  eccs mass storage enhancement products including all eccs proprietary products and certain third party component products value added resales services and other revenues the year to year percentage increases in sales by the company of is proprietary systems  as well as the year to year percentage decreases in sales by the company in its capacity as a var are due  primarily  to the company s repositioning as a provider of its own proprietary mass storage enhancement systems including storage subsystems 
most of the company s proprietary products are manufactured under contract by unisys pursuant to the company s specifications 
in accordance with the company s instructions  unisys ships the finished product directly to the company s customers 
the company believes that by outsourcing certain manufacturing requirements  the company benefits from the greater purchasing power of the manufacturers  reduction of inventory carrying costs and the avoidance of certain investments in plant  property and equipment 
product sales revenue is generally recognized upon product shipment 
periodically  however  revenue is recognized for product which is being held at the customer s request 
revenue is only recognized on such product when all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has no specific performance obligations remaining 
the company s cost of revenues relating to product sales consists primarily of the costs of purchased material  direct labor and related overhead expenses  and amortization of capitalized software 
an increase in proprietary product sales combined with the anticipated continued reduction in the sale of third party product  which typically carries lower margins  is expected to lower cost of revenues as a percentage of sales 
costs of revenues related to services are comprised primarily of direct labor and related overhead expenses 
the company s oem sales to date have been primarily to unisys and tandem 
in march  the company commenced sales of products to tandem for resale 
on march   the company announced that it had signed a corporate purchasing agreement with tandem pursuant to which tandem has the ability to purchase synchronix from the company and resell synchronix under a private label with tandem s own systems 
the company s sales to tandem will be made by purchase order 
therefore  the company has no long term commitments from tandem and tandem generally may cancel orders upon appropriate written notice to the company 
there can be no assurance that orders from tandem will continue at their historic levels or that the company will be able to obtain any new orders from tandem 
in addition  in january  the company and tandem announced their intent to develop a raid storage connectivity for a system area network for the open systems market 
the company and tandem are seeking to develop a native servernet system connectivity for synchronix for departmental and enterprise clusters 
no revenues were generated from this arrangement during there can be no assurances that a definitive agreement will be reached with tandem 
the profitability of any particular quarter is significantly affected by the relative sales levels of each of the company s primary sales channels oem  federal and commercial 
gross margins on products shipped to commercial customers generally provide higher margins  followed by oem and federal 
to the extent that the company is successful in increasing its sales of synchronix and synchronection to the commercial market directly and through oem arrangements  the company believes gross margins should improve accordingly 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of salaries  commissions and travel costs for sales and marketing personnel  trade shows and expenses associated with the company s management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
the company anticipates that sg a spending levels will decrease as a percentage of sales to the extent sales to oems increase as a percentage of sales 
sales to oems typically absorb much of the administrative burden otherwise incurred by the company 
since  the company has increased its research and development activity in connection with the development of synchronix and synchronection 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers and programmers 
research and development expenses are anticipated to increase substantially  in the near future  to enable the company to update and expand upon its existing product offerings and to integrate its products into systems of future oems 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond the company s control

historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem 
in december  the company began developing an implementation plan for a new enterprise management system to internally resolve the year problem 
the company expects to complete such implementation by the first quarter of as part of the process  the company is currently evaluating options with respect to the replacement of certain hardware and software to make its computer systems year compliant 
presently  the company does not believe that year compliance will result in material investments by the company  nor does the company anticipate that the year problem will have material adverse effects on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the year problem will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that its existing available cash  credit facilities and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations  will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations for at least the next months 
the company s operating results are affected by seasonal factors  particularly the spending fluctuations of its largest customers including unisys  tandem and the federal government 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of the company s costs  a decline in net sales in any fiscal quarter typically results in lower profitability in that quarter 
the company does not expect such spending fluctuations to be altered in the future 
a significant reduction in orders from any of the company s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s largest customers will continue to place orders with the company or that orders of its customers will continue at their previous levels
