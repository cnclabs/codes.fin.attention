the company s net income increased to  compared with a net income of  in liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the decrease in cash flow is primarily due to increased inventories  as well as decreased income taxes payable due to the timing of foreign tax payments  and payments made during for the favorable settlement reached with the internal revenue service at the end of dollars in thousands  except share data capital expenditures were  in   in  and  in the largest expenditures in were for new business projects including the construction of pilot plants at salsbury chemicals and zeeland chemicals which incorporate cgmp capabilities 
these facilities have begun actual production in the fourth quarter of other expenditures were mostly for plant upgrades  including additional batch still capabilities at our harriman facility 
on september   the company entered into a new five year credit agreement the agreement with a bank group headed by the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent and the first national bank of chicago as documentation agent 
the bank group has a total of domestic banks and international banks 
the agreement provides the company with a  borrowing facility 
the new agreement replaces the previously existing revolving credit agreement with nbd bank  na the company has pledged of the common stock of the company s foreign subsidiaries as collateral 
the agreement permits the company to choose between various interest rate options 
under the agreement  the interest rate options available to the company are a us prime rate or b libor plus the applicable margin ranging from 
of to 
of or c competitive bid at a libor rate borrowing or a fixed rate borrowing to be determined by auction 
the applicable margin is adjusted based upon the funded indebtedness to cash flow ratio of the company 
additionally  the company pays a commitment fee of between 
to 
on the entire portion of the agreement 
on september   the company utilized  of the agreement in order to repay the then outstanding balance under the previously existing revolving credit agreement 
on september   the company borrowed  to finance the acquisition of the outstanding common stock of biowhittaker 
of this amount   was utilized on september  to acquire the of biowhittaker shares which had been tendered at that date 
the company subsequently utilized the remaining portion to finance the acquisition of the remaining of biowhittaker on october  the undrawn borrowing availability under the agreement as of december  was  there is  outstanding as of december  management is of the opinion that these amounts  together with cash flows from operations  are adequate for meeting the company s operating  financing and capital requirements 
on july   the company raised  in a public offering  which was used to pay down outstanding debt  short term bridge loan   long term under the old credit agreement 
effective july   the board of directors approved a three for two split of the company s common stock  
par value  in the form of a stock dividend for holders of record on july  after giving effect to a three for two stock split approved by the company s board of directors on july   the company paid cash dividends of per share in a regular cash dividend has been declared by the board of directors on the company s common stock since the fourth quarter  the company buys materials and sells products in a variety of currencies in various parts of the world 
its results are therefore impacted by changes in the relative value of currencies in which it deals 
prior to the acquisition of nordic and profarmaco in october   this risk was not considered to be significant and the company had no program to mitigate foreign currency risk 
the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our foreign operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  deutsche mark and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency forward exchange and has used put and call option contracts in the past to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts is  which the company estimates to be approximately of the foreign currency exposure during the period covered resulting in a deferred currency loss of at december  an additional  of the foreign currency exposure is protected through export financing

through the activities of its predecessors and third parties in connection with the handling and disposal of hazardous and other wastes  the company may become liable  irrespective of fault  for certain site remediation costs under federal and state environmental statutes 
descriptions of such environmentally related contingencies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference 
during january  an opinion was rendered against cosan chemical corporation a subsidiary of cambrex by the united states district court of new jersey in a matter that has been pending since the opinion addressed cosan s liability for contamination at a site in clifton  new jersey which was previously owned and operated by cosan 
in the opinion  cosan was found liable for past remediation costs in the amount of approximately plus prejudgment interest on such costs 
additionally  cosan was found primarily responsible for the future remediation costs for the site 
the judge also awarded treble damages on the past costs  prejudgment interest and future costs 
to avoid treble damages for future costs  cosan entered into an administrative consent order with the state to perform a major portion of the future remediation at the site 
during  the judge reversed the decision regarding prejudgment interest 
also  during  both cosan and the plaintiffs appealed various aspects of the decision 
in january  the appeals were heard before the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
a decision has not been rendered 
the estimated range of costs for this case have been considered in the company s reserve assessment 
during november  a settlement was reached between nepera  inc a subsidiary of the company  a former owner of the nepera facility and the original owner of the facility pertaining to past and future costs of remediating two sites 
under the terms of the settlement  the original site owner has placed in escrow approximately  to provide for past and future remediation costs at the two sites in exchange for a release from the requirement to clean up the two sites 
after certain administrative proceedings  the funds will be placed in a trust for the benefit of remediating the two sites on behalf of nepera and the other former site owner 
as permitted under the terms of the agreement  nepera is eligible to recover and has sought to recover  of past costs from this settlement which was recognized in the results of operations and a receivable for this amount in the financial statements 
the remaining funds available from this settlement should be sufficient to provide for the future remediation costs for these two sites based upon current estimates of such costs 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight and or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate extent of liabilities with respect to such matters as well as the timing of related cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
however  management is of the opinion that while the ultimate liability resulting from these matters may have a material effect upon the results of operations in any given year  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity nor its financial position
