amc provided comprehensive pharmacy and related services to approximately  residents in long term care facilities in states 
the cash purchase price of amc was approximately million  including bank debt totaling million  which was retired immediately following the acquisition 
the company also increases its revenues internally through the efforts of its national sales and marketing group and pharmacy staff in developing new pharmacy contracts with long term care facilities 
expansion of services such as infusion therapy and the increasing acuity levels of residents in long term care facilities which results from efforts made to avoid or reduce hospitalization  together with drug price inflation and other changes in sales mix also contribute to the company s revenue growth 
the company s total sales increased by million in versus the company estimates that approximately million of its consolidated revenue growth in was attributable to acquisitions

gross margin remained constant at from to changes in sales mix including increased infusion therapy sales  the company s purchasing leverage associated with purchases of pharmaceuticals and leveraging fixed and variable overhead costs at the company s pharmacies positively impacted gross margins

sales of pharmaceuticals account for the majority of the company s sales and gross profit
