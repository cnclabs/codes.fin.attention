item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
these acquisition opportunities may arise as routes are sold in response to regulatory requirements or in order to eliminate duplicate routes 
almost all of the rail lines operated by the company were previously operated by four of north america s largest railroads 
railtex also believes it has many opportunities to expand its portfolio by acquiring existing short line railroads in both the united states and canada 
in addition  the company believes that international rail privatization may offer additional long term opportunities as certain governments privatize their country s rail systems 
the company s strategy regarding international acquisitions includes analyzing the country s political and economic environment  identifying potential country risks and attracting strong local investment partners 
additionally  the company has developed certain guidelines regarding the percentage of assets and equity invested in international acquisitions in relation to total assets and equity 
the company has consistently increased the traffic volume and operating efficiency of its portfolio of railroad properties 
railtex credits its operating record in large part to its process oriented performance based management approach and decentralized management structure  which places primary operating responsibility for each railroad with local management  and its incentive based compensation programs  which reward employees for improving customer service and operating results 
unlike major rail carriers  the company also benefits from its flexible work environment in which the company s railroads can assign their operating employees to tasks on an as needed basis without regard for traditional railroad industry craft distinctions pursuant to which railroad operating employees are assigned to tasks based upon narrowly defined job descriptions 
railtex believes its established reputation as an acquirer and operator of railroad properties  in combination with its managerial and financial resources  has positioned the company to take advantage of future growth opportunities 
the company was incorporated in texas in december  and until its principal business was the short term  full service leasing and management of open top aggregate hopper railcars 
in october  railtex entered the short line freight railroad business by contracting to operate the san diego imperial valley railroad 
by year end  the company s short line railroad portfolio had grown to six rail lines and generated of the company s operating revenues 
in mid  railtex sold its railcar leasing assets  utilizing the sale proceeds to purchase additional short line railroad properties 
since the sale of its railcar leasing assets  the company s sole business activity has been the operation of short line railroads 
the company added three short line railroad properties to its portfolio in  six properties in  one property in  four properties in  three properties in  one property in  one property in  four properties in and one property in the company also invested in two separate companies which began operating newly privatized railroads in brazil in and industry overview the us railroad industry is dominated by four major class i railroads  which operated approximately  miles of track at year end the most recent year for which data is available and represented billion  or  of total rail industry operating revenues of billion in in addition to the large railroads  at year end there were more than short line and regional railroads  such as the company  which generated billion of operating revenues in and operated approximately  miles of track at year end reflecting downsizing by major rail carriers  the proportion of total track miles operated by short line and regional railroads in the united states increased to of total railroad industry track miles in from in the staggers rail act of staggers act enabled many of the structural changes in the us rail industry which have favorably affected the company s ability to add short line railroads 
canada s national transportation act of liberalized the process for branch line divestiture  much as the staggers act facilitated the process for us railroads see page 
as a result of deregulation  major railroads have been able to concentrate their management and marketing attention on core  long haul routes  while divesting through sale or lease many of their branch lines to smaller and more cost efficient freight railroad operators such as railtex 
the major railroads have derived significant benefits from the divesting of branch lines to short line operators 
divesting these branch lines allows major railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures  increase traffic density and improve railcar utilization 
because of the focus of short line railroads on increasing traffic volume through increased customer service and more efficient operations  traffic volume on short line railroads frequently increases after divestiture 
consequently  these transactions often result in net increases in divesting carriers freight traffic because much of the business originating or terminating on branch lines feeds into divesting carriers core routes 
the timing and pace of railtex s acquisition activity with class i railroads is primarily dependent upon a timetable established by the class i railroads 
the company is continually proactively reviewing potential acquisitions for rail lines offered by the class i railroads  however  the number of lines available for acquisition is often affected by class i merger activity or other commitments of the class i railroads resources 
since  more than short line and regional railroads  operating approximately  miles of track  have been created in the united states primarily as a result of divestiture by major rail carriers 
the company believes this trend is likely to provide a continuing source of expansion opportunities for the next several years 
in addition  there are over other small railroads  most of which are owned by other railroads  non railroad companies  investment partnerships  and individuals 
the company has purchased four of the railroad properties it operates from sellers other than major railroads  and believes other independent railroad operators represent significant additional sources of desirable properties 
the timing and pace of the acquisition of existing short line railroads is primarily a function of identifying the seller and then successfully negotiating financial  tax  and other considerations 
business strategy the company s strategy is to grow through i additions to its portfolio of short line railroad properties  primarily through strategic acquisitions of class i railroad divestitures or independently owned shortlines which complement railtex s current base of railroad properties  ii creation of new business on currently owned properties  and iii improvement in the operating performance of newly added and currently operated properties 
railtex believes its expertise in adding railroad properties to its portfolio and its focus on customer service  employee productivity and operating efficiency position it to implement effectively its strategy 
expansion strategy the key components of railtex s expansion strategy are strategic acquisitions railtex believes that its current base of core properties throughout the us and canada provide it with a substantial advantage in acquiring railroad properties in geographic proximity to the currently owned properties 
in these instances  railtex expects to achieve certain operating and marketing efficiencies by combining the operations of the acquired railroad with an existing railroad 
diversification railtex believes that its revenue diversification limits its exposure to geographic  economic and customer related risks  while it positions the company to take advantage of a broad range of business opportunities 
this diversification  and the stability it provides to the company s operations  differentiates railtex from regional and other short line carriers 
diversification also enables the company to develop and maintain close working relationships with essentially all major rail carriers in north america 
experience railtex believes it has positioned itself as a reliable  experienced acquirer and operator of railroad properties 
the company believes its record  evidenced by its acquisition  integration and operation of rail properties since  gives the company a competitive advantage over other bidders for short line railroad properties 
railtex also believes its ability to finance and close transactions and commence operations in a timely manner is well recognized by the major rail carriers 
in addition  the company believes it has developed good relationships with the major rail carriers and that these relationships provide an advantage in competing for additional properties 
operating strategy railtex s operating strategy is to improve the performance of its same railroad and newly added properties by focusing on improved customer service and operating efficiency 
the key components of railtex s operating strategy are customer service the company seeks to build its business by aggressively marketing and delivering convenient and cost effective service to meet its customers transportation needs 
to this end  the company works with its customers to assess their requirements  and then tailors its operations to increase the frequency and reliability of service 
the company believes its efforts to enhance customer service have generally resulted in increased traffic with customers along the company s lines 
operating efficiency railtex focuses on promoting cost efficient operations at all levels of its organization 
unlike major rail carriers  the company benefits from its flexible work environment in which the company s railroads can assign their operating employees to tasks on an as needed basis without regard for traditional railroad industry craft distinctions pursuant to which railroad operating employees are assigned to tasks based upon narrowly defined job descriptions 
management philosophy railtex  through its process oriented performance based management approach and decentralized management structure  has developed a culture that encourages employees to take initiative and responsibility 
the company rewards productivity through its performance based  incentive compensation programs 
during the last three years  the company s employees received an average of of their base pay in incentive payments 
portfolio expansion since  the company has built a portfolio of railroads  almost all of which were added as a result of a competitive bidding process 
railtex has developed a disciplined approach for identifying  analyzing  negotiating and structuring additions to railtex s portfolio of short line railroads 
the company believes this approach  together with its ability to finance acquisitions quickly with borrowings under the company s million revolving us acquisition facility us acquisition facility and its cdn million revolving canadian acquisition facility canadian acquisition facility  has provided it with a competitive advantage 
at february   the company had million and cdn million available under the us acquisition facility and canadian acquisition facility  respectively 
the company has developed an acquisition team which is responsible for implementing the company s expansion program 
expansion opportunities are presented to the company by divesting carriers or are identified by the company through dialogues maintained by this acquisition team with major rail carriers and other railroad operators 
opportunities are evaluated according to company guidelines with respect to  among other matters  financial returns  size  revenue and operating synergies with existing properties  effect on geographic  commodity  connecting carrier and customer diversification 
members of the company s acquisition team  assisted by senior management  complete a thorough evaluation of each opportunity 
this evaluation includes in depth  on site investigations  reviews of historical traffic volumes  interviews with operating personnel and current and potential customers and conversations with local officials and members of the business community 
railtex adds short line railroad properties to its portfolio through purchase  lease or contract to operate 
typically  the company bids against other short line operators for available properties 
the timing and structure of each transaction is determined by the divesting railroad based upon strategic and economic considerations 
the primary factors considered by the divesting carrier are the price they will receive for the sale of a railroad property and the price per carload they will pay a new operator for interchanging traffic 
however  divesting carriers also consider a prospective operator s experience and its ability to close a transaction and commence operations in a timely manner 
following the closing of a transaction  railroad properties acquired by railtex are integrated into the company by go teams of railtex professionals 
these transition teams  headed by the company s regional general managers  are composed of experienced company employees assembled from throughout the railtex organization 
these teams implement railtex s policies and procedures at the newly added railroad properties and conduct interim operations until the new general managers of these railroads are able to hire and train a full time work force 
the company believes its approach to commencing operations on its properties benefits its customers by helping to eliminate the service delays and interruptions which often accompany transitions to new operators 
short line operations marketing following commencement of operations by railtex  the company s railroads generally have attracted increased rail shipments from existing customers and obtained traffic from new customers which had not previously shipped by rail or had ceased rail shipments 
the company believes its ability to generate additional traffic is accomplished by its marketing and customer service efforts which are aimed at identifying and responding quickly to the individual business needs of customers along its rail lines 
as part of these marketing efforts  the company often schedules more frequent rail service  helps customers negotiate price and service levels with connecting carriers and assists customers in obtaining the quantity and type of rail equipment required for their operations 
the company also often runs non scheduled trains on short notice to accommodate customers special or emergency needs 
the company assigns primary responsibility for price and service decisions affecting a railroad s customers to the general manager of each railroad  thereby providing such managers the ability to respond to the needs of the customer 
these railroad managers encourage their entire staff to participate in marketing efforts 
general managers and marketing personnel at each railroad are supported by senior marketing management at railtex s headquarters  who assist with sales calls  provide industrial development expertise  conduct formal marketing training and make coordinated sales calls on national accounts which have facilities on more than one company railroad 
in  the company served more than customers which shipped and received a wide variety of products 
railtex s ten largest customers accounted for of the company s operating revenues in the company s largest customer in was cn  representing of operating revenues as a result of bridge traffic with indiana and ohio railway iory  formerly the detroit  toledo and ironton 
assuming continuation of railtex s expansion strategy  management expects its reliance on any one customer  including cn  to diminish over time 
railtex believes its relationships with its customers are excellent 
management the company s three tiered decentralized management structure is an important element in its operating strategy 
first  significant operational autonomy and responsibility for operating financial results is given to local railroad management 
in addition  two regional managers provide supervision and coordination for railroads under their jurisdiction  while corporate headquarters has responsibility for centralized policy setting and strategic capital and financial planning  as well as accounting and other shared services 
also at headquarters  a group of experienced professionals provide additional expertise to all the company s railroads in certain technical fields including engineering  mechanical  information technology  and safety programs 
the company s management structure puts service oriented decision making close to the customer but also provides a centralized support system to ensure consistency and efficiency in more specialized or technical areas 
the company has implemented a performance based process management approach which relies upon key performance indicators or critical success factors csfs to manage performance against previously defined targets 
on a monthly basis  each manager conducts a formal review of performance against target for each csf  focusing on items that are not on target  identifying the root cause of the variance and formulating action plans for getting back on target 
the company believes its decentralized management structure  in conjunction with performance based process management  enables each railroad to tailor its operations to its customers needs and optimize performance 
each railtex railroad is managed by a general manager who has broad authority and responsibility for pricing  staffing  purchasing  marketing and operations 
general managers operate their railroads pursuant to business plans developed annually 
most of the company s general managers have been recruited from operating or marketing management at the major railroads and typically have several years of railroad industry experience 
each new general manager is provided an extensive orientation to the company s operating policies and procedures 
in addition  all general managers attend periodic staff meetings to exchange information with respect to operating  marketing and regulatory issues 
general managers also remain current on industry developments by  among other means  attending national and regional railroad conferences 
in addition to the general manager  the smaller railroad typically employs an operations manager  a marketing manager  a clerk and several transportation specialists 
the larger railroads typically employ one or more operations and marketing managers  several clerks  mechanical  maintenance of way and signal specialists  as well as several transportation specialists 
most major track and railcar repair and derailment work is contracted to outside specialists  however the larger railroads often perform some of these repairs inhouse 
work force flexibility with respect to work assignments is a key element of the company s operating strategy and contributes significantly to the operational productivity of the company s railroads 
all of the company s personnel are trained in a wide range of skills necessary for short line operations 
railroad operating employees can be assigned to tasks on an as needed basis because the company s railroads are not bound by traditional railroad industry craft and work distinctions pursuant to which railroad operating employees are assigned to tasks based upon narrowly defined job descriptions 
trains are typically operated by two person crews  consisting of transportation specialists who operate the locomotive and couple and uncouple railcars 
the company believes the organization of its railroads into relatively small work groups encourages greater team effort and permits more clearly defined responsibility and accountability than is obtainable by larger  more centrally managed railroads 
all but one of the company s short line railroads maintains a performance based  incentive compensation program through which a portion of a railroad s operating profits is distributed quarterly to its employees 
incentive compensation programs are administered by the general managers and distributions are made principally on the basis of individual performance 
a total of employees of four of the company s us railroads have elected to be represented by the united transportation union utu pursuant to governing national mediation board nmb procedures 
one railroad is involved in mediation with the utu over the terms of a collective bargaining agreement  one railroad has an active contract  and the two remaining railroads are in negotiation 
in each case all employees are represented by one union and there are no craft distinctions or work rule limitations 
in and  the utu sought to organize another of the company s railroads  however  on march   the employees elected to remain non union 
pursuant to the ontario labor relations act  employees of one of the company s canadian railroads have elected to be represented by the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble 
these employees did not seek to impose craft distinctions on this railroad  but sought certain compensation levels before an arbitration panel 
the arbitration panel ruled that the railroad s wage rates should be similar to wage rates paid to skilled unionized employees within the railroad s local economy 
the arbitration panel also ruled that these employees may no longer participate in the company s incentive compensation program 
because the union contracts negotiated provide for wage rates similar to the wage rates already in existence at the company s railroads and these railroads remain free of craft distinctions and onerous work rules  union representation of these employees of the company s total workforce as of february  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
at february   the company had approximately full time employees 
the company believes that its relations with its employees are good 
an active program of employee involvement was begun in late to further strengthen the relationship between the employees and the company 
safety an important component of the company s operating strategy is its emphasis on conducting safe railroad operations for the benefit and protection of employees  customers and the communities served by the company s railroads 
all general managers undergo a week long training course at the hazardous materials training center operated by the association of american railroads 
operations managers of railroads which transport hazardous materials also attend this course 
new transportation specialists attend intensive ten day training courses conducted by the company which cover all aspects of safe and appropriate locomotive and railcar handling 
in addition  transportation specialists  prior to receiving locomotive engineer certification  attend a special one week training course conducted by the company 
this basic training is supplemented at each railroad with field and classroom training and annual safety and rules tests  conducted by operating and safety training specialists who visit each railroad on a quarterly basis 
the company also conducts safety inspections on each of its railroads 
each employee involved in train operations is subject to pre employment and random drug testing  whether or not required by federal regulation 
in addition  personnel from each railroad conduct railroad highway crossing safety education programs at schools  driver education courses and service clubs in the communities they serve 
traffic rail traffic may be categorized as interline  local or bridge traffic 
interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers 
local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other rail carriers 
bridge traffic neither originates nor terminates on a rail carrier s line  but rather passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another 
traffic which originated or terminated on railtex s lines generated and of the company s total freight revenues in and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of significant automotive bridge traffic at iory which moves between detroit and cincinnati under a haulage agreement with cn 
the company believes that higher levels of interline and local traffic provide it with greater stability of revenues because such traffic represents shipments to or from customers located along its lines which  unlike bridge traffic  cannot easily be diverted to other rail carriers 
the following table summarizes freight revenues by type of traffic carried by the company s railroads in and  in dollars and as a percent of total freight revenues 
freight revenues dollars in thousands interline   local   bridge   total freight revenues   connecting carriers most of railtex s short line properties interchange traffic with multiple carriers 
at february   the company s railroads connected with railroads operated by other carriers 
of the company s rail lines  connect with two or more carriers 
the following table summarizes the company s significant connecting carriers in and by freight revenues and carloads as a percentage of total interchanged interline and bridge traffic 
interchanged traffic freight freight connecting carrier revenues carloads revenues carloads union pacific corporation canadian national railways csx transportation  inc consolidated rail corporation norfolk southern railway company burlington northern santa fe railway company all other railroads total interchanged traffic charges for interchanged traffic are generally billed to the customer by the connecting carrier and cover the entire transportation of a shipment from origin to destination  including the portion that travels over the company s lines 
the company s revenues from such traffic are generally collected through fees paid directly to the company by the connecting carriers rather than by customers on its lines  and are payable regardless of whether the connecting carriers are able to collect from the customers 
the fees payable by connecting carriers are set forth in contracts entered into by each of the company s railroads with their respective connecting carriers and are subject to periodic adjustments 
commodities railtex s railroads transport a wide variety of commodities for their customers 
some of the company s railroads have a well diversified commodity base  while other company railroads transport one or two dominant commodities 
by favoring portfolio additions whose commodity mix would further diversify the company s railroad portfolio  railtex seeks over the long term to limit its exposure to any single commodity to no more than of freight revenues 
in  lumber and forest products and coal  which contributed and  respectively  of freight revenues  were the two largest commodity groups transported by the company s railroads 
see table summarizing the company s freight revenues and traffic volume in and by commodity group at page the following is a description of the commodities transported by the company lumber and forest products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company transports finished lumber used in construction  as well as woodchips and pulpwood used in particle board and paper manufacturing 
the company serves paper mills and lumber producers in oregon  georgia  and nova scotia as well as lumber distribution facilities in new england 
coal for electric power generating plants represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company provides freight services for six large electric utilities located in indiana  missouri  arkansas and nova scotia  canada 
in indiana and nova scotia  the company transports unit coal trains from local coal mines to the utility s power plants 
the company transports unit trains of powder river basin coal to power plants in missouri and arkansas and unit trains of west virginia  indiana and nova scotia coal to co generation plants in virginia  indiana and nova scotia  respectively 
chemicals represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume  and consists primarily of chemicals used in the manufacturing of polyester fiber in south carolina 
chemicals also include liquid and bulk agricultural fertilizers and plastic pellets 
scrap paper and paper products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company serves paper mills that produce paper products in oregon and newsprint and paper in nova scotia 
the company also serves warehouses for paper and paper products in new england and south carolina manufacturing facilities that produce paper plates  cups and bowls and specialty paper products 
farm products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
farm products consist primarily of corn  wheat  peanuts and soybeans 
field crops produced in georgia  north carolina  kansas  missouri  michigan and texas account for the majority of this traffic  however  the company also transports unit trains of soybeans and grain to louisiana for export 
scrap metal and metal products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company serves a steel works in nova scotia that utilizes scrap metal to manufacture railroad rail and steel blooms 
the company also serves a steel mini mill in south carolina that utilizes scrap steel and a steel works in missouri that utilizes coiled steel for the manufacture of steel springs 
in connecticut  the company serves a plant that manufactures rolled copper coil wire from copper bundles and in ontario the company serves a steel mill 
food products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
food products consist primarily of vegetable oils  peanut meal  canned goods  lard and other products 
non metallic ores represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
non metallic ores consist primarily of limestone used in road construction in texas  virginia and georgia 
non metallic ores also include salt transported by the company from a large mine in ontario  canada and sand which is used in glass manufacturing and in foundries supporting the automotive industry 
autos and auto parts represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company moves significant automotive bridge traffic between detroit and cincinnati under a haulage agreement with cn 
petroleum products represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the majority of this traffic is liquefied petroleum gas produced in new mexico and texas which is destined for southern california and  ultimately  tijuana  mexico 
the company also serves a large petrochemical plant in louisiana which manufactures fuel additives 
minerals and stone represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
the company transports chemical lime used in the manufacturing of manganese  calcium carbonate  finished brick and cement 
railroad equipment represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
railroad equipment consists primarily of empty auto railcars transported for automobile manufacturers in michigan and new railcars manufactured in nova scotia 
other traffic volume represented of freight revenues and of traffic volume 
other traffic is primarily composed of machinery and fuel blending agents 
competition portfolio additions in the process of building its portfolio of short line railroads  railtex typically competes with other short line railroad operators and regional railroads 
competition for railroad properties is based primarily upon price  operating history and financing capability 
the current acquisition market is very competitive as capital is readily available to our competitors and the availability of new properties has slowed because of the mergers of the larger us railroads 
the company believes its established reputation as an acquirer and operator of short line rail properties  in combination with its managerial and financial resources  effectively positions it to be competitive on future strategic acquisitions 
railroad operations each of the company s railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving its customers  however  the company s railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  to a much lesser extent  barge operators 
the extent of this competition varies significantly among railtex s railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required  as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided  for an origin to destination transportation package 
cost reductions achieved by major rail carriers over the past several years have generally improved their ability to compete with truckload carriers 
since traffic on most of the company s railroads is interchanged with long haul rail lines  the company believes it benefits from the improving competitiveness of its connecting carriers 
insurance railtex maintains insurance to cover costs associated with personal injury  including death  and property damage  including derailments 
the company s liability policies  which include third party property damage  are currently subject to a self insured retention of  per occurrence 
with respect to its transportation of hazardous commodities  the company s liability policies cover sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and damage to property of shippers are also covered under the company s liability policies 
the company s property damage policies  which cover owned leased property  are currently subject to a self insured retention of  per occurrence 
the company s railroad employees are covered by the federal employers liability act fela  a fault based system under which injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation based on the comparative negligence of the employee and the employer 
fela related claims are covered under the company s liability insurance policies 
the company believes its insurance coverage is adequate in light of its experience and the experience of the rail industry 
however  the company can give no assurance as to the adequacy  availability or cost of insurance in the future 
regulation united states overview 
in addition to the environmental  safety  and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses  the company s railroad subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the surface transportation board stb  the successor to the interstate commerce commission icc  and the federal railroad administration fra and by regulatory agencies in the various states in which they do business 
the company believes its operations are in material compliance with these regulations 
additionally  the company is subject to stb regulation in its acquisition of new railroad properties by purchase  lease or contract to operate 
since  there has been a significant relaxation in regulations governing such transactions  and this change has favorably affected the company s ability to add railroad properties to its portfolio 
various interests in the united states have sought and continue to seek reimposition of government controls on the railroad industry in areas deregulated in whole or in part since  including stricter rate regulation and more onerous labor protection conditions for rail line transfers 
stb 
the icc termination act  which was enacted on december   eliminated the icc as an independent agency and created the stb  a new agency within the department of transportation which began functioning on january  the icc termination act made a number of changes which have altered the procedure and timing for federal approval of rail projects  including abandonments  line sales  mergers  rates and tariffs 
the icc termination act made significant changes in line sale procedures  particularly with respect to labor protection on class ii and iii acquisitions 
specifically  a class ii carrier that acquires a line must provide one year of severance pay to employees who lose their jobs as a result of the acquisition  less any railroad earnings the employee may receive from the acquiring carrier 
class iii carriers and non carriers are exempt from paying labor protection as a consequence of acquiring a line 
with respect to mergers  the stb is required to approve mergers of two or more class ii or class iii carriers 
employees adversely affected by a merger  involving at least one class ii and one or more class iii carriers  must receive one year of severance pay reduced by any railroad earnings the employee may receive from the acquiring carrier 
if the merger involves only class iii carriers  no labor protection may be imposed 
the icc termination act also simplified and streamlined the abandonment process 
with respect to rates and tariffs  railroads no longer have an obligation to file tariffs with the federal government 
however  in some instances  primarily for agricultural products  railroads must make those rates available to persons requesting them in writing 
fra 
the fra regulates railroad safety and equipment standards  including track maintenance and train speed standards  special procedures for handling hazardous shipments  locomotive and railcar inspection and repair requirements  operating practices and crew qualifications 
state regulatory agencies 
state regulatory agencies do not have authority to engage in economic regulation of railroads that are part of the interstate network 
state and local governments generally retain jurisdiction over local rail safety matters  such as the installation of grade crossings  grade crossing warning devices and safety inspectors 
canada overview 
the company s canadian railroad subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the various governmental departments or regulatory agencies in the provinces in which they do business 
the company believes its operations are in material compliance with provincial regulations  except for those which are obsolete and  therefore  not regularly enforced 
additionally  the company is subject to canadian transportation agency cta regulation with regard to the transfer of federally regulated railroad properties 
under the canada transportation act c  the sale of a federal rail line is not subject to federal approval  although a process of advertising and negotiations may be required 
in addition  a certificate of fitness  which is issued to a company which proposes to construct or operate a railway in canada  is required and is issued on proof of insurance 
federal 
a canadian railroad generally falls under federal regulation if its operations cross any borders between provinces  if it operates internationally or if parliament has declared it a federal work or undertaking 
the two major railroads of canada  cn and the canadian pacific railway company  are subject to cta regulation because they operate nationwide 
consequently  additions to the company s portfolio in canada will be subject to federal regulatory approval mainly certificates of fitness through the cta as well as investment canada pursuant to the investment canada act  the federal act in canada governing purchases of canadian businesses by non canadians 
provincial 
short lines which reside wholly within the boundaries of a particular province are governed almost exclusively by the laws of that province 
each of the ten provinces in canada has different laws with respect to regulation of railroads 
most of the provinces have drafted new legislation which is more favorable to the operation of short lines than previous provincial laws 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to various us and canadian federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  which have become increasingly stringent 
these environmental laws and regulations  which are implemented principally in the us by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies and principally in canada by provincial agencies  govern the management of hazardous wastes  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters  and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances 
the oregon department of environmental quality deq has filed an administrative action against one of the company s railroads for alleged violations of the clean water act by the disposal of landslide debris into a waterway 
the administrative action requires the railroad to cease and desist all further disposal of slide material and to develop a plan for the appropriate disposal of future material and subjects the company to a potential civil penalty of up to  per day of violation 
upon receipt of the administrative action the company filed an answer denying the charges and asserted various affirmative defenses to the violation and requested an informal conference to see if the matter could be resolved 
the representatives from the deq and the company met in november to discuss an informal resolution of the administrative proceedings and the deq agreed to dismiss the administrative enforcement actions if the company would develop  with the assistance of an appropriate environmental consultant  a landslide excavation and debris disposal plan 
a plan was prepared  with the assistance of an environmental consultant  which has been submitted to the deq 
the deq has not responded formally but the company believes it will be able to resolve the matter and have the administrative proceedings withdrawn 
in connection with the alleged clean water act violation discussed above  the environmental protection agency epa has commenced a criminal investigation 
in connection with the investigation  a subpoena was issued on october   requesting various documents from the company 
the company complied with the subpoena and there has been no additional action by the epa 
the company intends to vigorously defend its position but is unable to predict the outcome of this investigation 
other than the administrative action filed by the deq and the epa criminal investigation  there are no other material environmental claims pending or  to the company s knowledge at this time  threatened against the company 
the company also believes that its operations are in material compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the company estimates that any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current laws and regulations will not have any material effect on the company s earnings or capital expenditures 
however  the company can provide no assurance that the current regulatory requirements will not change or that currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or that past non compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the company s properties 
item properties the company  through its subsidiaries  operates over  miles of track in states in the us  two provinces in canada and baja  mexico 
the company has added railroad properties to its portfolio through purchase of track and roadbed  lease of such assets  contracts to operate properties under management agreements and purchase of railroad company common stock  depending upon the economic and strategic considerations of the divesting carriers 
of the properties the company has acquired to date  are owned  four are leased  four are partially owned and partially leased  two are operated under long term management agreements and one ceased operations in after acquiring the right to operate a railroad property  the company must arrange for the purchase or lease of operating equipment and hire the work force necessary to operate the property 
for properties which the company owns  the continuity of operations of purchased railroad properties has been limited to the physical transfer of these assets 
the company typically does not contractually assume any of the operations or liabilities of the divesting carriers 
quality of the company s title to its owned rights of way varies 
the company s properties were acquired by its predecessors over extended periods of time and by different companies 
accordingly  the original conveyancing documents were not standardized and are subject to judicial interpretation as to the interest conveyed to the original acquiring railroad 
in cases involving other railroads  deeds have sometimes been construed to create either an easement for railroad purposes or an ownership interest that terminated upon the cessation of use for railroad purposes 
if the company ceases to operate its railroad over a parcel  the company s interest in the parcel could revert to adjacent landowners or to others holding a reversionary interest 
under certain limited circumstances  two of the railroad properties may be repurchased by the original selling carriers for their original purchase prices 
in addition  the purchase price of one of the company s railroads is subject to reimbursement up to million if certain levels of carloadings are not achieved within a specified time period  as detailed in the purchase and sale agreement 
for properties it leases  the company ordinarily assumes upon the commencement date all operating and financial responsibilities including maintenance  payment of property taxes and regulatory compliance 
lease payments on three railroads leased from one major railroad are structured to ensure that the company interchanges an agreed upon percentage of outbound carloads with the lessor railroad 
under these leases  the company makes no payments as long as it interchanges a minimum percentage of its traffic with the lessor  therefore  the company controls the amount that may be payable under these leases 
these leases have an initial year term with one or more renewal terms at the company s option 
in addition  lease payments on five properties leased from two other major railroads are subject to reduction from the base rate  down to zero  depending upon the level of traffic interchanged with the lessors 
the maximum aggregate annual base rate lease payments under these leases is approximately million 
these leases have initial lease terms of five years to years and include purchase options which may be exercised by the company after one to three years of operation 
no payments have been required under any of the company s railroad property leases  and the company anticipates that its traffic interchange for the foreseeable future will not result in any payments being incurred under any railroad property leases 
generally  upon the termination of a lease  the company does not have a right to the return of any capital investment made in its property leased 
rail properties operated by the company under management agreements typically have initial ten year terms followed by either a purchase option or one or more renewal terms at the company s option 
these operating contracts typically require that the company assume all operating and financial responsibilities for freight operations on the property including maintenance  payment of property taxes and regulatory compliance 
payments by railtex for the right to conduct rail operations on these properties are typically calculated as percentages of its revenues from the respective properties 
generally  as in the case of leases  upon termination of these agreements the company does not have a right to the return of any capital investment made in the property managed 
railroad properties owned  leased or operated under contract by the company s subsidiaries typically consist of the track  ties and underlying land 
real estate adjacent to the railroad rights of way is generally retained by the seller  and the company s holdings of such property is not significant 
similarly  the seller typically retains mineral rights and fiber optics easements in the properties acquired by the company 
revenues derived by the company from various rentals and easements totaled approximately million in in order to improve its overall profitability and financial returns  the company has performed an analysis of its portfolio railroad properties with the objective of identifying those properties which do not meet the company s overall financial objectives and which do not offer significant revenue or operating expansion opportunities 
the company is currently pursuing its alternatives with respect to these properties  which may include possible sale of the railroad property

track railtex conducted its freight operations on  miles of track as of february   including  miles of owned track  miles of leased track  and miles of track operated under long term operating contracts 
in addition  the company operated on miles of track owned by other railroads pursuant to trackage rights agreements 
because of the relatively short length of the typical railtex railroad and the stop and start nature of its switching activity  the majority of the company s freight operations are conducted at speeds of miles per hour or less 
of the track operated by railtex  was rated fra class ii or higher and was rated fra class i or lower at february  the remaining was located in mexico or canada and not subject to fra inspection and regulation 
track condition fra class v iv iii ii i excepted other total owned   leased contract trackage rights total miles   fra track class as percentage of miles maximum speed in mph n a includes trackage rights associated with owned or leased railroad properties 
the company s track maintenance strategy is to maintain its track  ties  roadbed and structures consistent with safe operations and with the volume of traffic transported over its lines 
the company believes its capital expenditure requirements for track maintenance are lower than those incurred by the major rail carriers which previously operated most of the company s railroad properties because such major rail carriers generally operated at higher speeds over this track and  therefore  required greater levels of track maintenance 
also  the labor costs incurred by major railroads for track maintenance are typically higher than the company s labor costs 
safety related maintenance needs receive the company s highest maintenance priority  followed by high density track segments on which the highest volume of traffic is transported 
low density segments  sidings  and lines for which higher transit speeds are not essential to providing timely and effective customer service are maintained at lower fra class conditions 
track maintenance is performed by each railroad s operating personnel with local track contractors supplementing this effort on an as needed basis 
in connection with the lease of one of its railroad properties  the company has committed to upgrade approximately miles  net of abandonments  of track to class ii standards by october  however  the company is negotiating with the lessor to extend this period

of the locomotives owned by railtex  most have been rebuilt  updated or overhauled 
calculating locomotive age from the date of rebuild  the company s locomotives have an average age of years 
the company s availability rate with respect to its locomotive fleet was in freight cars per diem sharing type owned leased arrangements total hopper cars flat cars gondola cars box cars   total   the company has entered into per diem sharing arrangements covering  cars as of february  under these arrangements  the company agrees to place the freight cars on its railroads for prospective loading by customers and  in exchange  the company does not incur rent on these cars when these cars are on one of its railroads 
in addition  car owners pay the company a portion of the rents earned when the freight cars are on railroads other than the company s

forward looking statements this section contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcome and results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
general the company s growth to date has resulted primarily from implementation of its expansion strategy 
the number of miles of track operated by railtex has grown to more than  at december  the company has added railroad properties to its portfolio primarily through purchase of track and roadbed  lease of such assets  contracts to operate such assets under management agreements and purchase of railroad company common stock 
these arrangements typically relate only to the physical assets of the railroad property  and except for the purchase of the indiana ohio rail corp 
inoh  the company typically does not contractually assume any of the operations or liabilities of the divesting carriers 
after acquiring the right to operate each of its railroad properties  the company must arrange for the purchase or lease of operating equipment and hire the workforce necessary to operate the railroad 
accordingly  for any railroad property  the historical results of operations of the railroad property as previously operated are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the property following commencement of operations by the company 
because of variations in the structure  timing and size of portfolio additions and differences in economics among the company s portfolio railroads resulting from the unique terms  rates and other provisions for each railroad s operation established through negotiation between railtex and each divesting carrier  the company s results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to i its results of operations in other reporting periods or ii the results of operations of other railroad companies 
therefore  care should be taken when using traditional measurements of railroad operating performance  such as freight revenues per carload  operating ratio and labor ratio  in assessing or comparing the company s operating results 
comparable railroad properties for each period are railroad properties which the company operated throughout both the full current year and the full prior year 
new railroad properties for each period are railroad properties which the company began operating after the start of the prior year 
for  new railroad properties include the inoh  the connecticut southern railroad csor  the ontario l orignal railway  inc olor  the pittsburgh industrial railroad  inc pirr and the detroit  toledo and ironton dti 
recent developments the company has been impacted by the congestion the union pacific railroad up is experiencing primarily through car supply issues and increased operating expenses due to overtime associated with running trains on unscheduled days and delays caused by waiting for access to up yards 
additionally  revenues have been lost to other modes of transportation as customers avoid the service problems caused by the up congestion 
at this time  the company is unable to estimate the total impact of these issues on its results of operations 
to the extent that the up problems continue or worsen  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
during  certain asian countries experienced a financial crisis resulting in the devaluation of their currencies 
the asian crisis increased speculation that the brazilian currency real would be devalued 
in response to the asian crisis  the brazilian government invoked certain fiscal measures  including raising the domestic interest rate in brazil  in an effort to stabilize the real 
although the real continues to gradually decline relative to the us dollar  the government s measures averted a significant devaluation of the real 
however  there can be no assurances that these measures will prevent future currency devaluations 
in addition  it is generally believed that the increase in domestic interest rates may slow economic growth in brazil  which could impact the growth potential for the ferrovia centro atlantica  sa fca and ferrovia sul atlantico  sa fsa 
additionally  the economic uncertainty related to brazil has impacted the ability of fca and fsa to finance short term capital needs 
to the extent that this situation continues and the fca or the fsa is unable to externally finance working capital or vital capital expenditures  the respective board of directors of fca and fsa may implement a call for additional capital contributions from the existing shareholders 
while the company is not obligated to contribute additional capital  in the event the company does not participate in the capital call  its equity percentage could be diluted 
as a result of the gradual decline in the real since the time the company originally invested in fca and fsa  the company recorded a charge of million against its investments in fca and fsa in the company believes it will be able to recoup the carrying value of its investments in fca and fsa  which totaled million as of december   however  dependent upon the ultimate outcome of the events and conditions discussed above  the financial condition of the company could be adversely affected 
as a result of the acquisition of consolidated rail corporation conrail by csx transportation  inc csx and norfolk southern railway company ns  conrail s rail lines will be divided between csx and ns which may cause revenue to be diverted from the new england central railroad  inc necr and the indiana southern railroad  inc isrr  wholly owned subsidiaries of railtex  inc filings made by csx and ns with the surface transportation board stb indicated that traffic with revenues of approximately million will be diverted from the necr 
necr estimates that traffic with revenues of as much as million and the isrr estimates that traffic with revenues of million could be diverted on an annual basis 
in addition  the inoh  a wholly owned subsidiary of railtex  inc  believes the division of rail lines between csx and ns will cause operating inefficiencies for inoh 
as a result  necr  isrr and inoh have filed requests with the stb for limited trackage rights to remedy the potential loss of revenue and rectify operating inefficiencies 
the company is unable to predict the final outcome of these filings at this time 
in order to improve its overall profitability and financial returns  the company has performed an analysis of its portfolio railroad properties with the objective of identifying those properties which do not meet the company s overall financial objectives and which do not offer significant revenue or operating expansion opportunities 
the company is currently pursuing its alternatives with respect to these properties  which may include possible sale of the railroad property
