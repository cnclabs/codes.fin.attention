market sensitive instruments and risk management carpenter uses derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk 
raw material cost fluctuations for metals businesses are normally offset by selling price adjustments primarily through the use of surcharge mechanisms 
firm price sales contracts involve a risk of profit margin decline in the event of raw material increases 
carpenter reduces this risk by entering into commodity futures and commodity price swaps which are effective hedges of the risk 
fluctuations in foreign exchange subject carpenter to risk of losses on anticipated future cash flows from its foreign operations 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge this foreign exchange risk 
these hedging strategies are reviewed and approved by management before being implemented 
management has established policies regarding the use of derivative instruments which prohibit the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives 
monthly market valuations are performed to monitor the effectiveness of carpenter s risk management programs 
the status of carpenter s financial instruments as of june   is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming a an instantaneous percent decrease in the price of raw materials for which carpenter has commodity futures and swaps  b a percent strengthening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies for which foreign exchange forward contracts existed  and c a percent change in interest rates on carpenter s short term debt had all occurred on june   carpenter s results of operations  cash flow and financial position would not have been materially affected

neither the exact amount of cleanup costs nor the final method of their allocation among all designated prps at these superfund sites has been determined 
carpenter accrues amounts for environmental remediation costs that represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs related to environmental remediation 
the liability recorded for environmental cleanup costs at june  was million 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible costs of remediation at carpenter owned operating facilities and the superfund sites is between million and million as of june  recoveries of expenditures are recognized as receivables when they are estimable and probable 
the remaining discounted amount receivable for recoveries at june  was million 
additional details are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements

year issues carpenter  its suppliers and customers are heavily reliant upon computer systems for many aspects of their businesses 
the calendar year will make many current computerized systems ineffective and will require corrections or replacements before january  this situation year issues could have a material adverse effect upon carpenter if not adequately remedied by carpenter  its suppliers and customers on a timely basis 
the following describes carpenter s status regarding these issues 
carpenter s state of readiness carpenter has been formally addressing its year issues during the past several fiscal years 
these efforts involve assessments  conversion plans and conversion implementation and testing for all internal systems running on a variety of computing platforms ranging from mainframe to programmable logic controllers 
all mainframe based computer systems have been assessed  plans have been put into place and required conversion of computer programs is approximately percent complete 
converted programs have been tested and placed into operation 
full conversion is expected to be completed by december the non mainframe based applications consist of over individually identified projects throughout carpenter 
assessments have been completed and conversion plans have been developed for more than half of these projects 
completion of conversion plans is expected by december  with testing and implementation scheduled by july in summary  carpenter believes that its internal systems will be year compliant in all material respects by december in addition to these efforts regarding internal systems  carpenter has begun assessing the state of readiness of its major suppliers 
surveys have been sent to all significant suppliers of materials and services to carpenter s operations to determine their preparedness for the year these suppliers include raw material  energy and production supply providers as well as suppliers of financial  communication and logistics services 
responses have been received from approximately half of these suppliers with no major potential problems identified 
carpenter plans to continue this communication effort and to expand it to include on site reviews of large  critical suppliers 
this effort is expected to be completed by december carpenter has a very large  diverse customer base with more than  customers 
no customer represents more than percent of carpenter s sales 
carpenter has not yet begun an assessment and evaluation of the state of readiness of its customers  although many customers have requested from carpenter information regarding its year issues 
major customers will be contacted within the next year to determine if any significant loss of business is to be expected because of their inability to correct their year issues on a timely basis

as a result of these efforts  no major systems projects have been deferred to future periods 
b costs to replace non year compliant systems 
risks of year issues and contingency plans as stated above  carpenter expects that its systems will be fully operational and will not cause any material disruptions because of year issues 
because of the uncertainties associated with assessing preparedness of suppliers and customers  there is a risk of a material adverse effect on carpenter s future results of operations if these constituencies are not capable of correcting their year issues  if any 
carpenter plans  as outlined above  to continue assessing these risks through reviews with suppliers and customers 
contingency plans will be developed to deal with any problems which may become known as a result of these reviews 
contingency plans relating to suppliers  if necessary  will be developed by july such plans relating to customers will be developed by december forward looking statements this form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current expectations regarding future events that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those of such forward looking statements
