item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the primary factors affecting premier financial bancorp  inc s the company or premier performance and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts and per share data have been restated to give the effect of acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all dollar amounts except per share data are presented in thousands unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s rapid growth  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
overview in  premier continued to pursue its strategic plan to build a network of independently managed community banks into a strongly capitalized  risk controlled bank holding company with high quality earnings and shareholder liquidity 
premier continued to post record results in three key financial areas earnings  total assets and shareholders equity 
for  net income rose to  from  as restated  in  total assets increased to  from the  reported in  and shareholders equity increased to  from the  reported in during  a number of larger financial institutions announced plans to divest of branches 
in order to take advantage of these potential opportunities and to provide additional capital for other expansion opportunities  premier issued million of capital securities of subsidiary trust capital securities in june 
a portion of these funds were used in december in connection with the purchase of two branches with million in deposits and the balance will be used to complete the acquisition of three branches with total deposits of million expected to be completed in june in the third and fourth quarters of  premier invested the proceeds of the capital securities in temporary investments realizing gross investment gains of million which were added to earnings 
at year end  premier had tier i capital totaling million which will provide sufficient capital to complete the proposed acquisitions as well as additional acquisitions which may become available 
highlights of premier s performance and financial condition include return on average assets of return on average equity of net interest margin efficiency ratio allowance for loan losses to non performing loans acquisitions premier s acquisition philosophy is to seek community bank candidates in primarily non urban areas that can become a part of premier on a non dilutive basis within a two year timeframe 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  premier conducts a due diligence review to determine both risks and earnings potential 
desirable candidates have an established base of community involvement  strong local directors  a history of earnings and readily identifiable asset risks 
acquisition transactions are structured to make a fair return on investment while meeting the needs of the shareholders of banks joining premier 
in  premier completed one acquisition and also acquired the deposits and banking facilities of two branches 
on november    premier acquired the sabina bank  sabina  ohio  in a share exchange accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on december   two branch offices of the fifth third bank of western ohio located in waynesfield and ada  ohio  were acquired for cash and accounted for as a purchase 
also in  premier announced its intention to acquire ohio river bank  ironton  ohio  in the first quarter of  in a business combination anticipated to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and also announced its planned purchase of three branch offices of banc one corporation located in madison  phillippi and van  west virginia  expected to be completed in the second quarter of in  premier completed one acquisition 
on july   farmers deposit bancorp of eminence  kentucky  and its wholly owned subsidiary  farmers deposit bank  were acquired in a cash transaction that was accounted for as a purchase 
in  premier completed two acquisitions 
on march   the company acquired georgetown bancorp  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  georgetown bank trust  georgetown  kentucky  in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on october   premier acquired all of the outstanding shares of citizens bank of sharpsburg  kentucky  for cash 
this combination was accounted for as a purchase 
the significant financial data relative to these acquisitions is set forth in note to the financial statements 
capital securities of subsidiary trust on june   premier completed its public offering of million of mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust capital securities 
these securities qualify as tier i capital up to an amount not to exceed of tier i capital and the portion that exceeds the limitation qualifies as tier capital 
the issuance of these securities and resultant increase in capital has allowed the company to pursue larger financial institutions as potential acquisitions and to bid for branches offered for sale by other financial institutions

loans made to businesses and individuals are the primary interest earning assets  followed by investment securities and federal funds sold in the inter bank market 
deposits are the primary interest bearing liabilities used to support the interest earning assets 
the level of net interest income is affected by both the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the changes in their corresponding yields and costs  by the volume of interest earning assets funded by noninterest bearing deposits  and the level of capital 
premier s long term objective is to manage this income to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate  credit and liquidity risks 
nontaxable income from loans and investment securities is presented on a tax equivalent basis whereby income exempt from tax has been adjusted upward by an amount equivalent to the prevailing federal income taxes that would have been paid if the income had been fully taxable 
the discussion of factors influencing net interest income that follows is based on taxable equivalent data 
in each of the three years  this adjustment is based on an assumed federal income tax rate of

in  tax equivalent net interest income increased to  from  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to an increase of  or in average earning assets and an increase of  or in average interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets in of was basis points lower than the earned in while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from in to in consequently  premier s net interest spread decreased from in to in and the net interest margin decreased from in to in the decrease in net interest spread and net interest margin is primarily attributable to the issuance of million of mandatorily redeemable capital securities capital securities at an interest rate of and the company s implementation of an arbitrage investment strategy as described below 
in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on net income until a permanent investment can be made of the funds from the issuance of the capital securities  the company initiated an investment strategy at the end of the second quarter of of selling approximately million of short term days repurchase agreements and investing the proceeds in to year us treasury and agency securities with a weighted average interest rate of approximately higher than the weighted average rate paid on the repurchase agreements 
the company s policy is to unwind its position whenever the spread between the weighted average interest rate of the repurchase agreements and the weighted average rate on the underlying securities falls below basis points 
during the third quarter of and again during the fourth quarter of  the spread fell below basis points  the company unwound its positions and recognized net gains of million on the sale of the underlying securities in the arbitrage portfolio 
although the company s investment strategy to minimize the adverse impact on net income has been successful  the company s net interest spread and net interest margin have been significantly reduced by its implementation 
excluding the effects of the capital securities and the company s investment strategy  net interest spread would have been in compared to in and net interest margin would have been in versus the achieved in the net interest spread declined basis points from in to in  while the net interest margin  which measure net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  increased from in to in the increase in net interest margin is attributable to the higher levels of noninterest bearing deposits and capital supporting interest earning assets which rose from in to in the following table presents average balances and interest rates for the three year period ended december  average consolidated balance sheets and net interest analysis dollars in thousands

the allowance is increased by the provision for possible loan losses as well as recoveries of previously charged off loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
the provision is the necessary charge to expense to provide for current loan losses and to maintain the allowance at an adequate level commensurate with management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
various factors are taken into consideration when the company determines the amount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance 
some of the factors include past due and nonperforming assets  specific internal analyses of loans requiring special attention  the current level of regulatory classified and criticized assets and the associated risk factors with each  examinations and reviews by the company s independent accountants and internal loan review personnel  and examinations of the loan portfolio by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the data collected from these sources is evaluated with regard to current national and local economic trends  prior loss history  underlying collateral values  credit concentrations  and industry risks 
an estimate of potential future loss on specific loans is developed in conjunction with an overall risk evaluation of the total loan portfolio

an allocation for the allowance for possible loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance that will be used to cover future charge offs in each major loan category  but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan being used to absorb losses of another loan type

the company continues to develop and enhance existing products and to create new products in order to augment fee income as trends in the financial services industry and the economic environment continue to put pressure on the company s ability to increase its net interest income 
noninterest income includes deposit service charges  fees from data processing and trust services  fees and commissions from many other corporate and retail products and gains and losses from the sale of investment securities 
the discussion that follows considers the impact for comparative purposes of the acquisition of farmers deposit bancorp farmers deposit on july  since the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  only amounts from that date through december  are included in the consolidated financial statements for  whereas the consolidated financial statements include farmers deposit for the full year

financial condition lending activities loans are the company s primary use of financial resources and represent the largest component of earning assets 
the company s loans are made predominantly within the banks market areas and the portfolio is diversified 
credit risk is inherent in each financial institution s loan and investment portfolio 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  the company utilizes a credit administration network  including specific lending authorities for each loan officer  a system of loan committees to review and approve loans  and a loan review and credit quality rating system 
this network assists in the evaluation of the quality of new loans and in the identification of problem or potential problem credits and provides information to aid management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses

the company s real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in a bank s defined market area who are known to the bank s staff 
consumer loans are made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

all loans considered impaired under sfas are included in nonperforming loans 
the company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans that become days past due as to principal or interest unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
a loan remains in a nonaccrual status until doubts concerning the collectibility no longer exist 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the loan under the original terms 
other real estate is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell

interest income on non accrual and restructured loans year ended december dollars in thousands contractual interest interest recognized investment activities the securities portfolio consists of debt and equity securities which provide the company with a relatively stable source of income 
additionally  the investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and credit risks in other categories of the balance sheet 
the securities portfolio is also used as a secondary source of liquidity by the company 
the company has classified all municipal securities and certain u 
s 
treasury and agency securities as held to maturity based on management s positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity 
these municipal securities provide tax free income and are within management s guidelines with respect to credit risk and market risk 
the municipal securities have been issued principally by kentucky municipalities 
the u 
s 
treasury and agency securities are held as a source of stable  long term income which can be used as collateral to secure municipal deposits and repurchase agreements 
all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the securities portfolio does not contain significant holdings in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations or other mortgage related derivative products and or structured notes 
securities  exclusive of the arbitrage portfolio  as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased to in versus in and in 
these decreases in securities reflect management s emphasis on originating higher yielding loans and placing a lesser reliance on the securities portfolio for sources of income

deposit activities managing the mix and repricing of deposit liabilities is an important aspect of the company s ability to maximize its net interest margin 
the strategies used to manage interest bearing deposit liabilities are designed to adjust as the interest rate environment changes 
in this regard  management of the company regularly assesses its funding needs  deposit pricing  and interest rate outlooks 
total deposits averaged  in  a increase over total deposits averaged  in  an increase of  or over noninterest bearing deposits averaged of total deposits in  compared to in and in at december   deposits totaled  compared to  at december   an increase of  or

the fair value adjustment of the company s available for sale securities portfolio  which is recorded as a component of stockholders equity  may change significantly as market conditions change 
at december  and  the adjustment resulted in a reduction of stockholders equity of and  respectively 
further volatility in stockholders equity may occur in the future as market conditions change 
the company s principal source of funds for dividend payments to stockholders is dividends received from the subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirement limitations 
during  the banks could  without prior approval  declare dividends to the company of approximately  plus any net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration 
the various regulatory agencies having supervisory authority over financial institutions have adopted risk based capital guidelines which define the adequacy of the capital levels of regulated institutions 
these risk based capital guidelines require minimum levels of capital based upon the risk rating of assets and certain off balance sheet items 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned regulatory risk weights ranging from to depending on their level of credit risk 
the guidelines classify capital in two tiers  tier i and tier  the sum of which is total capital 
tier i capital is essentially common equity  less intangible assets 
tier capital is essentially qualifying long term debt and a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses 
during  the company completed its public offering of million of mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust 
these securities qualify as tier i capital up to an amount not to exceed of tier i capital and the portion that exceeds the limitation qualifies as tier capital 
consequently  the company s capital ratios as of december  increased significantly over the ratios at december  as noted in the following table selected capital information dollars in thousands december change stockholders equity    qualifying capital securities of subsidiary trust   disallowed amounts of goodwill and other intangibles    unrealized loss on securities available for sale tier i capital    december change tier ii capital adjustments qualifying capital securities of subsidiary trust   allowance for loan losses   total capital    total risk weighted assets   ratios tier i capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets leverage at year end the company believes that its capital  together with existing credit facilities and its ability to obtain future credit facilities  provides funds sufficient to support the company s current operations 
liquidity liquidity for a financial institution can be expressed in terms of maintaining sufficient cash flows to meet both existing and unplanned obligations in a cost effective manner 
adequate liquidity allows the company to meet the demands of both the borrower and the depositor on a timely basis  as well as pursuing other business opportunities as they arise 
thus  liquidity management embodies both an asset and liability aspect 
liquidity is maintained through the company s ability to convert assets into cash  manage the maturities of liabilities and generate funds through the attraction of local deposits 
as part of its liquidity management  the company maintains funding relationships with the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions  including a million revolving line of credit available for both general corporate purposes and future acquisitions 
the company prefers to manage its liquidity requirements generally through the matching of maturities of assets and liabilities 
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented in the financial statements provide an indication of the company s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
liquidity risk is the possibility that the company may not be able to meet its cash requirements 
management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and meet the needs of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
liquidity must be maintained at a level which is adequate but not excessive 
excess liquidity has a negative impact on earnings resulting from the lower yields on short term assets 
in addition to cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold  the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity 
the total of securities maturing within one year along with cash  due from banks and federal funds sold totaled million as of december  additionally  securities available for sale with maturities greater than one year and equity securities totaled million at december  these securities represent a secondary source available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
to maintain a desired level of liquidity  the company has several sources of funds available 
one is the cash flow generated daily from the banks various loan portfolios in the form of principal and interest payments 
another source is its deposit base 
the company maintains a relatively stable base of customer deposits which has historically exhibited steady growth 
this growth  when combined with other sources  is expected to be adequate to meet its demand for funds 
due to the nature of the markets served by the company s subsidiary banks  management believes that the majority of certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during a period of relatively stable interest rates  these balances as a percentage of total deposits have remained relatively the same for and certificates of deposits and other time deposits of  or more represented approximately and of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
a number of techniques are used to measure the liquidity position  including the utilization of several ratios that are presented below 
these ratios are calculated based on annual averages for each year 
liquidity ratios total loans total deposits total loans total deposits less float net short term borrowings total assets 
this analysis shows that the company s loan to deposit ratios increased in and compared to the prior year due to an increase in loan demand that exceeded the increase in deposit activity 
information regarding short term borrowings for the past three years is presented in the following table 
short term borrowings dollars in thousands federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements balance at year end   weighted average rate at year end average balance during the year   weighted average rate during the year maximum month end balance    other short term borrowings balance at year end   weighted average rate at year end average balance during the year   weighted average rate during the year maximum month end balance   total short term borrowings balance at year end    weighted average rate at year end average balance during the year    weighted average rate during the year maximum month end balance    substantially all federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements mature in one business day 
other short term borrowings principally represent federal home loan bank fhlb advances to georgetown bank with varying maturity dates  which are funding residential mortgage and commercial loans 
interest rate sensitivity the interest spread and liability funding discussed above are directly related to changes in asset and liability mixes  volumes  maturities and repricing opportunities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those which are subject to being repriced in the near term  including both floating or adjustable rate instruments and instruments approaching maturity 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest sensitive assets and total interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rates on the company s various asset and liability categories do not respond uniformly to changing market conditions 
interest rate risk is the degree to which interest rate fluctuations in the marketplace can affect net interest income 
the need for interest sensitivity gap management is most critical in times of a significant change in overall interest rates 
management generally seeks to limit the exposure of the company to interest rate fluctuations by maintaining a relatively balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a one year time horizon 
this mix is altered periodically depending upon management s assessment of current business conditions and the interest rate outlook 
one tool which is used to monitor interest rate risk is the interest sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below 
this analysis reflects the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the gap indicates the level of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing over a given time period 
as shown by the interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   the cumulative amount of the company s interest earning assets repricing during the first year is higher than the total amount of its interest bearing liabilities repricing during this period 
this position  which is normally termed a positive interest sensitivity gap  generally allows for enhanced net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
this positive gap is within the company s internal policy guidelines and is not expected to impact significantly the company s net interest income during a period of declining interest rates

premier s market risk is composed almost exclusively with interest rate risk 
this exposure is managed primarily through the strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since premier s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap analysis premier uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest spread rate spread 
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earnings assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would negatively affect net interest income 
it is management s goal to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
earnings simulation modeling the earnings simulation model forecasts net interest income under different scenarios that incorporate changes in the level of interest rates and their relationships with each other 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would decrease by approximately of stable rate net interest income if rates fall by two percentage points over the next year 
it projects an increase of if the rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a slight asset sensitive rate risk position for the one year horizon 
within the same time frame  but assuming an additional one percentage point move in rates  the model forecasts that net interest income would fall below that earned in a stable rate environment by in a falling rate scenario and increase by in a rising rate scenario 
this simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time 
loan prepayments are developed from industry median estimates for prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit pricing and sensitivity are assumed to follow historical patterns 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point increase in rates is estimated to reduce npv by 
additionally  npv is projected to decrease by if rates fall by basis points 
the calculations of present value have certain shortcomings 
the discount rates utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in this calculation  and therefore  would likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates utilized for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which are not necessarily indicative of the present value of deposits and fhlb advances since such deposits and advances are unique to  and have certain price and customer relationship advantages for  depository institutions 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier designed to further mitigate the effect on the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s net assets from any change in interest rates

stable rate interest rate risk management premier s strategy of investing primarily in loans and securities permits it to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
managing this exposure involves significant assumptions about the relationship of various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments 
prepayments on loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates making fixed rate loans more desirable 
investment securities  other than those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties which discourage customer withdrawal  while term federal home loan bank advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage prepayment prior to maturity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant interest rate increase 
the previous table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on premier s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities are subject to competitive and other pressures beyond our control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes 
management expects interest rates to be relatively stable during and believes that the current modest level of asset sensitivity is appropriate 
trade risk management premier does not maintain a trading account which would primarily provide investment products and risk management services to its customers as well as to take propriety risk positions 
derivative instruments a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
premier currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps or options 
however  the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit  which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate in excess of amounts recognized on the balance sheets 
commitments to make loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any contract condition 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral if deemed necessary 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by premier to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specific terms and conditions 
commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the company until the instrument is exercised 
other year premier initiated the process of preparing its computer systems and applications for the year during this process involves assessing  then modifying or replacing certain hardware and software maintained by the company as well as communicating with external service providers to ensure that they are taking the appropriate action to remedy their year issues 
management intends to have substantially all of the system and application changes completed by the end of and anticipates the estimated cumulative costs of compliance will not be material to the company s financial statements
