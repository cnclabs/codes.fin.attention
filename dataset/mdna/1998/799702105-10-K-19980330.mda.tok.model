the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview the company designs  develops  markets  implements and supports comprehensive banking software  called profile  for financial services organizations worldwide 
sanchez s highly flexible profile family of products is comprised of three integrated modules which operate on open  client server platforms 
the primary module  called profile anyware  is a multi currency transaction processing system which supports deposit  loan  customer and bank management requirements through multiple distribution channels  including the internet 
the other modules are profile fms  a multi company  multi currency  financial management and accounting system and profile for windows pfw  a graphical user interface for profile anyware 
the profile system is currently licensed to clients in countries serving in excess of financial institutions 
the company derives its revenues from license fees  recurring maintenance fees and professional services fees related to its software products 
license and service fees are paid in stages upon the completion by the company of certain defined deliverables 
the company recognizes revenue from these fees using the percentage of completion contract accounting method 
typically  the client implementation projects to which these fees relate have a to month duration 
recurring maintenance fees are normally billed annually in advance and recognized into revenue ratably over the period covered 
the company posted the strongest operating results in its history for the year ended december  during  contracts  valued at more than million  were executed with banking organizations in seven countries 
revenues for increased by to million compared to million in  reflecting increased demand for the company s products and services  particularly in the united states and canada 
net income for the year ended december   increased to million  or 
per diluted share  compared to million  or 
per diluted share  in  an increase of in earnings per share 
the company s backlog at december  amounted to million 
the components of the backlog were million for software license  product enhancement and implementation and consulting revenues and million for maintenance and support 
the company anticipates recognizing approximately million of this backlog in at december   the company s backlog amounted to million  consisting of million for software license  product enhancement and implementation and consulting revenues and million for maintenance and support 
historically  the company s revenues were dependent upon opportunities developed by its first hardware manufacturing partner  digital  and by the company s direct marketing efforts 
since the beginning of  the company has established marketing agreements with ibm  hewlett packard  oracle  price waterhouse and most recently  via a joint venture agreement  with elba csb sa  poland s largest bank technology services firm 
although substantially all of the company s revenues prior to have been generated in conjunction with systems running on digital platforms  the company completed its first project on an ibm platform in  and also expects to complete its first installation on a hewlett packard platform during the company intends to continue to work with all of its various partners to identify future opportunities 
in addition  the company has been investing additional resources to enhance its own direct sales and marketing efforts 
the company made a strategic decision in early to increase its investment in technology and product development  in particular as it relates to profile anyware  as well as certain other projects such as the development of its pfw graphical user interface client and the completion of the adaptation  or porting  of the company s software to operate on different hardware platforms 
as a direct result of these investments  the company currently has two clients in live operation on unix platforms one ibm based  the other digital based  and is actively working toward an initial conversion for its first pfw client in the company has continued increasing its investment in these areas and  as indicated below  product development expenditures increased significantly on a dollar basis in both and further  the company continues to increase its investment in sales and marketing activities 
in addition to its continuing efforts in the emerging bank market  direct bank market  and canadian credit union market  the company initiated certain sales and marketing efforts during geared toward the top tier banking market  defined as the  largest global and regional banks in the world 
the company has concluded that the flexible and integrated architecture of its profile anyware product makes it an excellent fit for international financial institutions seeking a single core processing system which can be utilized worldwide vs 
supporting different systems in each marketplace 
also  the market for direct bank products is frequently a sub component of the larger top tier bank market 
the company believes that its business is generally not seasonal  however  the company has historically experienced  and can be expected to continue to experience  a certain degree of variability in its quarterly revenue and earnings patterns 
this variability is typically driven by significant events which directly impact the recognition of project related revenues 
examples of such events include the timing of new business contract closings and the initiation of license and service fee revenue recognition  one time payments from existing clients relative to license expansion rights required to process a greater number of customer accounts or expand the number of permitted users  and completion of a significant implementation project roll out and the related revenue recognition 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of the project  length of contract negotiations and general economic conditions in a particular sales prospect s country of origin 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client projects  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
accordingly  the company has been actively evaluating the impact of the year on both its profile product line as well as its internal systems and hardware 
relative to the profile product line  all versions of profile sold and installed since late are believed to be year compliant 
further  due to system retrofits performed for the company s canadian credit union clients during and early  the company believes that these systems are also year compliant 
the cost to the company of the canadian version retrofits was approximately  all other clients using software installed prior to late are entitled to receive upgraded year compliant software as part of their software support agreements with the company  and they have been encouraged to upgrade 
to the extent the company gets directly involved in any such upgrade process  the client pays for professional services and expenses 
further  the company believes that its recently acquired greystone m database product see notes to the consolidated financial statements is fully year compliant 
accordingly  the company believes it will not be materially impacted by the year situation relative to any of its product offerings 
as to its own internal software systems and hardware  the company has identified and reviewed all key areas  and has concluded that there is no significant exposure to the year issue 
the cost of upgrading or replacing certain non compliant hardware and software is estimated to be less than  the company s forward looking statements about its revenues  earnings and business development have been derived from its operating budgets and forecasts  which are based upon detailed assumptions about many important factors 
several important factors may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward looking statements made by the company 
these factors include the course of business in the financial services industry  competition among software companies serving that industry  the company s management of the long sales cycle for its products  the timing of new contract closings and other significant events of revenue recognition affecting the company s quarterly results  the development of the direct  emerging and top tier banking markets and market acceptance of the company s products within these markets and the company s ability to continue to improve its products

these amounts will vary depending upon the applicable revenue components subject to such fees

the primary reason for this decline is a  decrease in royalty expense in the period  attributable to a lower level of license fees subject to royalty payment 
general and administrative 
these expenses increased during the year ended december  by million  or  due primarily to a  bad debt allowance which was established during the fourth quarter 
this reserve is required primarily due to an implementation contract in the asian marketplace which has been suspended pending the resolution of the financial and currency crisis in that region

interest income  net  increased  due to income earned on higher invested cash balances 
income tax provision benefit 
taxes in were of income before income taxes  as compared to in this reduced effective rate is primarily the result of certain state net operating loss carryforwards as well as foreign tax credits

the use of cash in operations in and was primarily the result of increases in both contracts in process unbilled receivables and accounts receivable  partially offset in by increased income from operations and in both years by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in  the company experienced significant growth in receivables late in the year  primarily due to three new contracts which closed in december  coupled with the achievement of several significant milestones on other contracts  resulting in significant billings late in the year 
contracts in process also increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in contracts in process is the result of the company s revenue growth in relative to  as well as a contract amendment executed with a significant customer  which effectively deferred certain payment milestones on their implementation project until the later stages of the project
