a substantial majority of the company s revenues in the last three years have been attributable to license fees and related services  including software maintenance and support  implementation  consulting  and training 
the company expects that license and services revenues related to system ess will continue to constitute predominantly all of the company s revenues in the foreseeable future

the company incurs a significant portion of its expenses in swedish krona  including all of its product development expenses and a substantial portion of its general and administrative expenses 
as a result  appreciation of the value of the swedish krona relative to the other currencies in which the company generates revenues  particularly the us dollar  could adversely affect operating results 
the financial statements of the company are translated from the functional currency of the operating subsidiaries into us dollars  the company s reporting currency  utilizing the current rate method 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period  and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period 
all translation gains or losses from the translation into the company s reporting currency are included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
fluctuations in the swedish krona and other currencies relative to the us dollar will affect period to period comparison of the company s reported results of operations 
due to the constantly changing currency exposures and the volatility of currency exchange rates  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can the company predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
the company does not currently undertake hedging transactions to cover its currency exposure  but the company may choose to hedge a portion of its currency exposure in the future as it deems appropriate
