item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a specialized consumer finance company engaged in the purchase and retention of receivables originated by franchised automobile dealers from the sale of new and late model used vehicles to consumers with substandard credit profiles 
at april   the company had a network of  franchised dealers in states from which it purchases the receivables at the time of origination 
the company has completed the licensing process in additional states 
while the company intends to continue to geographically diversify its receivables portfolio  approximately of receivables by principal balance at april  represent receivables acquired from dealers located in texas 
from its inception in through october  the business strategy of the company was to purchase  pool and sell receivables to third party investors and to recognize gains associated with those sales on a current basis 
in november  the company decided that it could achieve a more stable and predictable income stream through acquiring and retaining receivables for net interest income recognized over the life of the receivables 
the primary element in this strategy is access to institutional financing in sufficient magnitudes and at rates enabling the company to purchase significant volumes of receivables and retain them at a funding cost allowing an adequate net interest margin between portfolio yield and cost of funds 
through the utilization of flexible secured credit facilities and comprehensive credit insurance  the company has been able to access financing on terms permitting it to implement this strategy and to pursue it successfully through the present time 
management believes that continued pursuit of this strategy will enable the company to sustain its growth and maintain a stable earnings stream on a relatively conservative basis 
therefore  since november  the primary source of the company s revenues has been interest income from receivables retained as investments  while its primary cost has been interest expense arising from the financing of the company s investment in such receivables 
the profitability of the company during this period has been determined by the growth of the receivables portfolio and effective management of net interest income and fixed operating expenses

represents interest expense as a percentage of average debt outstanding 
represents yield on receivables less average cost of debt 
represents net interest income as a percentage of average receivables outstanding 
the company intends to increase its acquisition of receivables by expanding its dealer base in existing states served  and by expanding its dealer base into new states 
to the extent that the company s receivables acquisitions exceed the extinguishment of receivables through principal payments  payoffs or defaults  its receivables portfolio and interest income will continue to increase 
the following table summarizes the activity in the company s receivables portfolio dollars in thousands years ended april  principal balance  beginning of period   acquisitions   principal payments and payoffs   defaults prior to liquidations and recoveries   principal balance  end of period   represents gross principal balances 
receivables may be paid earlier than their contractual term  primarily due to prepayments and liquidation of collateral after defaults

analysis of net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned from the receivables portfolio and interest expense incurred on the credit facilities used to acquire the receivables 
net interest income increased to million in  an increase of and when compared to amounts reported in and the increase resulted primarily from the growth of the receivables portfolio which was offset by a decline in the effective yield earned on the receivables 
the amount of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the average principal amount of receivables held and average rate earned thereon and the average principal amount of debt incurred to finance such receivables and the average rates paid thereon 
changes in the principal amount and rate components associated with the receivables and debt can be segregated to analyze the periodic changes in net interest income

provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses for increased by  or  over  as a result of an increase in net charge offs from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the increase in charge offs is attributable to the growth in the portfolio  an increase in the number of loans that are seasoned nine to months  which is generally where the highest percentage of repossessions occur and lower recovery amounts on the sale of the vehicle collateral 
at april   the company increased its estimate of losses associated with certain assets held for sale to adjust for lower than expected realized amounts of those assets 
accordingly  an additional  incremental charge was taken in the fourth quarter to adjust the carrying value of the repossessed inventory to better reflect the impact of lower used car prices during the period 
this resulted in a corresponding increase in net charge offs and provision for the period

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash flows 
the company s business requires significant cash flow to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to acquire receivables from dealers and fund required reserve accounts  ii amounts necessary to fund premiums for credit enhancement insurance or other credit enhancement required by the company s financing programs  and iii amounts necessary to fund costs to retain receivables  primarily interest expense and servicing fees 
the company also requires a significant amount of cash flow for working capital to fund fixed operating expenses  primarily salaries and benefits 
the company s most significant cash flow requirement is the acquisition of receivables from dealers 
the company funds the purchase price of receivables through a combination of two warehouse facilities 
the firc credit facility generally permits the company to borrow up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed million 
the fiacc commercial paper facility generally allows the company to borrow up to of the outstanding principal balance of the receivables  but not to exceed million 
the company paid million for receivables acquired in compared to million paid in  all of which was initially funded through the firc credit facility 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility at the option of the company 
the fiarc commercial paper facility provides an additional financing source up to million 
substantially all of the company s receivables are pledged to collateralize these credit facilities 
the company s most significant source of cash flow is the principal and interest payments received from the receivables portfolio 
the company received such payments in the amount of million in and million in such cash flow funds repayment of amounts borrowed under secured financing facilities and other holding costs  primarily interest expense and servicing and custodial fees 
during fiscal years and  the company required net cash flow  respectively  of million and million cash required to acquire receivables net of principal payments on receivables to fund the growth of its receivables portfolio 
the company has relied on borrowed funds to provide the source of cash flow to fund such growth 
capitalization 
since the change in business strategy to retaining receivables in november  the company has financed its acquisition of such receivables primarily through two related credit facilities 
the company s equity was not a significant factor in its capitalization until the completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
however  the company expects to continue to rely primarily on its credit facilities to acquire and retain receivables 
the company believes its existing credit facilities have adequate capacity to fund the increase of the receivables portfolio expected in the foreseeable future 
while the company has no reason to believe that these facilities will not continue to be available  their termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations if substitute financing on comparable terms was not obtained 
firc credit facility 
the primary source of acquisition financing for receivables has been through a syndicated warehouse credit facility agented by nationsbank of texas  na nationsbank 
the firc credit facility currently provides for maximum borrowings  subject to certain adjustments  up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed the current facility limit of million 
borrowings under the firc credit facility bear interest pursuant to certain indexed variable rate options at the election of the company or any other short term fixed interest rate agreed upon by the company and the lenders 
the company bases its selection of the interest rate option primarily on its expectations of market interest rate fluctuations  the timing and the amount of the required funding and the period of time it anticipates requiring the funding prior to transfer to the fiarc commercial paper facility 
the firc credit facility provides for a term of one year at which time the outstanding principal balance will be payable in full  although there are provisions allowing the company a period of six months to refinance the facility in the event that it is not renewed 
the following table summarizes borrowings under the firc credit facility dollars in thousands as of or for the years ended april  at period end balance outstanding   weighted average interest rate during period maximum borrowings outstanding   weighted average balance outstanding   weighted average interest rate based on interest rates  facility fees and hedge instruments applied to borrowings outstanding at period end 
based on month end balances 
fiarc commercial paper facility 
the company has indirect access to the commercial paper market through a million commercial paper conduit facility with enterprise funding corporation enterprise  a commercial paper conduit managed by nationsbank  na receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility by transferring a specific group of receivables to a discrete special purpose financing subsidiary and pledging those receivables as collateral 
receivables are generally transferred from the firc credit facility to the fiarc commercial paper facility to refinance them on a longer term basis at interest rates based on commercial paper rates and to provide additional borrowing capacity under the firc credit facility 
borrowings under this commercial paper facility bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus 
if the fiarc commercial paper facility were terminated  no new receivables could be transferred from the firc credit facility to enterprise  however  the then outstanding receivables would continue to be financed until fully amortized

based on month end balances 
fiacc commercial paper facility 
on january   fiacc entered into a million commercial paper conduit facility with vfcc  a commercial paper conduit administered by first union national bank  to fund the acquisition of additional receivables generated under certain of the company s financing programs 
fiacc acquires receivables from the company and may borrow up to of the face amount of receivables  which are pledged as collateral for the commercial paper borrowings 
vfcc funds the advance to fiacc through the issuance of commercial paper indirectly secured by the receivables to institutional or public investors 
the company is not a guarantor of  or otherwise a party to  such commercial paper 
at april   the maximum borrowings available under the facility were million 
the company s interest cost is based on vfcc s commercial paper rates for specific maturities plus 
in addition  the company is required to pay periodic facility fees of on the unused portion of this facility 
as collections are received on the transferred receivables  they are remitted to a collection account maintained by the collateral agent for the fiacc commercial paper facility 
from that account  a portion of the collected funds are distributed to vfcc in an amount equal to the principal reduction required to maintain the advance rate and to pay carrying costs and related expenses  with the balance released to the company 
in addition to the advance rate  fiacc must maintain a cash reserve as additional credit support for the facility 
the initial term of the fiacc commercial paper facility expires december  if the facility was not extended  no new receivables could be transferred to fiacc and the receivables pledged as collateral would be allowed to amortize 
the company presently intends to seek an extension of this arrangement prior to its expiration 
at april   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
working capital facility 
the company also maintains a million working capital line of credit with nationsbank of texas  na that is utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the company s option of i nationsbank s prime lending rate  or ii a rate equal to above the libor rate for the applicable interest period 
in addition  the company is also required to pay period facility fees  as well as an annual agency fee 
the initial expiration of the facility was july in july  the facility was extended to september  if the lender elected not to renew  any outstanding borrowings would be amortized over a one year period 
the company presently intends to seek an extension of this arrangement prior to its expiration 
at april   there was million outstanding under this facility 
interest rate management 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables that it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s capacity to generate earnings is therefore largely a function of its ability to maintain a sufficient net interest margin 
accordingly  significant increases in the interest rates at which the company borrows funds could promptly reduce the net interest margin between portfolio yield and cost of funds and thereby adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company endeavors to offset rate fluctuation risk by using interest rate management products that convert all or a substantial portion of its floating rate exposure to fixed rates 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure to adverse interest rate movements by entering into interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts which approximate the balance of its debt outstanding under its warehouse and commercial paper credit facilities 
however  the company will be exposed to limited rate fluctuation risk to the extent it cannot perfectly match the timing of net advances from its credit facilities and acquisitions of additional interest rate swaps 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short term basis whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which are generally at the maximum rates allowable by law which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
to manage the risk of fluctuation in the interest rate environment  the company enters into interest rate swaps and caps to lock in what management believes to be an acceptable net interest spread 
during the years ended april   and amounts paid pursuant to the company s interest rate management products were not material in relation to interest expense in the aggregate nor did they have a material impact on the company s weighted average costs of funds during such periods 
the company is currently a party to a swap agreement with nationsbank pursuant to which the company s interest rate exposure is fixed  through january  at a rate of on a notional amount of million as further described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
this agreement may be extended to january  at the sole discretion of the counter party 
as a result  at april   the company had converted a total of million in floating rate debt to a fixed rate and had outstanding floating rate debt of  the company is currently evaluating additional interest rate management products with a view to fixing or limiting its interest rate exposure with respect to amounts that are substantially equivalent to its aggregate outstanding borrowings under the firc credit facility and the commercial paper facilities 
delinquency and credit loss experience the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by nonperforming receivables 
the company seeks to manage its risk of credit loss through prudent credit evaluations and effective collection procedures  and  to a lesser extent  requiring recourse to dealers under its participating program for a period of time and thereafter maintaining cash reserves in the event of losses or by purchasing insurance against certain losses from independent third party insurers 
as a result of its recourse programs and third party insurance  the company is not exposed to credit losses on its entire receivables portfolio 
the following table summarizes the credit loss exposure of the company dollars in thousands april  receivables reserve receivables reserve balance balance balance balance core program insured by third party insurer  other receivables     participating program   allowance for credit losses as a percentage of other receivables dealer reserves as a percentage of participating program receivables represents receivables reinsured by company s insurance affiliate or receivables financed under one of the company s commercial paper conduit facilities on which no credit loss insurance exists

the company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest 
accrual of interest is suspended when the payment from the borrower is over days past due 
generally  repossession procedures are initiated to days after the payment default 
core program 
under the core program  the company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables acquired 
historically  the company has purchased credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
until march  such insurance absorbed substantially all credit losses 
in april  the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter 
in addition  receivables financed under the fiarc and fiacc commercial paper facilities do not carry default insurance 
provisions for credit losses of  and  have been recorded for the years ended april  and  respectively for losses on receivables which are either uninsured or which are reinsured by the company s captive insurance subsidiary 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of losses for receivables that may become uncollectable 
in making this estimate  management analyzes portfolio characteristics in the light of its underwriting criteria  delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and size  quality and concentration of the receivables  as well as external factors such as future economic outlooks 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
participating program 
under the company s participating program  the dealer retains the credit risk for a period of time  usually twelve to eighteen months 
in the event of payment default  the dealer is obligated to repurchase the receivable 
a specified portion of the purchase price is set aside in a reserve account to secure performance of the dealer s repurchase obligation 
receivables purchased from each dealer are aggregated into pools of specified size for purposes of tracking the dealer s participation 
when the dealer s participation in a pool is terminated  a portion of the reserve account exceeding a specified percentage is released to the dealer and the balance is retained in the reserve account to fund credit losses until all receivables in the pool are paid in full 
as a result of establishing relationships only with franchised dealers and securing each dealer s repurchase obligation with a funded reserve account  the company has incurred no losses under the participating program 
the following table summarizes the status and collection experience of all receivables acquired by the company dollars in thousands as of or for the years ended april  number number of loans amount of loans amount delinquent amount outstanding days   days days or more   total delinquencies   total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding during the period amounts of delinquent receivables outstanding and total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables are based on gross receivables balances  which include principal outstanding plus unearned interest income 
does not give effect to reimbursements under the company s credit enhancement insurance policies with respect to charged off receivables 
the company recognized no charge offs prior to march since all credit losses were reimbursed under such policies 
subsequent to that time the primary coverage has been reinsured by an affiliate of the company under arrangements whereby the company bears the entire risk of credit losses  and charge offs have accordingly been recognized 
year issue like all other financial service providers  the company utilizes systems that may be affected by year transition issues 
the company has reviewed the year issue and has identified three primary areas in which it could be affected 
first  the company utilizes a software program in connection with its loan origination and loan funding functions 
the software vendor has indicated to the company that its software is year compatible 
therefore  the company believes that it has no material exposure in this area 
second  the company utilizes a number of third party vendors  or computer software provided by these vendors  which perform various administrative functions for the company including general ledger  payroll  cash management  stock transfer services  and collateral or paying agency functions under the company s financing arrangements 
with the exception of cash management services and the collateral or paying agency functions  the vendors that supply material software or services to the company have indicated that its software or internal systems are year compatible 
with respect to cash management providers and the collateral or paying agents  the company is unaware of any potential exposure related to these institutions internal systems 
however  the company intends to analyze these areas further in fiscal year and monitor each institution s progress in addressing any compliance issues 
third  the company has outsourced its loan servicing and collection functions to a third party  gecc see item business servicing 
it is the company s understanding that the systems and software that gecc utilizes to process and account for loan collections on behalf of the company are not currently year compliant 
it is the company s belief  based on discussions with management of gecc  that gecc expects to update its systems to be year compliant in advance of december  to the extent that gecc s system is not updated to address year issues  it could have a material adverse impact on the loan servicing and collection activities related to the company s portfolio of receivables 
the company intends to continue to monitor the progress of this effort to insure that any exposure issues are resolved
