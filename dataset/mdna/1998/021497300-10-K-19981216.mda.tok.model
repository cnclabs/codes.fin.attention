item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is to provide a detailed explanation of the company s financial performance in fiscal  and  the factors that had a significant impact on the company s performance in those periods and a description of any trends affecting financial performance during the periods discussed 
we also describe the amount of the company s cash on hand at the end of fiscal  the amount that the company owed to its lenders on that date  and the additional amounts  if any  available to be borrowed by the company 
in addition  we describe the major changes to the balance sheet 
this information is the primary basis for our belief that we have enough cash and borrowing ability to carry out our business plan for fiscal you should read this section in conjunction with the company s financial statements  including the notes to the financial statements 
during the last eight months of fiscal  the company s operations consisted principally of liquidating its portfolio of loans to repay outstanding debt  maintaining its systems and retaining personnel necessary to resume operations while exploring alternatives to locate new capital  and designing and beginning to implement its strategic initiatives 
due to recent substantial changes to the company s business and operating strategy  we believe that the company s historical financial and operating data are not likely to be indicative of the company s future performance and the company s results of operation for fiscal are not comparable to fiscal general the company substantially expanded its operations during fiscal and and the first four months of fiscal during these periods the company s loan production was million fiscal  million fiscal and million first four months of fiscal 
as it expanded its business  the company s general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in the first four months of fiscal during these periods  a substantial majority of the company s loan production was sold in securitization transactions 
the sale of loans by the company in securitization transactions  as described below  typically results in substantial negative cash flow  because the cash proceeds from the sale of loans in a securitization transaction is substantially less the company s total cost of producing the loans sold 
the combination of negative cash flow from the sale of loans in securitization transactions and increases in general and administrative expenses caused the company  historically  to operate on a substantial negative cash flow basis 
the company s negative cash flow from operations was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for the first four months of fiscal as a result of a million loss in the first quarter of fiscal and continuing cash flow deficits  the company violated certain provisions of its warehouse line 
in february  the warehouse lender requested that the company repay a significant portion of the principal balance of the line or be declared in default 
since a default on the warehouse line would have triggered  among other things  a default on the company s million principal amount of outstanding old notes  the company agreed to reduce the outstanding balance of the warehouse line from million periodically 
the company repaid the balance on june  to generate cash to reduce the outstanding balance of the warehouse line and continue to operate  the company began to liquidate  through sales for cash  its mortgage loan portfolio and the warehouse lender refused to make further advances under the line 
in addition  because the company s old warehouse line was used to fund loans produced by the company prior to their sale  the company substantially curtailed its loan production beginning in january the cash received from the company s sale of loans from its loan portfolio was used to pay down the old warehouse line and other company borrowings and to pay substantial general and administrative expenses to retain personnel and maintain the company s operations while it sought to locate new capital 
on july   the company completed the recapitalization 
as part of the recapitalization  the company received million in proceeds from the private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock at a price of  per share 
in addition  the company issued million of series a convertible preferred stock and million principal amount of current notes in exchange for approximately million principal amount of old notes 
the recapitalization resulted in approximately million of new equity 
securitization transactions securitization transactions historically had been the main source of the company s revenue and income 
in a securitization transaction  a specific group of the company s mortgage loans having similar characteristics  loan type equity or title i and loan amounts are pooled for sale 
by selling loans in a securitization transaction  the company could sell a very large group of loans at one time 
the company sold an average of million of mortgage loans in each of the five securitizations completed in fiscal however  the sale of loans in a securitization transaction generates a significant cash flow deficit  because the cash received by the company from the sale of the loans is significantly less than the company s total cost of producing the loans sold 
the purchaser of the loans in a securitization transaction is a special trust created to purchase and hold title to the loans  to sell debt securities or ownership interests backed by the cash flow to be received on the loans owned by the trust  ie  the principal and interest payments from the company s borrowers  and to distribute payments over time to the holders of securities issued by the trust 
once the trust purchases the loans from the company  it generally has no recourse against the company other than for breaches of certain representations and warranties made by the company at the time the loans were sold 
likewise  after the trust purchases the loans from the company  creditors of the company have no recourse against the loans in the event the company experiences financial difficulties 
the trust purchases the loans from the company with money it obtains by selling the securities 
the trust sells both senior rated securities and issues an unrated subordinate residual security to the company 
only qualified institutional investors  such as insurance companies  banks and thrifts  can purchase the senior securities sold by the trust 
because the company s equity loans are not insured and its title i loans have only limited fha insurance  the trust  as the owner of these mortgage loans  has credit risk 
if the borrowers default on their loans  the trust as the owner of the loans typically will lose its entire investment except to the extent of the limited fha insurance on title i loans 
as a result of these potential losses  the purchasers of the trust s senior securities are willing to buy the securities only if they receive additional assurance that they will get paid 
this assurance is provided by a rating from the national rating agencies  such as standard poor s and moody s 
as a general matter  the more predictable the cash flow to the senior securities  the higher the rating on the senior securities and the lower the yield that will be demanded by purchasers of the senior securities relative to prevailing market yields 
the lower the yield paid to the senior security holders  the greater the positive spread the spread between the interest paid by the company s borrowers on the mortgage loans in the trust and i the interest costs of the senior securities sold and ii fees paid to the trustee and the servicer for servicing the mortgage loans 
in general  the greater the spread  the greater the amount of cash flow in excess of the principal and interest payments to the senior security holders the company anticipates it will receive on the mortgage related securities issued to the company in the securitization  and the greater their fair value 
during fiscal  the company sold million principal amount of loans in securitization transactions that had a weighted average interest rate of and in which the senior securities sold had an initial weighted average yield of 
in order for the senior securities to gain a sufficiently high rating to attract investors  the rating agencies require that the trust create various forms of credit enhancement to increase the likelihood that the loans in the trust will generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest and principal payments on the senior securities 
credit enhancement may be achieved in several ways 
the trust may purchase the loans the company sells in the securitization transaction for a combination of cash and by issuing the company a subordinated residual interest in the securitization 
the security issued by the trust to the company receives cash flow only after required payments of interest and principal have been made to the senior security holders  and absorbs any losses from defaults or foreclosures on the loans in the trust 
the junior subordinated interests issued to the company in securitization transactions are called mortgage related securities 
another credit enhancement is a guaranty  a form of insurance issued by an insurance company 
while some of the company s securitizations have included guaranty insurance  the company has always received a subordinate mortgage related security and has provided over collateralization as credit enhancement in order to achieve acceptable ratings 
credit enhancement may also be achieved through over collateralization 
national rating agencies will give higher ratings if the senior securities receive assurance that they will be paid 
this is achieved by requiring an initial level of over collateralization and by building more over collateralization through the trust s retaining cash flow from the spread that would otherwise be paid to the company on its mortgage related securities 
the initial over collateralization is created by having the principal amount of loans sold to the trust be greater than the principal amount and cash proceeds from the sale of senior interests sold 
in the five securitization transactions during fiscal  the trusts purchased million principal amount of loans from the company  but the trusts sold only principal amount of senior securities 
as borrowers make their monthly mortgage loan payments to the servicer of the loans in the trust  the payments are remitted by the servicer to a trustee that collects these payments and make payments of interest and principal to the holders of the senior securities pursuant to a pre established schedule 
the priority of the payments is determined by the terms of an indenture 
the mortgage related securities owned by the company  while offering the potential of a substantially higher yield than the senior securities  have very high credit risk 
the company s mortgage related securities absorb all losses caused by defaults on the mortgage loans backing the securitization 
the company s mortgage related securities are highly speculative and are subject to the special risks 
sample securitization transaction in order to make the concept of negative cash flow that results from the sale of mortgage loans in a securitization transaction more understandable  the company has provided the following example 
the example below illustrates the mechanics of a securitization and the resulting negative cash flow but does not reflect an actual sale of mortgage loans by the company in a securitization transaction or the actual amount of negative cash flow from the disposition of loans in this manner 
actual results will be materially different from the example 
this example is based on five general assumptions million of mortgage loans having a weighted average interest rate of are sold in a securitization transaction  the loans sold were purchased from mortgage bankers for a premium of million the mortgage bankers received an aggregate of million for the loans  the trust purchases the loans for million in cash  sells million of senior securities having a weighted average interest rate of and issues a subordinate mortgage related security to the seller of the loans  the securitization process costs million in fees and costs paid to investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and others  and standard poor s and moody s require a an initial level of over collateralization of million of the original amount of loans sold in the securitization and b that the level of over collateralization must reach of the original principal amount of loans before the cash flow will be paid by the trustee to the holder of the subordinate mortgage related security 
in this example  the sale of this pool of million of mortgage loans would result in negative cash flow of million 
the negative cash flow results from the following factors million  representing the total cost of producing the loans sold in the securitization minus million is received by the trust from the sale of the senior securities  all of which is paid to the seller of the mortgage loans  minus million of fees and expenses 
the million difference between the million of mortgage loans purchased by the trust and the million of senior securities sold by the trust creates the initial over collateralization 
the senior securities have the protection or credit enhancement of the cash flow  principal and interest received on the million of loans plus the spread initially equal to million per year 
the spread represents the difference between  the interest paid by borrower on the loans in the trust  and  the interest paid by the trust on the senior securities on the million of loans plus on the million of loans in the over collateralization account 
the trustee would retain the spread until the over collateralization reaches million 
after the required level of over collateralization is achieved  the trustee pays all of the cash flow  after the payment of interest and principal to the senior interest  to the company s mortgage related securities 
loan delinquencies and defaults reduce this over collateralization 
if the amount in the account falls below of the amount of loans sold to the trust  the trustee stops the payment of cash to the company s mortgage related securities and retains it until the level is again achieved 
accounting for a securitization transaction under generally accepted accounting principles  the sale of mortgage loans by the company in securitization transactions requires the company to recognize revenue on the completion of the securitization transaction based on the discounted present value of the estimated future cash flow stream gain on sale accounting to be received by the company on its mortgage related securities 
as described in more detail later in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  the company determines the fair value of each of its mortgage related securities using prepayment  delinquency  default and credit loss assumptions on the mortgage loans backing each of its mortgage related securities that the company believes to be appropriate for the particular mortgage loans 
the anticipated cash to be received by the company s mortgage related securities from the mortgage loans is discounted to present value to establish the fair value of the mortgage related securities shown on the company s balance sheet 
accounting for specialty finance companies that sell assets in securitization transactions is particularly complex 
the most complex item is the source of the company revenues 
the company gets its revenues from the following items gain loss on the sale of loans  unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities retained in securitization transactions  interest income  net  and loan servicing income  net 
gain loss on the sale of loans 
historically  the most significant portion of the company s revenues comes from gain loss on the sale of loans 
one component is the gain loss resulting from the sale of loans in securitization transactions 
refer to the example the company used earlier  where the sale of million of our loans in the securitization transaction resulted in negative cash flow of million 
assume the mortgage related security issued by the trust to the seller of the loans from that securitization had a fair value of million see discussion on gain on sale accounting above 
the seller then would have received a total of million from the securitization  consisting of million in cash and a mortgage related security having a fair value of million 
the total cost of the loans sold in the securitization were million  consisting of the total cost of producing the loans of million and million in fees and expenses for the securitization 
in this example  the revenues recorded from this securitization would be million 
this amount is divided between two revenue items  gain loss on sale of loans and net unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities 
the division of the revenues between these two items is determined by allocating the total revenues of million  proportionately between the cash proceeds from the sale of the loans  in this case million allocated to revenues from gain loss on the sale of loans  and the fair value of the mortgage related security issued by the trust to the seller of the loans in the securitization  in this case million allocated to revenues from unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities 
another component represents the gain loss on the sale of loans for cash 
it is equal to the company s total cost expense of producing loans including any premiums paid when the company purchases loans from its network of mortgage bankers  minus the amount received by the company at the time the loans are sold for cash to an institutional purchaser 
for example  if the company purchased a  principal balance loan from a mortgage banker for  and sold that loan to an institutional purchaser for  the company would recognize  of revenue from gain on the sale of loans 
unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities retained in securitization transactions 
revenues from unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities results from the allocation of total revenues from the sale of mortgage loans in securitization transactions described immediately above and from two other sources 
revenues from the amortization on the company s mortgage related securities generally is equal to the amount of cash flow received on the company s mortgage related securities 
in addition  unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities generates negative revenues equal to i the write down  if any  of the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities  and ii positive revenues from the write up  if any  of those securities 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  is the interest received by the company on its portfolio of mortgage loans prior to their sale plus accretion interest on its mortgage related securities minus the company s interest expense on its borrowings including its subordinated debt  warehouse line of credit and other borrowings 
loan servicing income  net 
loan servicing income  net  are the fees paid to the company for servicing loans owned by the company or loans sold with servicing retained 
the prepayment penalties  if any  received from the company s borrowers who repay their loans prior to their scheduled maturity date are included in loan servicing income  net 
as discussed earlier in this prospectus  the company historically retained the servicing on a substantial majority of loans it sold 
the company uses net as a part of the revenues from loan servicing because  under generally accepted accounting principles  the amount of servicing fees earned is reduced by the amortization of the company s servicing rights 
the company values the anticipated servicing fees the company will receive for servicing a loan from inception until its anticipated maturity and discounts the anticipated cash flow to its present value similar to the way the company determines the fair value of its mortgage related securities 
historically  the company s fee for servicing a loan was of the loan s outstanding principal balance 
the fair value of the anticipated cash flow is recorded on the company s balance sheet as mortgage servicing rights 
as servicing revenues are received  the discounted present value of the future cash flow is reduced 
the amount of the reduction is the amortization 
revenue from mortgage servicing rights will not be significant in the future  because the company sold all of its servicing rights to city mortgage servicing as part of the recapitalization 
revision of assumptions as described immediately above  the most significant source of the company s revenues and income historically has resulted from the sale of loans produced by the company in securitization transactions and the fair value of the mortgage related security issued to the company by the trusts 
the company projects the anticipated cash flow to be received from the loans backing its mortgage related securities based on assumptions of voluntary prepayment speeds and losses 
when prepayments  delinquencies  default and credit losses on the mortgage loans backing the company s mortgage related securities exceed the company s assumptions  the company is required to modify its assumptions as to the prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and credit loss rates on the mortgage loans backing its mortgage related securities 
this generally reduces the anticipated cash flow to be received from the mortgage loans and results in a write down in the fair value of the particular mortgage related securities 
the amount of the writedown is treated as negative revenues from unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities 
the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities are affected by  among other things  changes in market interest rates and prepayment and loss experiences of these and similar securities 
the company estimates the fair value of its mortgage related securities using prepayment and credit loss assumptions on the mortgage loans backing these securities that the company believes to be appropriate for the characteristics weighted average interest rate  weighted average maturity date  etc 
of the mortgage loans backing each particular securitization 
the company discounts the projected cash flow at the rate it believes an independent third party purchaser would require as a rate of return 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company experienced prepayment activity and delinquencies with respect to its securitized equity loans  which substantially exceeded the levels that had been assumed for the applicable time frame 
as a result of this increase  the company adjusted the assumptions previously utilized in calculating the carrying value of its mortgage related securities 
the application of these revised assumptions to the company s portfolio of equity and title i loans backing its mortgage related securities caused the company to adjust the carrying value of these securities by approximately million during fiscal the changes in prepayment and credit loss assumptions also caused the company to write down the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights by million during fiscal as discussed earlier in this prospectus  the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities and the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights are determined in a similar manner 
the company has revised its assumptions based on information from a variety of sources including  among other things  the company s experience with its own portfolio of loans  pertinent information from a variety of market sources and consultations with its financial advisors 
however  the company has not obtained an independent evaluation of the assumptions utilized in calculating the carrying value of its mortgage related securities for any period subsequent to august  to the company s knowledge  there is no active market for the sale of these securities 
during the year ended august   negative adjustments of approximately million were recognized 
see note to the company s financial statements 
although the company believes that it has made reasonable estimates of the prepayment and default rates in determining the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities  the rate of prepayments and defaults utilized are estimates  and actual experience will vary from these estimates and such variances may be material 
there can be no assurance that the revised prepayment and loss assumptions used to determine the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities and mortgage servicing rights will remain appropriate for the life of the loans backing such securities 
if actual loan prepayments or credit losses vary from the company s estimates  the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities and mortgage servicing rights  if any  may have to be further adjusted through a charge or credit to earnings 
the company s revised prepayment assumptions used for title i loans at august  reflect an annualized rate of for the life of the portfolio 
actual annualized prepayment rates of the title i loans backing the company s mortgage related securities were for the fiscal year ended august  and for the six months ended august  these revised loss assumptions for title i loans at august  are based on a historical migration analysis of delinquent loans that the company anticipates will become defaulted loans 
the new assumed default rate and the restricted rates are shown below in the following model and historical default rates historical default rates for the periods ended august  new assumed delinquency days status default rates months months months over the company assumes that a defaulted title i loan will result in loss of of the loan balance and that all title i insurance has been exhausted 
on a cumulative basis  the new assumptions anticipate aggregate losses of of the original principal balance of title i loans 
the prepayment assumptions for equity loans were also increased at the end of fiscal to reflect an annualized prepayment rate of in the first month following the completion of the securitization with the annualized rate increases in level monthly increments so that by the th month the annualized prepayment rate is 
the annualized prepayment rate is maintained at that level through the th month at which time it is assumed to decline in level monthly increments to by the rd month  and is maintained at for the remaining life of the portfolio 
the weighted average annualized prepayment speed for the loans backing the company s mortgage related securities was during fiscal and during fiscal the loss assumptions for the equity loans backing the company s mortgage related securities have also been increased to reflect losses commencing in the second month following a securitization and building in level monthly increments until a annualized loss rate is reached in the th month 
the annualized loss rate is maintained at that level through the rd month at which time it is assumed to decline in level monthly increments to at month and is maintained for the life of the portfolio 
on a cumulative basis this model assumes aggregate losses of approximately of the initial principal balance of equity loans backing the company s mortgage related securities 
the actual losses on equity loans backing the company s mortgage related securities during fiscal were approximately of the original principal balance 
the company utilizes a discount rate at august  to discount to their present sale of the cash flow streams to be received by the company on its mortgage related securities 
during fiscal and  the company used an annual weighted average discount rate of for title i and equity loans and generally utilized annual prepayment assumptions ranging from to  annual estimated losses of up to on equity loans resulting in an aggregate loss of  and estimated losses on title i loans based on the then current migration analysis and assuming recoveries of after exhaustion of insured reserves 
we believe that due to recent substantial changes to the company s business and operating strategy  the company s historical financial and operating data is not likely to be indicative of the company s future performance 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal as previously discussed  the company reduced substantially its loan production after january  as compared to the first four months of fiscal in the last eight months of fiscal  the company focused on liquidating its loan portfolio for cash to reduce its indebtedness while it explored alternatives to raise new capital and initiating new strategic initiatives to return the company to profitability 
as a result  the company does not believe that its results for fiscal are comparable to the company s results for fiscal the company produced million of loans during fiscal compared to million of loans during fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease is due to a substantial reduction in the company s loan production after january caused by the company s inability to obtain funds to produce loans due to its violation of covenants contained in the old warehouse line 
the company s loan production by month during fiscal and is illustrated in the chart below 

chart reflecting monthly loan production in fiscal and fiscal in millions of dollars as follows 
fiscal year fiscal year september october november december january february march april may june july august net revenues 
net revenues were negative million during fiscal compared with positive million during fiscal the company s revenues are determined largely by special accounting requirements that required the company in fiscal to recognize significant revenue on loans sold in securitization transactions gain on sale even though these transactions generated negative cash flow 
we have separated below the following four components of the company s revenues in fiscal and compared them to the same four components of revenue in fiscal revenues from gain loss on sale of loans in securitization transactions for cash revenues from net unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities loan servicing income  net revenues from net interest income revenues from gain loss on sale of loans in fiscal were a negative million compared to a positive million in fiscal the table below shows the principal components of gain loss on sale of loans in each of these periods 
components of gain loss on the sale of loans fiscal fiscal thousands of dollars gain loss on the sale of loans in securitization transactions   gain on the sale of loans for cash  mark to market adjustment to loans held for sale  write off of loan origination costs   write off of commitment fee  amortization of commitment fee write off of placement fee   interest expense write off of servicing  total   revenues from gain on the sale of loans in securitization transactions in fiscal of million resulted from the allocation of of the million total revenues earned by the company on loans sold in these transactions 
the million balance of these revenues was allocated to net unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities 
in fiscal  the company sold million principal amount of loans in securitization transactions  with a total cost of production of million 
this includes premiums of million of the principal amount of the company s loans produced paid to the company s network of mortgage bankers for closed loans 
in fiscal  only million principal amount of loans were sold in securitization transactions 
the substantially lower amount of loans sold in securitization transactions in fiscal and the lower revenues from these transactions resulted from the continuing cash flow deficits of the company 
these deficits were principally due to substantial increases in the company s loan production in fiscal  the sale of these loans in securitization transactions and a major increase in general and administrative expenses 
revenues from gain on the sale of loans for cash were million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the company sold million principal amount of loans for cash as part of its plan to continue operating while it was exploring alternatives for locating new capital 
the company s total cost of producing these loans was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal representing of the million of the amount of loans sold for cash in that period 
in fiscal  revenues from the sale of million principal amount of loans for cash were  the company believes that its loan sales for cash in fiscal may have been adversely impacted by the market s knowledge that the company was liquidating its loan portfolio to pay down the company s lenders 
the company s revenues from gain loss on the sale of loans for cash in fiscal were also impacted by a lower of cost or market write down of million of the company s million principal amount of loans in its portfolio at the end of fiscal the loans in the company s portfolio at august  primarily had document deficiencies or the borrowers were delinquent in their loan payments 
the lower of cost or market adjustment is based on the company s estimate of the proceeds to be received when these loans are sold 
the company believes that liquidity shortage in the specialty finance industry may have also hurt the market value of these loans 
as part of the recapitalization  the company terminated its master warehouse agreement with greenwich capital markets 
this termination resulted in negative revenues of million from gain loss on sale of loans due to the write off of a million commitment fee 
negative revenues of million also resulted from payments to greenwich capital markets in connection with their sale of the company s loans 
for additional details  see certain relationships and related transactions 
revenues from net unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities were negative million in fiscal compared to a positive million in fiscal substantially all of fiscal s negative revenues resulted from a write down of million in the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities 
the write down was required because prepayment  delinquency  default and credit loss rates on the equity and title i loans backing these securities substantially exceeded the assumptions the company used to value its mortgage related securities at the end of fiscal these loans were produced by the company in prior periods 
additionally  in response to recent adverse changes in the liquidity and market value of these and other similar asset backed residual interests  the company increased the rate used to discount to present value the anticipated cash flow to be received on its mortgage related securities from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the positive revenues of million from net unrealized gain loss on mortgage related securities recorded in fiscal resulted from a write up of million in the fair value of the company s mortgage related securities and favorable cash flow from the company s mortgage related securities 
in august  the company pooled approximately million of loans with approximately million of loans from a second party to create a home loan owner trust securitization 
the company was issued a residual interest mortgage related security in this securitization calculated on the pro rata share of the company loans originated in the total pool 
this residual interest mortgage related security will be owned two thirds by the company and one third by greenwich capital markets 
cash flow on the company s residual interest mortgage related security will be subordinated to recovery by greenwich of premium paid for in the acquisition of the pool  upfront overcollaterization of of the total pool  greenwich s underwriting fee and transaction costs 
the total of these recoveries will accrue interest at a per annum rate until recovered 
the target overcollaterization level of must be achieved prior to recovery by greenwich 
see certain relationships and related transactions relationship with greenwich 
loan servicing income  net  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was a result of negative revenues of million from a write down in the fair value of the company s mortgage servicing rights in the third quarter of fiscal due to an increase in the company assumptions of prepayment  delinquency  default and credit loss rates on the loans in the company s servicing portfolio  which reduced the discounted present value of the company s anticipated servicing revenues on those loans 
in addition  in fiscal the company had negative loan servicing revenues of  from the loss on the sale of the company s servicing rights to city mortgage services as part of the recapitalization 
revenues from net interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the table below shows the amount of the company s interest income and interest expense for fiscal and net interest income fiscal fiscal thousands of dollars interest income short term investments and accretion on mortgage related securities   loans held in portfolio pending sale   cash total interest income   interest expense subordinated debt   old warehouse line   other borrowings total interest expense   net interest income   interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to the sale of the company s loan production in cash transactions over a period of time  compared to the sale of fiscal loan production in quarterly securitization transactions 
in addition  the company earned approximately  in interest in fiscal from the short term investment of million in proceeds from the recapitalization 
interest expense in fiscal was substantially higher than interest expense in fiscal due primarily to additional interest expense of million on the company s subordinated debt as a result of the october sale of million principal amount of subordinated notes 
in addition  the company borrowed an aggregate of million secured by certain of its mortgage related securities in the first quarter of fiscal the principal amount of these borrowings were outstanding for all of fiscal and for only a portion of fiscal provision for credit losses 
the net provision for credit losses decreased million to income of million for fiscal from losses of million for fiscal the decrease in the provision for credit losses was due to the decrease in the volume of loans produced and the ratio of equity loans to title i loans produced during fiscal compared to fiscal an allowance for credit losses is not established on loans sold in securitization transactions  because the company typically does not have recourse obligations for these losses 
estimated credit losses on loans sold in securitization transactions are considered in the company s determination of the fair value of its mortgage related securities 
the provision for credit losses is based upon periodic analysis of the portfolio  economic conditions and trends  historical credit loss experience  borrowers ability to repay  collateral values  and estimated fha insurance recoveries on title i loans originated and sold 
total general and administrative expenses 
total general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase was primarily a result of increased costs of professional services due to increased outside legal and audit expenses associated with additional securities filings  the recapitalization  amendments to existing debt agreements  increased loan servicing expenses due to an increase in loans serviced  and increased payroll and benefits related to the hiring of additional personnel to support the company s expansion in the first quarter of fiscal the substantial individual changes in general and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail below 
payroll and benefits expense increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal primarily due to an increased number of employees prior to january and expenses associated with the reduction in the company s workforce 
although the number of employees decreased to at august  from at august   the average number of employees employed was higher during fiscal than fiscal credit reports expense decreased  or  to  during fiscal from million for fiscal due to the decrease in loan production during the second half of fiscal rent and lease expenses increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to annual escalation in rent and expiration of tenant discounts the company enjoyed in fiscal for office space at the company s corporate offices 
professional services increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to increased outside legal and audit expenses associated with the company s private placement of million principal amount of old notes in fiscal  additional securities filings  amendments to existing debt agreements and higher consulting and management services expenses 
a substantial portion of the increase in professional services was due to actions taken by the company subsequent to january  as a result of its adverse financial position and the recapitalization 
sub servicing fees increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to a larger average loan servicing portfolio  partially offset by a lower sub servicing rate paid to the sub servicer in the latter part of fiscal other services increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to higher telephone and overnight mailing expenses 
fha insurance expense decreased  or  to  during fiscal from  during fiscal due to decreased production of insured title i loans

the sovereign warehouse line terminates on december  and is renewable  as sovereign s option  in six month intervals for up to five years 
under the flow purchase agreement  sovereign has agreed to purchase at least million per quarter in principal amount of the company s loans at specified prices 
the flow purchase agreement expires on september  as part of the company s new business strategy  on a going forward basis  the company intends to generate most of its cash for operations through the sale of the loans produced by the company to institutional purchasers 
in april  the company entered into a pledge and security agreement with another financial institution for an million revolving credit facility 
the amount which can be borrowed under the agreement was increased to million in june and million in july this facility is secured by a pledge of certain of the company s interest only and residual class certificates relating to securitizations carried as mortgage related securities on the company s statements of financial condition  payable to the company pursuant to its securitization agreements 
a portion of the loans under the credit line agreement accrues interest at one month libor at august   expiring one year from the initial advance 
as of august   approximately million was outstanding under the agreement 
the agreement was scheduled to mature in december the company  however  is currently in the process of negotiating an amendment to the pledge and security agreement which would provide for a the repayment in december of a portion of the amount outstanding under the agreement and repayment of the remaining outstanding amounts  along with accrued interest  in monthly installments during calendar year in october  the company entered into a credit agreement with another financial institution for an million revolving line of credit 
this institution funded million of this credit facility 
the facility is secured by a pledge of certain of the company s mortgage related securities 
the loan balance under this agreement bears interest at the prime rate plus at august  
in may  this loan converted into a term loan with monthly amortization derived from the cash flow generated from the respective mortgage related certificates 
this term loan bears interest at the prime rate plus at august  
this facility matures in october as of august   approximately million was outstanding under the agreement 
the company is currently negotiating an amendment to this facility that would provide for i a waiver of certain defaults by the company under the facility prior to september  ii an adjustment to the company s net worth covenant  iii an adjustment to the advance rate  and iv the paydown by the company of a portion of the amount outstanding under the facility 
the company believes that its financing sources are adequate to meet its current needs 
liquidity uses the company s liquidity is primarily used to originate loans  pay operating and interest expenses and historically  to fund the negative cash flow from the sale of loans in securitization transactions 
substantially all of the loans produced by the company are sold 
the sovereign warehouse line is to be repaid primarily from the proceeds from the sale of the loans collateralizing the line in the secondary market 
the company resumed the production of new loans on july  the company s cash requirements necessitate continued access to sources of warehouse financing and sales of loans in the secondary market for premiums 
in the ordinary course of business  the company makes representations and warranties to the purchasers of mortgage loans and the related servicing rights regarding compliance with laws  regulations and program standards and as to accuracy of information 
under certain recourse provisions the company may become liable for certain damages or may be required to repurchase a loan if there has been a breach of these representations or warranties 
pursuant to recourse provisions under certain wholesale agreements  the company was obligated to repurchase equity and title i loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million at august  these loans  which are reflected in the company s statement of financial condition under loans held for sale  were valued utilizing the company s estimate of the price to be received upon their final disposition 
based on the estimated price  a lower of cost or market allowance of million was recorded for fiscal  as a charge to gain loss on sale of loans in the company s statement of operations 
an additional lower of cost or market allowance of million relating to the million principal balance of the company s loans held for sale at august  was recorded for fiscal  as a charge to gain loss on sale of loans in the company s statement of operations 
the company generally expects to incur monthly operating expenses of approximately million 
until the company begins to operate on a positive cash flow basis  such monthly operating expenses are expected to be funded out of the remaining proceeds of the recapitalization and from amounts borrowed under the company s credit facilities 
the company may effect a reduction in its real estate lease expenditures through the subletting of all or a portion of its current office space 
if the company subleases all of its current office space  the company intends to relocate its corporate offices to another location suitable for the company s needs 
at august   no commitments existed for additional material capital expenditures 
however  the company expects to incur additional costs in connection with the implementation of its revised business strategy 
specifically  the company anticipates that it may need to hire additional personnel in order to carry out its strategic plan 
the hiring of such additional personnel would require the company to incur additional expenses 
net cash used in the company s operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company used net cash of million in fiscal and  in fiscal  in investing activities  substantially for office equipment and furnishing and data processing equipment 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal and million in fiscal this resulted principally from the sale of million of old notes in october  the sale of million of common stock and million principal amount of old notes in november and the sale of million of common stock and preferred stock in the recapitalization 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s various business activities generate liquidity  market and credit risk liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s positions less valuable 
credit risk is the possibility loss from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of the transaction 
compensation for assuming these risks is reflected in interest income and fee income 
the following table provides information as of august  about the company s mortgage related securities and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents sensitivity analysis associated with fluctuations in prepayment speeds  increase or decrease in defaulted loans and the discount rates associated with valuing the securities 
chart description 
chart reflecting effect of changing interest rates on the company s assumptions with respect to default rates  discount rates and prepayment rates on the company s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk 
change in interest rate default rate discount rate prepayment rate although the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the borrowers  this exposure is managed through credit approvals  review and monitoring procedures into the extent possible restricting the period during which unpaid balances are allowed to accumulate 
as of august  the net fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical shift in interest rates would be approximately million 
there are certain shortcomings inherent to the sensitivity analysis presented 
the model assumes interest rate increase are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  changes are rarely instantaneous 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react in line with changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
prepayments on the company s mortgage related instruments are directly affected by a change in interest rates 
as such  the table considers prepayment risk 
however  in the event of a change in interest rates  actual loan prepayments may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the table 
further  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  such as annual and lifetime caps that restrict changing the interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
finally  the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interiors rate increase 
effects of changing prices and inflation the company s operations are sensitive to increases in interest rates and to inflation 
increased borrowing costs resulting from increases in interest rates may not be immediately recoverable from prospective purchasers 
the company s loans held for sale consist primarily of fixed rate long term obligations the interest rates of which do not increase or decrease as a result of changes in interest rates charged to the company 
in addition  delinquency and loss exposure may be affected by changes in the national economy 
see note to the company s financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was issued by the fasb in june sfas provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement also provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
it requires that liabilities and derivatives incurred or obtained by transferors as part of a transfer of financial assets be initially measured at fair value 
sfas also requires that servicing assets be measured by allocating the carrying amount between the assets sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
additionally  this statement requires that the servicing assets and liabilities be subsequently measured by a amortization in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or loss and b assessment for asset impairment or increased obligation based on their fair values 
the statement requires that the company s excess servicing rights be measured at fair market value and be reclassified as interest only receivables and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as required by the statement  the company adopted the new requirements effective january  implementation of the statement did not have any material impact on the financial statements of the company  as the book value of the company s excess servicing rights and mortgage related securities approximated fair value 
sfas no 
 earnings per share was issued by the fasb in march  effective for financial statements issued after december  sfas provides simplified standards for the computation and presentation of earnings per share eps  making eps comparable to international standards 
sfas requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps  by entities with complex capital structures  replacing primary and fully diluted eps under apb opinion no 
basic eps excludes dilution from common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution from common stock equivalents  similar to fully diluted eps  but uses only the average stock price during the period as part of the computation 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes standards of reporting by publicly held business enterprises and disclosure of information about operating segments in annual financial statements and  to a lesser extent  in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
sfas nos 
and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as both sfas nos 
and deal with financial statement disclosure  the company does not anticipate the adoption of these new standards will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company has not yet determined what its reporting segments will be under sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires the entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of these designated derivatives hedge accounting depends on the intended use and designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of its hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
sfas is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet evaluated the effect of adopting sfas in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by mortgage banking enterprise sfas  which allows the reclassification of mortgage related securities and other beneficial interests retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale from the trading category  as required by fasb  to either available for sale or held to maturity based upon the company s ability and intent to hold those investments 
sfas is effective for the first quarter beginning after december  the company has not yet evaluated the effect of adopting sfas as of august   all mortgage related securities are classified as trading securities 
seasonality the company s production of home equity and equity loans is seasonal to the extent that borrowers used the proceeds for home improvement contract work 
the company s production of loans for this purpose tends to build during the spring and early summer months  particularly where the proceeds are used for pool installations 
a decline is typically experienced in late summer and early fall until temperatures begin to drop 
this change in seasons precipitates the need for new siding  window and insulation contracts 
peak volume is experienced in november and early december and declines dramatically from the holiday season through the winter months 
while the company does not have substantial experience making loans to borrowers who intend to use the proceeds to purchase a residence  management believes that the market for such loans will follow the home sale cycle  higher in the spring through early fall than during the remainder of the year 
impact of the year issue the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as embedded computer chips contained in devices and special codes in software that make use of the date field 
the company has developed plans to address the year issue 
the company s present year plan consists of five phases inventory of business critical information technology assets  assessment of repair requirements  repair or replacement  testing of systems  and creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
as of august   the company had completed the first and second phases of the year plan for its own business critical information technology assets including its accounting systems  loan origination systems  word and data processing systems  customer telephone service center  and business machines 
the company is relying upon the representations of third party vendors as to the year readiness of certain of its software  its business machines  such as copiers and facsimile machines  and of facilities  such as physical office locations 
the company does not have plans for testing embedded computer chips contained in devices  or in special codes in software that make use of the date field incidental to their operation 
all five phases of the company s year plan are expected to be completed by august  based on information currently available  the company s costs to remedy its own critical information technology assets are estimated to be approximately  these costs will cover hardware and software upgrades  systems consulting and computer maintenance 
the company plans to charge these costs to expense as incurred  and it believes such costs will not have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
as part of its year plan  the company has accelerated the schedule of implementation of certain of the company s previously planned information technology projects 
therefore  the company does not expect to defer any specific information technology project as a result of the implementation of its year plan 
until system testing is substantially in process  the company cannot fully estimate the risks of the year issue 
to date  the company has not identified any of its own business critical information technology assets that it believes present a material risk of not being year compliant or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
however  as the company s year plan proceeds into subsequent phases  it is possible that the company may identify assets that do present a risk of a year related disruption 
such a disruption would have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
because the company has not begun system testing  and  accordingly  has not fully assessed its risks from potential year failures  the company has not yet developed specific year contingency plans 
as of august   the company had begun to make inquiry of substantially all of its strategic partners  vendors and third party entities with which it has material relationships  and had begun to compile data related to their year plans 
the company s reliance upon certain third parties  vendors and strategic partners for loan servicing  investor reporting  document custody and other functions  means that their failure to adequately address the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results 
the company has received assurances from its two major strategic partners  city mortgage services and sovereign bank  na  that they have implemented plans to address the year issue 
the company has not evaluated these plans or assurances for their accuracy and adequacy  or developed contingency plans in the event of their failure 
the company has not yet received a significant number of responses from its vendors or other third parties  and therefore potential risks related to their failure to address year issues are not known at this time 
the company also relies upon certain government entities such as the us dept 
of housing and urban development and various state regulatory agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there can be no assurance that such suppliers  government entities  or other third parties will not suffer a year business disruption 
such failures would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s credit risk associated with its borrowers may increase as a result of borrowers individual year issues 
negative impact of year issues upon borrowers may result in borrowers inability to pay  increases in delinquent loans  and a loss of residual income to the company 
while at this time  it is not possible to calculate the potential impact of such increased delinquent loans  it is believed that increased delinquencies would have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of the company 
because of uncertainties  the actual effects of the year issue on the company may be different from the company s current assessment 
the effect on the company s results of operations if the company  its strategic partners  vendors or other third parties are not fully year compliant is not reasonably estimable 
the description of the company s year plans contain forward looking statements about matters that are inherently difficult to predict 
those statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company and its management 
some of the important factors that affect these statements have been briefly described 
such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect future developments such as  for example  the ability to deal with the year issue  including problems that may arise on the part of third parties 
if the repairs and modifications required to make the company year ready are not made or are not completed on a timely basis  the resulting problems would have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements this annual report contains certain statements as to our future expectations  which are referred to as forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us 
these forward looking statements are principally contained in the sections management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
they relate to our expectations and estimates of the company s business operations  including the implementation of new business and operating strategies  future financial performance  and expected growth in revenues  net income and cash flows 
however  these statements reflect only our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
you must keep in mind that factors such as a history of losses  risks associated with implementing a new strategic plan  risks associated with a new management team  and general economic conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or if our assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may materially differ from the results expressed in this prospectus  as anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
in addition  we believe that due to recent substantial changes to the company s business and operating strategies  the company s historical financial and operating data are not likely to be indicative of the company s future performance
