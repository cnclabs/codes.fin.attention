the company expects that available cash will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements over the near term 
year matters the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in  the company initiated a conversion from existing accounting software to programs that are year compliant 
management has determined that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
as a result  all costs associated with this conversion are being expensed as incurred 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project within one year but not later than october   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
