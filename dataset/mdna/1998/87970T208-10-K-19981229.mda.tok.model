item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which allows most standard wireline customer premises equipment phones  facsimile machines  computer modems  pbxs  and key systems  among others to operate over wireless telecommunications networks 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is exhibit to this form k 
overview the company has seen substantial growth in the market for fwts in both wll and waa systems 
the company encountered heightened activity during fiscal year that gives it reason to believe that the fwt market is maturing 
excluding the motorola wll project in hungary during fiscal year  the company quoted more contracts  shipped more product more than fiscal year and observed more data that confirmed momentum in the fwt market than during any previous period 
the major trends driving the market include a broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of fwts as cost effective answers to customer demand for improved telecommunications and pcs licensing that will drive down the price of wireless communications and expand the number of users within the us however  poor economic conditions in asia  which negatively affected the company s prospects during fiscal year  may continue for some time 
wll  which is the core of the company s fwt business in developing countries  involves cellular infrastructure employed predominately and sometimes exclusively for the fixed location user 
continued growth of the wll market depends primarily on the pricing of wll airtime service to the customer relative to available wireline prices  the relative local availability of wll and wireline service  operator regulatory constraints on fixed cellular  and availability of money in a given country 
these factors have contributed to the increase in the number of new wll networks commissioned in because fwt deployment lags network commissioning  the company believes the pent up opportunity for its products is very large 
waa  which represents the majority of the company s sales in developed countries  has primarily involved wireless back up of existing wireline systems  and where wireline service is unavailable or unreliable  using mobile cellular networks built primarily for handheld cellular phone users 
management anticipates that additional fwt markets for waa applications will develop as existing cellular networks mature and new networks and services are introduced 
as capacity and price competition increase on new and existing cellular networks and the growth rate in new cellular phone subscribers slows  mobile cellular operators will be forced to look for new revenue sources 
fwts provide an excellent opportunity for cellular network operators  as they are less costly to support than mobile units permanently linked to a specific cell site  generate more average airtime  and operate mainly at off peak times 
the number of fwts presently operating on waa networks exceeds that of wll and is driven by the relative price for airtime  as well as by the large installed base of mobile networks worldwide 
the company has a number of undertakings that embody its strategy to capitalize on the growth it anticipates for fwts 
during fiscal year  the company added new personnel in each of its international sales offices and will continue to strengthen and build its sales and marketing organizations 
the company s product development program is designed to result in a line of fwts over the next two years that will address the cellular radio standards projected to serve of all cellular subscribers in the year during fiscal year  the company s fwts continued to gain market position on its major radio standards see company strategy in item above for more detail 
the company introduced several new phonecells during fiscal year these included two new analog amps fwts  the sx i amps and the sx e amps  a new digital tdma fwt  the sx e tdma  and a new digital cdma fwt  the sx e cdma 
all of these products cost less to make and have more features than predecessor versions 
the sx amps units include a transceiver that was designed by the company 
the company expects to introduce additional phonecells during fiscal year the most significant new fwt is the sx gsm fwt 
the sx gsm unit includes a transceiver that was designed by the company  as well as  the company s asic chip 
the asic chip replaces some electronic components and a circuit board  which significantly reduces the cost from the predecessor version 
the company has been negotiating licenses with a number of large international telecommunications companies 
the company has agreed to provide component circuit boards to qualcomm incorporated 
during fiscal year  the company agreed to license certain technologies to ericsson radio systems ab and to nokia mobile phone ltd

cash used for operations was million for the year ended september   compared to million of cash provided for the same period in  due primarily to the increased operating loss 
cash used for capital expenditures and other investing activities was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the same fiscal period last year

in  the company used million of cash to increase its equity position in wireless domain  inc financing activities provided million during fiscal year  compared to million during fiscal year in the fiscal year amount includes proceeds to the company of million resulting from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock 
in  the company entered into a loan and security agreement with sanwa business credit corporation that  among other things  provides a credit facility with a loan limit of million the loan 
borrowings under the loan are subject to borrowing base requirements and other restrictions 
under the loan and security agreement  the company is required to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants 
the loan matures on april  as of september   the company s borrowing capacity under the loan provisions was million although there have been no borrowings and none are contemplated in the near term 
the company will use the loan  as necessary  to provide working capital to support very large orders 
in  the company issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock for million that is net of issuance cost of million 
the preferred stock automatically converts to common stock on april   or october   depending on the conversion price and includes the equivalent of a annual stock dividend 
holders of the preferred stock are entitled  at their option  subject to trading volume and other restrictions  to convert preferred stock into shares of common stock using defined conversion formulas based on the nasdaq closing bid prices for the company s common stock 
holders of the preferred stock are not entitled to vote on matters submitted for vote to the stockholders of the company 
as of september    shares of preferred stock had been converted into  shares of common stock 
the company is using much of the capital raised from the preferred stock offering to fund new product development 
beyond its specific research and product development needs  expected future uses of cash include working capital requirements  marketing and sales support programs in anticipation of future revenues and certain capital expenditures 
based upon its current operating plan  the company believes its existing capital resources  including the credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  should enable it to maintain its current and planned operations through fiscal year cash requirements may vary and are difficult to predict given the nature of the developing markets targeted by the company 
the amount of royalty income from the company s licensees is unpredictable  but could have an impact on the company s actual cash flow 
the company requires letters of credit or qualification for export credit insurance underwritten by third party credit insurance companies or the export import bank of the united states on a substantial portion of its international sales orders 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company endeavors to conduct all of its international transactions in us dollars 
to date  the company s sales have not been adversely affected by currency fluctuations  however  as the company s international operations grow  foreign exchange or the inflation of a foreign currency may pose greater risks for the company  and the company may be required to develop and implement additional strategies to manage these risks 
from october   until november  the last practicable date  the price for the company s common stock has closed in the range of to per share 
on november   the company received notification from nasdaq that the company has a day period to bring itself back into compliance with the nasdaq s rules  which require  among other things  that listed companies maintain a minimum stock price per share of one dollar 
on october   the company announced that its board of directors will seek shareholder approval at its annual shareholder meeting on january   to effect a reverse stock split 
by effectuating a reverse stock split  the company expects to raise its share price above one dollar and bring itself back into compliance with this listing requirement 
if the company s stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market system  it would continue to be traded over the counter  but the delisting would likely adversely affect the attractiveness of the stock to many investors  including many institutional investors 
in addition  delisting of the stock would give rise to a right on the part of the holders of the company s series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock to redeem their preferred stock at a redemption price per share equal to the greater of i  and ii the product of the conversion rate at the time of delisting and the closing bid price immediately prior to that date 
as of november    shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
impact of the year issue recently  national attention has focused on the potential problems and associated costs resulting from computer programs that have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs treat all years as occurring between and and do not self correct to reflect the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year management has conducted a formal assessment of its significant information technology systems  including computers used in its production and manufacturing functions 
based upon this assessment  management believes that only minor modifications will be required to its internal software and hardware imbedded chips so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the cost of such modifications  including testing and implementation  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and will be funded through operating cash flows 
the company expects to complete the implementation final phase of changes to its internal computer systems by january   however  there can be no assurance that such schedule will be met 
the company does not conduct any of its purchase transactions through computer systems that interface directly with suppliers 
the company has also initiated a formal assessment of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company would be vulnerable if those third parties fail to remedy year issues 
to date  the company has received written responses from approximately  of its  suppliers 
the company has evaluated these responses and is now monitoring the progress of suppliers that are not fully ready for the year where the company determines that critical suppliers will not be ready for the year  the company will take appropriate actions 
with respect to its customers  the company currently has no material systems that interface directly with customers 
further  the company has not entered into any significant supply contracts that extend beyond september  the company s large customers beyond december  will likely be new customers due to the project nature of its business 
in addition  as a global company that operates in many different countries  some of which may not be addressing the year problem as aggressively as the united states  there can be no assurances that future customers will be year compliant 
moreover  because markets for the company s products are dependent on third parties  such as wireless local loop network providers  management cannot fully assess the impact that the year problem will have on future sales 
the company has reviewed each of its product lines and has determined that its products will operate properly in the year and beyond 
however  for some industries  the company s products are integrated with other company s products and sold as a combined product 
there can be no assurances that such combined products  current and future  will operate properly in the year and beyond 
the cost of the company s efforts to prepare for the year which is estimated at  including approximately  spent to date  and the date on which the company believes it will complete its internal year compliance efforts  reflect management s current estimates based upon available information 
management will continue to monitor this issue  particularly the possible impact of third party year compliance on the company s operations  and will modify its estimates if warranted 
management believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve its internal year issues in a timely manner 
nevertheless  because it is not possible to anticipate all future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company is adversely effected by year problems 
the loss of revenue from such occurrences has not been estimated 
forward looking information statements contained in this filing  other than historical statements  consist of forward looking information 
the company s actual results may vary considerably from those discussed in this filing as a result of various risks and uncertainties 
for example  there are a number of uncertainties as to the degree and duration of the revenue momentum  which could impact the company s ability to be profitable as lower sales may likely result in lower margins 
in addition  product development expenditures  which are expected to benefit future periods  are likely to have a negative impact on near term earnings 
other risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in exhibit to this filing  include the risk that technological change will render the company s technology obsolete  the risk of litigation  the company s ability to develop new product  the company s dependence on contractors and motorola  the company s ability to maintain quality control  the risk of doing business in developing markets  the company s dependence on research and development  the uncertainty of additional funding  the potential for redemption of preferred stock  the effects of control by existing shareholders  global economic conditions  intense industry competition  the uncertainty in the development of wireless service generally  and the risk that the company s common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market system for failure to increase its stock price over one dollar
