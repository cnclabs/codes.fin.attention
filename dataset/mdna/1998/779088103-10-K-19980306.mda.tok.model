item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements which begin on page rouge steel company rouge steel and its subsidiaries were reorganized into a holding company structure effective july  pursuant to the reorganization  rouge steel became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new holding company  rouge industries  inc  a delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries  rouge industries or the company 
rouge industries  which was incorporated in  is the issuer of all shares of class a common stock and class b common stock outstanding 
on the reorganization date  rouge industries and its subsidiaries had the same consolidated net worth as rouge steel and its subsidiaries prior to the reorganization 
rouge steel is an integrated producer of high quality  flat rolled steel products consisting of hot rolled  cold rolled and electrogalvanized steel 
in recent years  the company has emphasized the production of value added flat rolled carbon steel products that require additional processing and generally command higher margins than commodity flat rolled carbon steel products 
the company s products generally  and its value added products specifically  are sold primarily to customers in the automotive industry which have exacting quality  delivery and service requirements 
the company also sells its products to steel converters  service centers and other end users 
other wholly owned subsidiaries of rouge industries are qs steel inc qs steel and eveleth taconite company eveleth 
qs steel holds minority ownership interests in five michigan based joint ventures 
eveleth holds a interest in eveleth mines llc evtac  a minnesota based iron ore mining and pellet producing operation 
since the acquisition of the company from ford motor company ford in the acquisition  rouge industries current management has transformed the company from an adjunct to ford s automotive manufacturing business into an independent  market driven business 
in order to strengthen relationships with existing customers and establish relationships with new customers  the company has focused on a number of strategies designed to improve the quality of its products  increase the efficiency of its operations  reduce operating expenses and improve its product mix  including increased sales of higher margin value added steel products 
the company has reported net income every year since the acquisition except when the impact of changes in accounting principles resulted in a million loss 
in the eight years since the acquisition  rouge industries has undertaken a capital investment program designed to improve quality  product mix and productivity 
in  the company and united states steel corporation expanded the capacity of double eagle steel coating company double eagle  which permits rouge industries to produce an additional  net tons of value added electrogalvanized steel product annually 
in  the company partially relined its larger blast furnace and launched the second ladle refining facility and the third strand of its continuous caster 
these additions permit the company to refine and continuously cast of its liquid steel  eliminate the need to utilize the higher cost  lower quality ingot process and produce a greater proportion of value added steel 
in  the company installed a new raw material handling system  finished a major reline of its smaller blast furnace and upgraded its hot and cold mill facilities 
additionally  the company invested in spartan steel coating  llc spartan steel  a owned joint venture with worthington industries  inc together with its subsidiaries  worthington 
rouge steel s operations are subject to the cyclicality of the steel industry and the domestic economy as a whole 
during the last major downturn in the steel industry  domestic steel industry production fell to approximately million tons in from an annual average during the prior three year period of approximately million tons  a decrease of approximately 
this decrease was due primarily to a deterioration of general economic conditions and decreased demand for durable goods 
for instance  the production of domestic cars and trucks in fell to million units from an annual average during the prior three year period of million units 
consistent with these trends in the steel industry  the company s raw steel production in fell to million tons from an average of million tons during the prior three year period 
commencing in december  the steel industry experienced a recovery in raw steel production and finished shipments 
production and shipments continued an upward trend through the industry s domestic raw steel production increased approximately to approximately million tons in from million tons in finished shipments increased over the same period to approximately million tons from million tons  an increase of approximately 
given the inherent cyclicality of the domestic steel industry  the company believes it is important to maintain financial flexibility in order to take advantage of opportunities to reduce costs and upgrade the quality and mix of its products 
rouge industries believes that its strong balance sheet combined with its plan to reduce operating costs will position the company to continue to pursue its business strategy throughout the economic cycle and to respond to the continually changing needs of its customers 
the following table summarizes the annual raw steel capacity  raw steel production  utilization rates and finished shipment information for the domestic steel industry as reported by the american iron and steel institute and for rouge steel for the years from through year ended december in millions of tons except utilization domestic industry raw steel capacity raw steel production utilization finished shipments rouge steel raw steel capacity raw steel production utilization finished shipments the cyclicality of the steel industry and the domestic economy affects the company s steel product prices 
to protect itself from the volatile nature of prices in the domestic steel industry  the company sells approximately two thirds of its steel products pursuant to fixed price contracts  under which prices are typically set annually 
in  when domestic steel industry production and shipments were low  the company s steel product prices reached a nine year low 
in  prices began to rise and in they reached the highest level since by mid  however  prices began to soften despite the continuing strong demand for the company s products 
during the second half of  the company lost approximately one half of the pricing gains which it realized in and prices in made a modest recovery from late levels  but nevertheless remained lower than average prices 
in  prices declined slightly from levels despite strong demand for the company s products 
total sales 
the company s total sales are a function of net tons shipped  prices and mix of products 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the company s steel product revenues represented by each of its product types for each of the years from through year ended december hot rolled cold rolled hot dip galvanized electrogalvanized total during periods of high demand  the company ships all of the steel products it has the capacity to produce 
for the past two years  when demand for the company s products was high  the company was able to supplement slabs produced internally with purchased slabs 
the company has been  and intends to continue  increasing its capacity so it will be positioned to take advantage of any increased demand with only a limited number of purchased slabs 
in order to more fully utilize its hot strip mill and finishing facilities  the company has been increasing its steel slab production capability 
in  rouge steel placed into service the third strand of its continuous caster  which allows the company to continuously cast of its liquid steel and eliminates the need to utilize the higher cost  lower quality ingot process 
to maximize the continuous caster s capability  the company further increased blast furnace efficiency and capacity by the addition of a new raw material handling system and the full reline of its smaller b blast furnace during the relines of b and c furnaces in and  respectively  together with the addition of the raw material handling system  are expected to increase annual blast furnace capacity to approximately million net tons or approximately over the annualized second quarter level before any of these improvements were made 
as a result of placing the third strand of the continuous caster into service and increasing blast furnace capacity  the company believes that its steel slab production capacity will increase to approximately million net tons annually 
in addition to increasing finished capacity  the company intends to continue to improve product mix by increasing the capacity of its value added facilities 
for example  the expansion of double eagle in allowed rouge steel to increase shipments of value added electrogalvanized steel products 
total shipments will not necessarily increase  but they are expected to include a higher proportion of value added products 
likewise  the company s expenditures on joint ventures will not necessarily allow total shipments to increase  but by permitting the company to produce additional coated and blanked steel products  the joint ventures are expected to improve rouge industries product mix 
approximately two thirds of the company s total sales are made pursuant to fixed price contracts primarily with automotive customers  under which prices are typically set annually 
sales to affiliates are comprised primarily of sales to worthington  rouge industries second largest customer and shareholder 
worthington owns approximately of the company s common stock which represents a voting interest of 
costs of goods sold 
the principal elements constituting rouge industries costs of goods sold are raw materials  labor and energy 
outside processing costs represent a growing element of the company s costs of goods sold 
the major raw materials and energy used by the company in its production process are coke  iron ore pellets  steel scrap  natural gas  electricity  steam  oxygen and nitrogen 
coke  coal  iron ore pellets  electricity  steam  oxygen and nitrogen predominantly are purchased pursuant to long term or annual agreements 
the other raw materials are generally purchased in the open market from various sources and their availability and price are subject to market conditions 
iron ore pellets are purchased from evtac pursuant to a six year pellet purchase agreement 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  eveleth  holds a interest in evtac 
rouge steel s hourly production and maintenance employees are represented by the international union  united automobile  aerospace and argicultrual implement workers of america  uaw and are working under a labor contract which expires on august  the collective bargaining agreement  which has a term of five years  contains no provision to renegotiate prior to its expiration 
outside processing costs  which are principally costs for value added processing that the company cannot perform at rouge steel s integrated facility  have always been an element of the company s costs of goods sold 
the joint ventures involving rouge industries will increase the use of outside processing and related costs 
however  rouge industries believes that the incremental revenue generated from additional sales of value added products produced by the joint ventures will exceed such cost increases 
a large component of the company s costs of goods sold in and was the purchase of steel slabs to augment its own production as a result of demand and blast furnace reline related outages 
in  the company purchased approximately  net tons of steel slabs  and during  the company purchased approximately  net tons of steel slabs 
in  assuming blast furnace production improves as anticipated  the company plans to purchase only a limited number of steel slabs 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  total sales 
total sales increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
the increase in total sales was caused principally by higher shipments 
shipments increased in to  net tons from  net tons in  an increase of  net tons 
shipments were higher in because the company was able to add new customers and increase sales to its existing customers 
the company purchased approximately  net tons of slabs in to augment its own production and accommodate the demand for its products 
the higher revenue caused by increased shipments was partially offset by lower steel product selling prices 
total sales per net ton shipped decreased in to from in  a decrease of per ton 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
costs of goods sold increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
the increase in costs of goods sold can be attributed primarily to the increase in shipments discussed above  higher purchased slab prices and increased project expense for blast furnace stove repairs  the takeover of rouge steel s internal railroad from ford and demolition and site preparation expenses related to the new raw material handling system 
several factors partially offset the costs of goods sold increase i non capital expenditures associated with the reline of the smaller b blast furnace were lower in than non capital expenditures associated with the reline of the c blast furnace in  ii the c furnace performed more efficiently in post reline than it did when it was nearing the end of its campaign in  and iii the full year effect of efficiencies gained from the launch in mid of the third caster strand which allowed the company to eliminate the more costly ingot slab process 
costs of goods sold was of total sales in  down slightly from of total sales in depreciation and amortization increased in to million from million in  an increase of million 
the higher depreciation and amortization expense reflects the completion of major capital projects  primarily the full year effect of the third strand of the company s continuous caster 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower legal expenses and michigan single business tax 
operating income 
primarily as a result of the efficiencies discussed above  including costs related to the b furnace reline  the improved productivity of c furnace and the full year effect of the third strand of the caster  offset partially by lower steel product selling prices  operating income increased in to million from million in  an increase of million 
operating income represented of total sales in  up from of total sales in interest income 
interest income decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in interest income was the result of a lower cash and marketable securities balance in the average cash and marketable securities balance in was million compared to million in equity in income loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries was  in compared to equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries of  in the loss in reflects the after tax effect of rouge industries share of losses incurred by shiloh of michigan and evtac as well as preproduction expenses recorded by spartan steel 
the income in reflects the after tax effect of the company s share of shiloh of michigan s losses offset by one month s income generated by evtac 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total sales 
total sales increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
the increase in total sales was caused principally by higher shipments 
shipments increased in to  net tons from  net tons in  an increase of  net tons 
shipments were higher in because the company was able to add new customers and increase sales to its existing customers 
rouge steel purchased  net tons of slabs in to augment its own production and accommodate the demand for its products 
the effect of higher shipments on total sales was partially offset by lower steel prices in total sales per net ton shipped decreased in to from in  a decrease of per ton 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
costs of goods sold increased in to  million from  million in  an increase of million 
the increase in costs of goods sold can be attributed primarily to four elements i increased shipments of steel products  ii higher raw material  utility and labor costs  iii the blast furnace reline and other blast furnace problems  and iv the purchased slabs discussed above 
in the first quarter of  the larger of the company s two operating blast furnaces  c furnace  experienced lining related operating problems 
a partial reline of c furnace was completed in the fourth quarter of the newly relined blast furnace experienced start up problems which delayed production for several days and had a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
costs of goods sold was of total sales in compared to of total sales in depreciation and amortization increased in to million from million in  an increase of million 
the higher depreciation and amortization expense reflects the completion of major capital projects  primarily the third strand of the company s continuous caster 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to three factors i lower michigan single business tax  which is a function of the company s lower taxable income in  ii lower profit sharing paid to the company s administrative employees  which is also a function of the company s lower taxable income  and iii less expense recorded for the development of the company s customer order management system 
in  the company reached an agreement with the city of dearborn  the dearborn public school board and the county of wayne  michigan which settled local property tax litigation for tax years through as a result of the settlement  the company recorded a pre tax benefit of million in  net of profit sharing and inventory valuation costs 
operating income 
primarily as a result of the lower steel prices  the higher costs of goods sold discussed above  including costs related to the blast furnace outages and related production problems  and the absence of the property tax litigation settlement  which was recorded as a benefit in  operating income decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
operating income represented of total sales in compared to of total sales in excluding the impact of the property tax litigation settlement in  operating income represented of total sales 
the margin deterioration in was attributable primarily to three factors i higher raw material  utility and labor costs  ii the blast furnace outages and related blast furnace problems  and iii lower steel prices 
operating income per net ton shipped was in compared to in income tax provision 
the income tax provision decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
the lower income tax provision was a function of lower taxable income in minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary decreased in to  from  in  a change of  this change reflects lower costs resulting from increased rail shipments directly from eveleth 
until november   eveleth was owned by the company and owned by oglebay norton company oglebay 
the minority interest reflects oglebay s share of eveleth s earnings or losses 
effective december   under the terms of a restructuring agreement  eveleth became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and  in exchange for a ownership interest in evtac  eveleth assigned substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities to evtac 
in the future  the impact of the company s ownership interest in evtac will be accounted for under the equity method and rouge industries consolidated statements of operations will not show any minority interest relating to evtac 
equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries was  in compared to in the amount in reflects the after tax effect of the company s share of shiloh of michigan s losses offset by one month s income generated by evtac 
there was no income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the company acquired its interest in shiloh of michigan during and  as previously discussed  treated eveleth as a consolidated subsidiary until late net income 
net income decreased in to million from million in  a decrease of million 
the lower net income in reflects lower steel prices  higher costs of goods sold and the absence of the one time property tax litigation settlement that was recorded in  partially offset by a lower income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources rouge industries liquidity needs arise predominantly from capital investments and working capital requirements 
the company meets these liquidity needs primarily with cash provided by operating activities and funds provided by borrowings 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on december  totalled million compared to million on december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to cash used for capital spending and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in to million from million in  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily the result of lower inventories 
the decrease in inventories was primarily a result of a reduction of steel product inventories 
late in  production was low due to the blast furnace outages and poor operating performance by c furnace 
at the same time  the company was shipping a high level of steel products 
the combination of low production and high shipments caused the company s inventories to decrease 
additionally  the company had stockpiled slabs at december  in anticipation of the b blast furnace reline in many of those slabs were used in contributing further to the reduction in inventories 
credit facility 
rouge steel has a five year  million  unsecured revolving loan commitment under a credit agreement the credit agreement among the company  the banks named therein and nbd bank  as administrative agent 
the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement expire on december  the revolving loans provided for under the credit agreement bear interest  at the option of the company  at a rate equal to either i the base rate  which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or ii the libor rate plus an applicable margin  which varies with the company s debt to capitalization ratio and can range from to 
the company had borrowings of million under the facility as of december  the company believes that net income and funds available under the credit agreement will be adequate for its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures  including investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  increased in to million from million in  an increase of million 
the most significant of the expenditures made in were for the completion of an automated raw material handling system and investment in spartan steel 
additionally  the company incurred capital expenditures in for the full reline of its b blast furnace 
the remaining expenditures were made primarily to upgrade and modernize the company s steel processing facilities 
during the five year period commencing january   the company anticipates spending approximately million on capital items and investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries  including million paid or accrued in and million paid or accrued in the planned capital expenditures are generally directed at improving and maintaining plant efficiency and quality to position the company to improve its competitive position in the marketplace and  to a lesser extent  to enter into strategic joint ventures 
in  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital items and investment in joint ventures including information systems upgrades and the completion of spartan steel 
during  the company expects to invest approximately million in spartan steel  which is expected to be placed into service in mid waste oxide reclamation facility lease 
rouge steel has committed to a seven year lease for a million waste oxide reclamation facility 
the facility is presently being constructed  and it is expected to be completed in the third quarter of lease payments will commence at that time 
future environmental matters the company s operations are subject to many federal  state and local laws  regulations  permits and consent agreements relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
the company believes that its facilities are in material compliance with these laws and provisions and does not believe that liabilities arising out of existing environmental conditions or future compliance with environmental laws  regulations  permits and consent requirements will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the company has incurred capital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental control of approximately million during the past four years 
in addition  the company has planned approximately million in capital expenditures for environmental compliance for the years through ford has agreed to indemnify the company the ford indemnity for any liability arising out of an environmental condition existing prior to the acquisition or a subsequent change in law relating to such condition which results in an environmental claim under any federal or state environmental law  including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the clean air act and the occupational safety and health act of the ford indemnity  which terminates on december   provides that ford shall pay the company s liabilities  including any penalties and attorney s fees  in connection with any environmental claim relating to pre acquisition conditions 
since environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  the company s environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future 
in addition  due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments  the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated 
year compliance the widespread use of computer programs that rely on two digit date programs to perform computations and decision making functions may cause computer systems to malfunction in the year which could lead to business delays and manufacturing disruptions 
rouge industries has not completed its assessment of the extent of the year issue  however  management has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will property utilize dates beyond december  the company has begun modifying and replacing its computer systems to address this issue and estimates that at least million will be spent to modify software and computer systems that are not year compliant
