while the company enrolls students throughout the year  second quarter december to february average enrollments and related revenues generally are lower than other quarters due to the holiday breaks in december and january 
second quarter costs and expenses historically increase as a percentage of net revenues as a result of certain fixed costs not significantly affected by the seasonal second quarter declines in net revenues 
the company experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollments in august of each year when most other colleges and universities begin their fall semesters 
as a result  instruction costs and services and selling and promotional expenses historically increase as a percentage of net revenues in the fourth quarter due to increased costs in preparation for the august peak enrollments

the company anticipates that these seasonal trends in the second and fourth quarters will continue in the future

the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the general growth in operations as well as the implementation in the fourth quarter of new financial aid processing software

as of august   the company had approximately million in these separate accounts  which are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash  to comply with these requirements 
these funds generally remain in these separate accounts for an average of days from the date of collection 
these restrictions on cash have not affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
the title iv regulations  as revised effective july   require all higher education institutions to meet a minimum composite score to be deemed financially responsible by the doe 
if the minimum composite score of is not met  an institution would fall under alternative standards and may lose its eligibility to participate in title iv programs

uop s most recent department of education program review began in march  and an initial program review report has been received 
this report contained six findings in the areas of satisfactory academic progress  refunds and general program administration 
uop is currently in the process of responding to these findings regarding compliance with requirements of the title iv programs 
uop s response to these issues is due in january  and uop will have its response prepared prior to the deadline 
subsequently  the department will issue a final program review determination 
it is uncertain when the final determination will be issued and what the results of the findings will be 
additionally  in january the department of education office of the inspector general oig began performing a routine audit of uop 
the auditors reviewed uop s cash management policies 
although no draft report has been received from the oig  the audit team indicated at the exit interview that it had no findings regarding cash management policies 
the team did present questions regarding uop s interpretation of the hour rule  uop s distance education programs and institutional refund obligations 
as of this date  uop has supplied the oig with the information they have requested and is awaiting an initial draft report 
although the company believes that the program review and oig audit will be resolved without any material effect  as with any program review or audit  no assurance can be given as to the final outcome since the matters are not yet resolved 
as previously disclosed  the company assumed the title iv liabilities of western international university western which were subject to change based on the results of the doe s audit of western s title iv programs 
although much of the fieldwork was completed in early  the final audit results and the amount that the company is responsible for has not been determined by the doe at the current time 
depending on the interpretation of the various regulatory requirements  the final audit results and the company s liability may differ materially from the estimates currently recorded 
any difference between the final amount and the estimates currently recorded will be recorded as an increase or decrease  as applicable  to expense 
as previously disclosed  the company began offering an alternative student loan program on a test basis at several of its campuses in march in may  this pilot program was discontinued

year compliance the year computer issue refers to a condition in computer software where a two digit field rather than a four digit field is used to distinguish a calendar year 
unless corrected  some computer programs  hardware it and non information technology systems non it could be unable to process information containing dates subsequent to december  as a result  such programs and systems could experience miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions 
the company is currently in the assessment phase of evaluating its core business information systems for year readiness and is extending that review to include a wide variety of other it and non it systems 
as a result of hardware and software upgrades and computer system purchases over the past few years  many of the company s computer systems should not have a year problem or have been warranted to be year compliant by third party vendors 
the company is continuing the process of updating much of its existing software for year compliance by acquiring new and upgraded third party software packages to replace existing software and modifying existing internally developed software 
in no case is a system being replaced solely because of year issues  although in some cases  the timing of system replacements is being accelerated 
sufficient testing of the company s it systems has not been completed to fully validate readiness 
additional testing is planned during to reasonably ensure year compliance 
additionally  while the company may have incurred an opportunity cost for addressing the year issue  it does not believe that any specific it projects have been deferred as a result of its year efforts 
the company s non it compliance is focused primarily in the area of facilities leased by the company 
the company is working with its lessors to ensure compliance on these non it systems 
the company has begun to assess the readiness of its significant suppliers  business partners  banking agencies and governmental agencies to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly remediate their own year issues 
the company s operations and liquidity largely depend upon the student funding provided by title iv programs for its students 
processing of applications for this funding is handled by the us department of education s computers systems 
the us department of education has stated that its systems will be year compliant in early calendar year and that various schools will be able to run tests of the remediated systems during the first half of calendar year  however  the company is unable to independently assess the us department of education s progress to date and no test dates have been announced yet 
similarly  uop  ipd  wiu  the college and ipd client institutions are licensed by one or more agencies in the states in which they are based and are accredited by accrediting bodies that are recognized by the us department of education 
any prolonged interruption would have a material adverse impact upon the education industry and  accordingly  upon the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company is in the process of developing an appropriate contingency plan in the event that a significant exposure is identified relative to the dependencies on third party systems 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the year issue would be that the company or the third parties with whom it has relationships would cease or not successfully complete their year remediation efforts 
if this were to occur  the company would encounter disruptions to its business that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company could be materially impacted by widespread economic or financial market disruption or by year computer system failures at the us department of education 
the company has not at this time established a formal year contingency plan but will consider and  if necessary  address doing so as part of its year activities 
although the company is unable at this time to assess the possible impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition of any year related disruptions to its business caused by the malfunctioning of any it or non it systems and products that it uses or that third parties with which it has material relationships use  management does not believe at the current time that the cost of remediating the company s internal year problems will have a material adverse impact upon its business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s historical operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s portfolio of marketable securities includes numerous issuers  varying types of securities and maturities 
the company intends to hold these securities to maturity 
the fair value of the company s portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
