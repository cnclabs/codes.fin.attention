the average earning asset mix shifted moderately in with loans at percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale at percent and other earning assets at percent 
in  loans were percent  investment securities and investment securities available for sale were percent and other earning assets were percent  unchanged from levels 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a position to react to interest rate movements and to maximize the return on earning assets 
loans average loans increased percent in with much of the increase concentrated in commercial  financial and agricultural loans  real estate construction loans and consumer installment loans 
total loans outstanding at year end increased percent over previous year end levels 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans  which were percent of total loans  increased percent in compared to the previous year 
real estate construction loans increased percent while consumer installment loans increased percent from year end to year end residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans each increased one percent compared to levels 
the percent increase in the company s loan portfolio from to was primarily the result of an increase of percent in commercial  financial and agricultural loans and a percent increase in residential mortgage loans 
the company s loan portfolio continues to reflect the diversity of the markets served by the subsidiary banks 
the condition of the economy in states in which the subsidiary banks lend money is further reflected in the loan portfolio mix 
the volume of commercial  financial and agricultural loans  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  increased significantly during continuing the trend of prior years 
residential real estate loans represented percent of the total portfolio at december   down from the percent reported in the prior year 
the company has not invested in loans that would be considered highly leveraged transactions as defined by the federal reserve and other regulatory agencies 
the company had no foreign loans or loans to lesser developed countries as of december  the loan portfolio table shows the classifications of loans by major category at december   and for each of the preceding four years

securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
on december   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities special report 
the special report allowed a company the one time opportunity to reassess the appropriateness of its investment securities classifications and to transfer securities from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio without calling into question the company s intent to hold other debt securities to maturity 
upon adoption  the company transferred held to maturity investment securities totaling million to its available for sale portfolio and million of available for sale securities to its held to maturity portfolio 
generally  individual holdings with greater than million par value were transferred to the available for sale portfolio in order to increase liquidity and portfolio management capabilities  with smaller positions transferred to the held to maturity portfolio 
the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
for securities classified as held to maturity  the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
certain securities that may be sold prior to maturity are reflected as investment securities available for sale on the company s balance sheet 
maturities of held to maturity securities in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during  gross gains of million were realized on million of mortgage backed securities mbs in the held to maturity portfolio  which were classified as maturities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
sales and maturities of securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively  in while sales and maturities in the portfolio in were million and million 
net gains realized during the year accounted for four percent  six percent and two percent of noninterest income in  and  respectively 
gross unrealized gains in the company s held to maturity portfolio at year end totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled million 
in recent years  the trend of the company has been to invest in taxable securities due to the lack of preferential treatment afforded tax exempt securities under the tax laws 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
total average investment securities  including those available for sale  was relatively unchanged during after increasing percent in the following table contains the carrying amount of the investment securities portfolio at the end of each of the last three years

during a period of rising rates  prepayment speeds generally slow on mbs and cmos with a resulting extension in average life  and vice versa 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
similarly  given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were percent and percent  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life as well as the decreased market yield on fixed rate securities and impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities 
the opposite is generally true during a period of falling rates 
at december   fixed rate mbs and cmos totaled million and billion  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
adjustable rate mbs and cmos totaled million and million  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
substantially all adjustable rate mbs and cmos are subject to life rate caps  and mbs are also generally subject to a two percent annual cap 
the weighted average life caps at year end were percent and percent for mbs and cmos  respectively  and the corresponding weighted average coupon rates at year end were percent and percent 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and  respectively 
trading account securities and other earning assets securities carried in the trading account  while interest bearing  are primarily held for sale 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account securities portfolio for increased by percent following a percent increase in  as a result of increased retail sales demand and a larger  more experienced sales force

in addition  the mix of average interest bearing deposits in shifted from demand deposits to savings due primarily to a program initiated by the company during under this program  deposit balances in certain now accounts above a certain threshold are transferred to savings accounts  thereby reducing the level of deposit reserves required to be maintained with the federal reserve 
see note  cash and due from banks  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of reserve requirements maintained with the federal reserve 
as a result of this program  during and now account balances averaging million and million  respectively  were transferred to the savings category 
contributing to the change in the mix of interest bearing liabilities in was a three percent decrease in average certificates of deposit less than  and other time deposits  offset in part by a one percent increase in average certificates of deposit of  or more 
during  the increase in average interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities from the prior year was the result of increases in all interest bearing deposit categories 
savings deposits and certificates of deposit of  or more increased percent and percent  respectively  while demand deposits and certificates of deposit less than  and other time deposits showed more modest increases of percent and percent  respectively 
the increases during were due primarily to internally generated growth with a portion of the increase due to merger and acquisition related activity 
the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit over deposits over   total in thousands three months or less    over three through six months    over six through twelve months   over twelve months   in order to support earning asset growth of nine percent in and as a result of consumers choosing alternative investments other than deposits  the company relied more heavily on borrowed funds in borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the parent company s commercial paper 
average federal funds purchased increased million  or percent  and other short term borrowings increased million  or percent  while average securities sold under agreements to repurchase showed a slight decrease of percent during during  the average balance of fhlb and other borrowings increased million  or percent  primarily as a result of additional fhlb advances of billion  partially offset by repayments of million 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  the company supplemented its funding sources through the formation of a statutory business trust compass trust i which issued capital securities capital securities to institutional investors in the amount of million 
the proceeds from the issuance of the capital securities and the issuance of million of common securities were concurrently used by compass trust i to purchase million of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
the average balance of the capital securities is included in fhlb and other borrowings in the tables on pages and for a further discussion of capital securities  refer to note  capital securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the short term borrowings table below shows the distribution of the company s short term borrowed funds and the weighted average interest rates thereon at the end of each of the last three years

liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of the subsidiary banks customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the subsidiary banks would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
additionally  the parent holding company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to the subsidiary banks  the servicing of debt and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent holding company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent holding company in the amount of million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the parent holding company has access to various capital markets as evidenced by the issuance of the capital securities during the first quarter of and the issuance of subordinated debentures in and the parent holding company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only to assure adequate liquidity in order for the subsidiary banks to meet the needs of their customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
in a banking environment  both assets and liabilities are considered sources of liquidity funding and are monitored on a daily basis 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
as disclosed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million primarily due to the increase in other assets offset by an increase in net income and trading account securities 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of net loans originated of million and available for sale securities purchased of billion  largely funded by maturities of investment securities held to maturity of million  as well as sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the million of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a net increase of million in fhlb advances and other borrowings  a million increase in federal funds purchased  an increase of million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the issuance of million in capital securities offset partially by a reduction of million in deposits and the payment of million in dividends 
interest rate sensitivity management the company s net interest income  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets at least monthly and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company and the subsidiary banks 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon is shown below 
such analysis assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  no balance sheet growth and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts will reprice in each scenario 
percentage increase decrease principal notional in interest income expense amount of earning given immediate and sustained assets  interest parallel interest rate shifts bearing liabilities and swaps at down up december  basis points basis points in thousands assets which reprice in one year or less  over one year  liabilities which reprice in one year or less  over one year  non trading swaps  total net interest income sensitivity the alco policy  with which the company complies  is based on the same assumptions as the above table and provides that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not reduce net interest income by more than five percent 
certain financial instruments have been excluded from the above analysis because of the no growth assumption  including letters of credit and commitments to extend credit 
trading account interest rate contracts and options and non trading caps purchased have also been excluded because they have no material impact on net interest income 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor and interest rate caps and floors purchased or written where the company receives or pays  respectively  interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps and floors and gains or losses in futures contracts classified as hedges are ultimately reflected as adjustments to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate protection contracts are not reflected in the financial statements until realized 
a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations in off balance sheet financial instruments is included in note  derivative financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

weighted average rates received paid are shown only for swaps  caps and floors for which net interest amounts were receivable or payable at december the net interest amount received or paid on an interest rate protection contract represents an adjustment of the yield or rate on the respective asset or liability with which such contract is associated 
the gain or loss on a terminated interest rate protection contract is deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the original contract as an adjustment of yield or rate on the asset or liability with which the original contract was associated 
at year end  there were no deferred gains and  of deferred losses on terminated interest rate protection contracts  which will be recorded as net interest expense through the following table indicates the asset or liability category with which the non trading interest rate protection contracts were associated at december  assets liabilities associated with interest rate protection contracts notional principal associated with total notional investment certificates federal funds fhlb subordinated principal securities loans of deposit purchased advances debentures in thousands swaps pay fixed     receive fixed     basis swaps    caps purchased   in addition to interest rate protection contracts used to manage overall interest sensitivity  the company also enters into interest rate contracts for the trading account 
the primary purposes for using interest rate protection contracts in the trading account are to facilitate customer transactions and to protect cash market positions in the trading account against interest rate movement 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions 
net interest amounts received or paid on interest rate contracts in the trading account are recorded as an adjustment of interest on trading account securities

positive carrying values represent assets of the company while negative amounts represent liabilities 
in addition to the interest rate contracts shown above  the company uses other options and futures in the trading account 
at december   the trading account contained other options purchased and written having weighted average expiration dates shorter than three months  with a notional balance of million for purchased options and a notional balance of million for written options and estimated fair values of  and  respectively 
changes in the estimated fair value of these instruments are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions 
the position of purchased options was taken in order to protect the market value of the trading account against rising short term interest rates while maintaining limited risk to declining rates 
at december   futures contracts having a notional principal of million were also used to reduce the price sensitivity of the trading account 
capital resources shareholders equity increased percent in after increasing percent in exclusive of the net change in unrealized holding gains losses on securities available for sale in both and  net income after dividends accounted for substantially all of the increase in shareholders equity 
dividends of million were declared on the company s common stock in  representing a percent increase over the annual dividend rate per common share  after adjusting for a three for two stock split effected in the form of a percent stock dividend paid in april   was  an percent increase over the dividend payout ratio for was percent compared to percent for and percent for the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
on february   the company s board of directors approved an percent increase in the annual dividend rate  raising it to per common share for this marked the seventeenth consecutive year the company has increased its dividend 
a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through reinvested earnings 
average shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in as noted above  exclusive of the net change in unrealized holding gains losses on securities available for sale  the increase in shareholders equity in and is due almost exclusively to the retention of earnings 
in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off of the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus the capital securities  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled million and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end  up from percent and percent at year end these ratios are well within the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased in primarily as a result of the issuance of the capital securities in january   and the million in earnings retained by the company  net of dividends 
while shareholders equity increased percent from december   to december   the increases in tier i and total qualifying capital were significantly less due to the addition of million in intangibles resulting from the company s purchase business combinations in two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted quarterly average assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed intangibles 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
even though core deposit intangibles and goodwill increased due to purchase business combinations completed during and  the leverage ratio remained well within regulatory guidelines percent at year end  percent at year end and percent at year end the tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end  percent at year end and percent at year end the increase in both the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio in was due primarily to the issuance of the capital securities in january   while the decrease in of these ratios was due primarily to the substantial increase in intangibles resulting from the purchase business combinations completed by the company in the following table shows the calculation of capital ratios for the company for the last three years

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased percent over while increasing percent in over a nine percent increase in the volume of average earning assets  primarily total loans  coupled with a three basis point increase in the net yield were responsible for the increase in in  an percent increase in the volume of earning assets  primarily as a result of a percent increase in both total investment securities and total loans  more than offset a basis point decline in the net yield 
the schedule on pages and provides the detail of changes in interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 
interest income increased percent in and percent in after increasing percent in interest income in grew as a result of a nine percent increase in the volume of average earning assets coupled with a three basis point increase in the average interest rate earned 
a percent increase in the volume of average loans and a basis point decrease in yield accounted for the percent increase in interest income on loans 
interest income on investment securities  including securities available for sale  increased two percent from to this increase resulted from a one percent increase in the average balance of total investment securities and a seven basis point increase in yield 
interest income on trading account securities increased percent as a result of a percent increase in the average balance 
total interest expense increased by nine percent in due to a nine percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities offset partially by a one basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased by one percent as the result of a three percent increase in the average volume and a nine basis point decrease in rate 
the percent increase in average borrowed funds  which includes interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  combined with a basis point increase in rate resulted in a percent increase in interest expense for this category 
a percent increase in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings  which includes million of capital securities  and a percent increase in federal funds purchased were primarily responsible for the increase in averaged borrowed funds in comparison with the prior year 
from to  interest income increased percent as a result of an percent increase in the volume of average earning assets and a basis point decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
interest income on loans rose percent as a result of a percent increase in average volume and a basis point decrease in yield 
interest income on investment securities  including securities available for sale  increased percent from to as a result of a percent increase in average volume and an basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities 
a percent increase in the average balance offset by a basis point decrease in yield increased interest income on trading account securities by percent in a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with an percent increase in average volume resulted in an percent increase in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities in a substantial portion of the increase in total interest expense was due to a percent increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits  resulting from a percent increase in the average volume offset  in part  by a basis point decrease in rate 
a basis point decrease in the rate paid on average borrowed funds  along with a percent increase in average volume  resulted in a percent decrease in interest expense for this category 
net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield increased three basis points to percent in after decreasing three basis points to percent in the moderate increase in net yield in was a function of the downward repricing of interest bearing deposits and fhlb and other borrowings which outpaced the downward repricing of loans and total investment securities 
this is evidenced by the fact the yield on interest earning assets increased three basis points while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by one basis point 
at the same time  the portion of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities in was percent  unchanged from during  the net yield on interest earning assets was minimally impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate floors  increasing the taxable equivalent net yield on interest earning assets by three basis points 
the greatest impact from the use of interest rate contracts was on the yield and interest income on loans where the net yield was increased by five basis points and interest income was increased by million 
at the same time  the impact of interest rate contracts on interest bearing liabilities was less significant  decreasing interest expense by less than million 
the impact of the use of interest rate contracts in was greater than in when the positive impact on the net yield on interest earning assets was one basis point 
it is the company s intention to continue to use interest rate contracts to manage its exposure to the changing interest rate environment in the future  although there can be no assurance that the impact of interest rate contracts on the earnings of future periods will be positive 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread increased four basis points to percent from the spread of percent as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined slightly while the yields earned on earning assets increased by three basis points 
the decrease in was three basis points from percent in see the accompanying tables entitled consolidated average balances  interest income expense and yields rates and rate volume variance analysis for more information 
the following table presents certain interest rates without modification for tax equivalency 
the table on pages and contains these same percentages on a taxable equivalent basis 
tax exempt earning assets continue to make up a smaller percentage of total earning assets 
as a result  the difference between these interest rates with and without modification for tax equivalency continues to narrow

the two basis point increase in the net yield in was a result of an increase in the yields in the company s interest earning assets and a slight decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as discussed earlier

the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the economic outlook for the states in which the company does business is optimistic in the midst of an improvement of the economy overall 
on a regional basis  however  any economic slowdown in the subsidiary banks markets could have an effect on most regional bank holding companies and could impact overall asset growth 
such an economic slowdown would probably also have a negative impact on real estate lending as well as the level of net charge offs and delinquencies 
since an economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on property values and  for commercial development projects  cause an increase in vacancy rates  the possibility exists for write downs  charge offs and the transfer of currently performing loans to a nonaccrual status in the real estate and commercial loan categories 
the mix of loans in the construction and development portfolios are diversified in areas such as office buildings  retail stores and malls  apartment buildings  health care facilities and industrial warehouses 
in addition  the subsidiary banks specialized real estate lending areas review  approve and monitor large real estate credits on a continuing basis 
loan review procedures  including such techniques as loan grading and on site reviews  are constantly utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early in order to lessen any potentially negative impact such problem loans may have on the company s earnings 
automated loan reports are prepared and used in conjunction with the identification and monitoring of such loans on a monthly basis 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in monthly and quarterly reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
special reports are prepared for consumer installment loans to identify trends unique to that portfolio 
a determination of a potential loss will result in a charge to the provision for loan losses  thereby increasing the allowance for loan losses available for potential risk 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an attempt to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be timely identified and an appropriate allowance maintained 
as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in the increase in the level of net charge offs in was concentrated in the consumer installment  commercial real estate mortgages and commercial  financial and agricultural portfolios 
the increase in net charge offs in was attributable to increases in the consumer installment and commercial  financial and agricultural portfolios  while the increase in was the result of increased net charge offs in all loan categories with the exception of residential real estate mortgages 
during  net charge offs of commercial real estate mortgages and commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by  and  respectively  and net charge offs of consumer installment loans increased by million 
the company s consumer installment portfolio was impacted by the continuing nationwide deterioration in consumer credit quality  as indicated by the increasingly high number of bankruptcies 
net charge offs for the credit card portfolio  which represented only three percent of the company s loan portfolio  increased as a percentage of average volume from percent in to percent in net charge offs as a percentage of loans in the company s indirect consumer installment portfolio  consisting primarily of new and used automobile loans  was relatively unchanged from percent in to percent in the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s loans and the allowance for loan losses for the last five years

when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and existing and prospective economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or percent of loans  compared with million  or percent of loans  at december   and million  or percent of loans  at december  as shown in the table below  management determined that at december   approximately percent of the allowance for loan losses was related to commercial  financial and agricultural loans  percent was associated with real estate loans and percent was related to consumer installment loans 
approximately percent of the allowance remained unallocated to any specific category due to uncertainties related to loan portfolios acquired in connection with business combinations with regard to underwriting standards and other factors 
while additional provision is provided with respect to these loans when identified as nonperforming  the corresponding portion of the allowance remains a component of the total allowance upon a loan s return to performing status

it is the general policy of the subsidiary banks to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  an increase of million from year end nonperforming loans increased million from year end to million 
the increase in nonperforming assets in was due  in part  to nonperforming assets acquired in connection with business combinations completed during during  million of loans were transferred to other real estate owned ore offset by total sales of other real estate owned of million 
of these sales  million were cash sales while million represented loans originated by the subsidiary banks to facilitate the sale of other real estate 
during  loans transferred to other real estate owned totaled million  cash sales were million and loans to facilitate the sale of other real estate owned were million 
even though the stabilization in the commercial real estate market in the southeastern part of the country continued during  management will continue to monitor the company s real estate and commercial loan portfolio during particular attention will be focused on those credits identified by the loan monitoring and review process 
management continues to emphasize the need to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets and to return current nonperforming assets to a performing status 
renegotiated loans decreased  from year end while foreclosed real estate declined million for the year 
loans past due days or more increased million compared to the year end level 
other foreclosed or repossessed assets at year end totaled approximately  at december   nonperforming assets were percent of loans outstanding and foreclosed real estate held for sale compared to percent at year end nonaccrual loans and renegotiated loans as a percentage of loans outstanding at year end were percent and percent  respectively

year issues as with other companies  the company has initiated a program to study the impact on its computer systems in order to be year compliant 
this study not only involves identifying any modifications or replacements of certain hardware and software maintained by the company  but also receiving assurance from qualified  independent parties that the appropriate actions have or are being taken by third parties to remedy their year issues for computer systems that the third party is responsible for maintaining and that are relied upon by the company 
in addition  the company is also taking appropriate actions to receive assurance that its customers  principally commercial lending customers  are taking necessary steps to remedy their year issues due to the fact that noncompliance could adversely effect their ability to repay borrowings to the company 
under this program  the company has identified the computer systems which will require either modification  upgrade or replacement 
the company anticipates that in house personnel will be primarily responsible for completing these tasks and although outside contractors may be used  the costs will not be significant 
as such  the company believes that the planned modifications  upgrades and replacement of existing systems  along with third party confirmation  will be completed in a timely fashion to assure year compliance  and any related costs will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition in future periods

 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sfas no 
 which deferred until january   the implementation of certain aspects of the original statement 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or operating results of the company

 reporting comprehensive income  fas and financial accounting statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  fas 
fas establishes reporting and presentation standards for comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances arising from nonowner sources 
fas is effective for both interim and annual financial statements issued for periods beginning after december   and also applies to financial statements presented for prior periods 
fas requires that financial and descriptive information be disclosed for each reportable operating segment based on the management approach 
the management approach focuses on financial information that an enterprise s decision makers use to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocation 
the statement also prescribes the enterprise wide disclosures to be made about products  services  geographic areas and major customers 
fas is effective for annual financial statements issued for periods beginning after december   and for interim financial statements in the second year of application

impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  derivative financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered
