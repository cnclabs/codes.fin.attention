item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results the company s results from operations were a million net loss  or per share  for the fiscal year ended july  versus earnings from operations of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended july  and million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended july  during fiscal  the company recorded the antitrust charge 
excluding the net effects of the antitrust charge  earnings from operations for fiscal were million  or per share 
weighted average common and common share equivalents outstanding were   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
extraordinary losses resulting from the early retirement of the senior notes during the fiscal years presented reduced the company s net results to an million loss  or per share  for fiscal as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s reportable business segments include graphite electrode products  which includes graphite electrodes  needle coke and other graphite specialty products  and calcium carbide products  which includes pipeline acetylene  calcium carbide for metallurgical applications and calcium carbide for fuel gas applications 
the following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods discussed below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands net sales graphite electrode products    calcium carbide products    total net sales    percentage of net sales graphite electrode products calcium carbide products total percentage of net sales gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales graphite electrode products calcium carbide products percentage of total net sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative operating income loss income loss from operations net income loss fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  a increase 
graphite electrode product sales increased to million  while calcium carbide product sales decreased to million 
within the graphite electrode products segment  graphite electrode net sales for fiscal were million  an increase over fiscal as a result of an increase in shipments 
graphite electrode shipments in fiscal totaled million pounds 
domestic and foreign electrode shipments as a percentage of total electrode shipments for fiscal were and  respectively  versus and  respectively  in fiscal the average net price for graphite electrodes for fiscal was per pound  unchanged as compared to fiscal a decrease in the foreign net price of graphite electrodes  which resulted primarily from the continued strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies  was offset by a increase in the domestic net price and the improved domestic foreign sales mix 
needle coke sales for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  with the increase resulting from a increase in shipments and a increase in the average selling price of needle coke 
needle coke shipments were up substantially over fiscal due to increased production capacity at the company s affiliate  seadrift 
the company estimates that as a result of capital expenditures made during fiscal and  the current effective production capacity of seadrift is approximately  tons of premium needle coke 
current weakness in certain regions of the global economy is expected to have a negative impact on demand for graphite electrodes and premium needle coke and has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in lower shipments and or average prices of graphite electrodes and needle coke in fiscal and  potentially  beyond 
graphite specialty product sales during fiscal totaled million versus million in fiscal the decrease in sales was principally the result of the expiration of the sgl supply agreement 
the contract expired in january within the calcium carbide products segment  pipeline acetylene sales were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal resulting from a increase in pipeline acetylene deliveries 
sales of calcium carbide for metallurgical applications were million  a decrease from last year resulting from a decline in shipments and a decrease in prices 
sales of calcium carbide for fuel gas applications totaled million  a decrease resulting from a decrease in shipments and a decrease in prices 
net sales of calcium carbide for metallurgical and fuel gas applications are expected to continue to decline in fiscal as a result of increasing competition in these product lines 
all other calcium carbide products net sales totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of resulting primarily from lower shipments of electrically calcined anthracite coal 
gross profit as a percentage of graphite electrode product sales for fiscal was versus in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin resulted primarily from the disruption in production of needle coke which resulted from the extended plant shutdown to install and start up new equipment at the company s affiliate  seadrift 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased during fiscal to million as a result of the company s capital expenditures during fiscal years and the negative impact from the extended shutdown and higher depreciation charge more than offset the benefits of increased needle coke and graphite electrode sales volumes and improved needle coke prices during fiscal in addition  the cost of decant oil  the primary raw material in the production of needle coke  during the fiscal year ended july  was approximately lower as compared to a year ago  which contributed positively to the gross margin 
gross profit as a percentage of calcium carbide product sales for fiscal was versus in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of lower operating costs during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in incentive compensation expenses for salaried employees in fiscal during the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a million non recurring charge to provide for benefits associated with the early retirement of two executives of the company 
during fiscal  the company recorded the antitrust charge  a million pre tax charge million after expected tax benefits  classified as other expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended july   for potential liabilities resulting from civil lawsuits  claims  legal costs and other expenses associated with pending antitrust matters 
based on the information currently available to the company to date including the nature of the antitrust claims against the company and its defenses  the company presently believes the antitrust charge should be appropriate under the present assumptions to address the resolution of the civil suits and other claims and costs associated with the antitrust investigations 
the company understands that defendants ucar and showa denko recently reached settlements at substantially higher amounts with the class action plaintiffs and certain individual purchasers 
in light of these and other future developments and other factors  the actual liabilities  costs and expenses resulting from the antitrust matters including the european commission antitrust investigation could differ materially from the current estimate which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and its ability to service its currently planned liquidity needs 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
net interest expense for fiscal was million  including million of interest expense associated with the revolving credit facility  million in interest expense associated with the senior notes and million in amortization and bank fees

net interest expense for fiscal was million  including million in interest expense associated with the senior notes and million in amortization 
these interest expense items were reduced by million in capitalized interest and million in interest income in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of versus a provision of for fiscal the benefit for fiscal was unusually low relative to the federal statutory rate of due to state income tax expenses  the write off of certain state net operating loss tax benefits  the effect of non deductible expenses incurred throughout fiscal and the impact of adjustments to the company s prior year tax estimates 
as a result of the tender and revolving credit facility refinancing  the company recorded a million net extraordinary loss on the early retirement of debt during fiscal this extraordinary charge represents the premium paid to senior note holders in connection with the tender and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the senior notes tendered and the revolving credit facility 
fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal  an increase 
graphite electrode product sales increased over the prior year to million  while calcium carbide product sales were unchanged at million 
within the graphite electrode products segment  graphite electrode net sales for fiscal were million  a increase over fiscal as a result of a increase in shipments and a increase in the average net sales price of graphite electrodes 
graphite electrode shipments in fiscal totaled million pounds 
domestic and foreign electrode shipments as a percentage of total electrode shipments for fiscal were and  respectively  versus and in fiscal a domestic price increase during fiscal resulted in the increase in the average net sales price of graphite electrodes 
the majority of foreign electrode sales are denominated in local currencies  most of which were weaker in relation to the us dollar 
as a result  net price realizations on foreign sales were lower for fiscal versus fiscal  partially offsetting the benefits of the domestic price increase 
needle coke sales for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal needle coke sales were up substantially over fiscal due to increased production capacity at seadrift 
in addition  the average net price for needle coke was higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal graphite specialty product sales during fiscal totaled million versus million for fiscal included in graphite specialty product sales for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  of sales of large graphite rods and plates and other processing sales under the sgl supply agreement 
the sgl supply agreement was entered into in connection with the specialty products sale 
the increase in graphite specialty product sales during fiscal was the result of increased sales under the sgl supply agreement  as well as increased shipments of bulk and granular graphite 
within the calcium carbide products segment  pipeline acetylene sales were million  a decrease from fiscal resulting from a decrease in shipments and an decrease in prices 
offsetting this decline was a increase in sales of calcium carbide for fuel gas applications which totaled million 
also  carbide lime sales were up to million 
the increases noted were primarily the result of increased shipments 
sales of calcium carbide for metallurgical applications were essentially unchanged at million for fiscal all other calcium carbide product sales were also unchanged at million 
gross profit as a percentage of graphite electrode product sales for fiscal was versus in fiscal the increase in the gross margin resulted from increased shipments and net selling prices for both needle coke and graphite electrodes  as well as increased needle coke production during fiscal partially offsetting these benefits were the negative effects of increased feedstock costs at seadrift  which were higher during fiscal gross profit as a percentage of calcium carbide product sales for fiscal was versus for fiscal during fiscal  the company received a million favorable settlement from a utility rate dispute with one of its electric power suppliers 
the million payment received was reflected as a reduction in cost of goods sold for fiscal excluding this settlement  gross profit as a percentage of calcium carbide product sales for fiscal was 
the decrease in the calcium carbide gross margin was due primarily to lower sales of pipeline acetylene and higher raw material and labor costs during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the settlement of a lawsuit in the fiscal first quarter  costs associated with the search for a new chief executive officer for the company and an increase in employee related costs in fiscal early retirement severance charges for fiscal represent costs associated with the retirement of two executives of the company during fiscal in october  the company formally entered into the china contract 
the china contract is a long term contract with an engineering design and consulting firm to provide process design expertise and training services related to the construction of a graphite electrode plant in the people s republic of china 
revenue related to the contract was recognized as services were performed for the process design expertise portion of the contract  and using a percentage of contract completed approach for the training services stage of the contract 
other income in fiscal represents revenues earned under the process design expertise portion of the contract  less applicable expenses 
total revenues under the contract were expected to be approximately million  million of which has been recognized as of july  at this time  the project has been delayed by the chinese government  and management cannot determine whether the balance of the revenue expected under the contract will be realized 
net interest expense for fiscal was million  including million of interest expense and million in amortization expense associated with the senior notes  less million of interest income and million in capitalized interest associated with the modernization program 
the average outstanding balance of senior notes during fiscal was million

special financing expenses in fiscal represent charges for accounting  legal  printing and other fees related to the company s public stock offerings in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the company s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  less the benefits of its foreign sales corporation 
fiscal s effective rate was unusually low due to adjustments to prior year estimates of the benefit from the company s foreign sales corporation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  earnings per share  sfas  disclosures of information about capital structure and sfas  reporting comprehensive income for its fiscal year ended july  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new financial accounting and reporting standards that the company will be required to adopt in the coming fiscal years 
the company is required to adopt sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas and sfas  employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment to fasb statements  and sfas for its fiscal year ending july  sfas will require the company to expand its disclosure of information on its reportable segments 
sfas standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company is required to adopt sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas for its fiscal year ending july  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging activities 
the company has not yet evaluated the financial accounting and reporting impact of sfas liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures  working capital and debt service on its revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures over fiscal and fiscal should average between million and million per annum  assuming the commencement of the million longitudinal graphitizing project in fiscal the company believes that its cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund all of its currently planned liquidity needs through at least the expiration of the revolving credit facility in september however  in the event these resources are not sufficient to fund the company s planned capital expenditures  service its indebtedness and pay any other obligation including those that may arise from pending legal proceedings and the resolution of current antitrust matters  the company may be required to obtain additional funding or delay certain discretionary capital projects 
if the company were required to obtain additional funding to satisfy its liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that sources of funds would be available in amounts sufficient for the company to meet its obligations or on terms favorable to the company 
on september   the company completed the tender 
the tender price paid to holders of the senior notes was  for each  in senior note principal 
also  most holders received an additional per  in senior note principal in exchange for their consent to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain default provisions in the senior note indenture other than the covenants to pay interest on and principal of the senior notes and the default provisions related to such covenants 
consents were received by holders of more than a majority of the outstanding senior notes  resulting in the elimination of such restrictive covenants and default provisions 
after the tender  million in senior notes were outstanding 
subsequent to july   the company notified the trustee of the senior notes that it intended to exercise an option to redeem early the remaining senior notes at a price of  for each  in senior note principal  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the early redemption of the remaining senior notes outstanding was completed during the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ending july  and will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the tender  the company entered into the revolving credit facility  as amended 
the revolving credit facility replaced the revolving credit facility 
interest under the revolving credit facility is based on  at the option of the company  either pnc bank s prime rate or a floating libor rate plus a spread currently based on a leverage calculation specifically  the consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratio 
as of july   the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 
repayment of funds borrowed under the new credit agreement is not required until the expiration of the facility on september  the most restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility include a minimum interest coverage ratio of to  a maximum consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratio of to and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth ratio  all as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement 
during the fiscal year ended july   the revolving credit facility was amended to incorporate the antitrust charge 
the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility agreement were generally amended to exclude the effects of the antitrust charge  although the cash flow impact associated with any future settlements of pending antitrust claims will effectively reduce ebitda in the computation of the consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratio computed for pricing purposes in the future 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized with receivables and inventory 
as of july   the company had approximately million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
as of july   borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million and letters of credit outstanding totaled approximately million 
on march   the company s board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase the company s common stock 
subject to price and market considerations and applicable securities laws  such purchases may be made from time to time in open market  privately negotiated or other transactions 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other corporate considerations 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million under its stock repurchase program 
as of september   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for million under its stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  total assets increased million to million 
the increase resulted primarily from capital expenditures of million  less million of depreciation and amortization 
total liabilities increased million during fiscal to million 
the increase resulted primarily from the antitrust charge as well as a million increase in long term debt 
stockholders equity decreased million during fiscal to million 
the decrease resulted primarily from the company s net loss of million during fiscal net cash provided by operations for fiscal was million versus million for fiscal operating cash inflows for fiscal included million in net income before adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by operations and the net effect of the antitrust charge 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a million net cash outflow from changes in other working capital items  including a million increase in inventories 
interest and income taxes paid during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the company s investing activities have historically included short term investments and capital expenditures ranging from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the substantial increase in capital expenditures since fiscal is due primarily to the modernization program and other significant capital projects initiated in fiscal the company believes that most of its future investing activity cash flow requirements will be for capital expenditures 
the company s financing activities have principally represented short term draw downs and repayments on its revolving credit facilities  as well as periodic repurchases of senior notes in open market transactions and cash inflows from exercises of stock options 
other financing activities during fiscal also included the effects of the tender and the repurchase of treasury shares of common stock for million 
other financing activities during fiscal also included the effects of the sale of  shares of common stock to the public in a secondary underwritten offering the initial offering and a redemption of million in senior notes 
quantitative and qualitative information about market risk the company is exposed to financial  market and economic risks in many areas of its business 
the company utilizes several financial instruments and risk management programs in an effort to mitigate much of this exposure 
the following is a summarization of the programs utilized by the company in an attempt to mitigate these risks 
foreign currency risks approximately of the company s net sales during each of the fiscal years ended july   and were to customers located in foreign countries 
the majority of these foreign sales were denominated in local currencies  subjecting the company to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company regularly enters into forward foreign currency contracts to help mitigate foreign currency exchange rate exposure on customer accounts receivable and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts require the company to deliver foreign currencies in the future in order to receive us dollars owed to it under the contracts at settlement 
in the past  the company has been generally successful in fulfilling its obligations to deliver the foreign currencies due under its forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts generally mature within months and are principally unsecured contracts with commercial banks 
gains and losses related to forward foreign currency contracts are deferred and recognized in income at the time of the sale of the product 
as of july  and  the company had million and million  respectively  in forward foreign currency contracts outstanding 
a hypothetical change in forward rates would result in a pretax gain or loss of approximately million related to the contracts outstanding as of july   although any gain or loss would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of future collections on foreign accounts receivable or sales commitments 
for purposes of this sensitivity analysis  october forward rates as of july  were adjusted by the hypothetical change and applied to the notional value of the contracts outstanding 
the average maturity of the company s forward foreign currency contracts is october the cash flows from these contracts are classified in a manner consistent with the underlying nature of the transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s foreign currency exposure  including customer accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency contracts outstanding 
commodity price risks the company s affiliate  seadrift  purchases approximately million barrels of low sulfur decant oil each year to produce needle coke  the key raw material in the production of graphite electrodes 
the cost of refinery decant oil is pegged to the us gulf coast spot cargo barge prices and  in some cases  west texas intermediate crude oil 
the company regularly enters into crude oil and low sulfur fuel oil futures and swap agreements in order to help mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the cost of decant oil 
these futures and swap contracts are financial hedges  the company never actually takes delivery of the oil product that is the subject of the contracts 
in the case of futures contracts  the company agrees to purchase crude oil in the future at a set price  then liquidates the contract prior to settlement 
the difference between the price of crude oil on the date the company enters into the contract and the price on the settlement date represents the financial gain or loss on that contract 
in the case of swap contracts  the company agrees to pay a fixed price for low sulfur fuel oil and a counter party agrees to pay the variable market price for a particular month 
the difference between the fixed price and the average market price for the applicable month represents the financial gain or loss on the contract 
gains and losses associated with these contracts  when settled  are deferred as an adjustment to seadrift s oil inventory values and  ultimately  the carrying cost of needle coke 
as of july   the company had million and million in crude oil futures and low sulfur fuel oil swap contracts  respectively  and million and million  respectively  as of july  a change in the futures rates for crude oil and low sulfur fuel oil would result in a million gain or loss related to these contracts  although any gain or loss would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the purchase price of low sulfur decant oil expected to be purchased in the future 
this hypothetical computation assumes a parallel shift in the applicable commodity futures prices 
for purposes of this sensitivity analysis  forward crude oil and low sulfur fuel oil prices for the months of august through december were adjusted by the hypothetical change and applied to the notional number of barrels being hedged per the contracts outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the consolidated financial statement impact of the company s oil hedging activities during the fiscal years presented therein 
interest rate risks the company s indebtedness as of july  is comprised primarily of million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
interest cost under the revolving credit facility is based on either pnc bank s prime rate or a floating libor rate plus a spread currently based on a leverage calculation 
the company uses interest rate swap and cap agreements to hedge a portion of its debt cost in an attempt to strike a favorable balance between fixed and variable rate debt and keep financing costs as low as possible 
in conjunction with the revolving credit facility refinancing completed in september  the company entered into several interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the company s interest rate at approximately for a decreasing level of borrowings outstanding ranging from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the interest rate swap agreements did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements during the fiscal year ended july  the interest rate cap agreements effectively cap the company s base libor rate at on borrowings ranging from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the interest rate cap agreements did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended july  the company s effective interest rate  which includes actual interest costs as well as bank fees and amortization of debt transaction costs  for its fiscal year ended july  was 
this effective interest rate includes million in interest costs associated with the senior notes  as the tender was not completed until the end of september the company s blended effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of july  was 
a hypothetical change in the blended effective interest rate assuming debt levels as of july  would result in a million increase or decrease in interest costs 
legal and environmental matters in may  the company was served with a subpoena issued by a grand jury empanelled by the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the company was advised by attorneys for the doj that the grand jury is investigating price fixing by producers of graphite products in the united states and abroad during the past five years 
the company is cooperating with the doj in the investigation 
the doj has granted the company and certain former and present senior executives the opportunity to participate in its corporate leniency program and the company has entered into an agreement with the doj under which the company and such executives who cooperate will not be subject to criminal prosecution with respect to the investigation if charges are issued by the grand jury 
under the agreement  the company has agreed to use its best efforts to provide for restitution to its domestic customers for actual damages if any conduct of the company which violated the federal antitrust laws in the manufacture and sale of such graphite products caused damage to such customers 
subsequent to the initiation of the doj investigation  four civil cases were filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in philadelphia asserting claims on behalf of a class of purchasers for violations of the sherman act 
these cases  which have been consolidated  name the company  ucar  sgl corp 
and sgl as defendants and seek treble damages 
on march   a number of purchasers who were previously included in the purported class of plaintiffs covered by the consolidated case initiated a separate action in the same district court which asserts substantially the same claims and seeks the same relief as the consolidated case and names the named defendants as well as showa denko 
thereafter  five additional purchasers who were previously included in the purported class of plaintiffs covered by the consolidated case instituted their own actions against the named defendants  showa denko and  in several cases  certain present or former related parties of ucar asserting substantially the same claims and seeking the same relief as in the consolidated cases 
three such actions were filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on april   april  and may   respectively 
one action was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio on april  but has been transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania for pre trial proceedings 
one such action was filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on june   the company is seeking to have this case transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania for pre trial proceedings 
the company understands that defendants ucar and showa denko have reached settlement agreements with the class action plaintiffs  which are subject by law to court approval  and have also settled claims brought by some of the individual purchasers 
the company further understands that ucar and showa denko have pleaded guilty to antitrust conspiracy charges filed by the doj and have been ordered to pay fines in connection with those guilty pleas 
the company has also advised the commission of the european communities that it wishes to invoke the commission s leniency notice 
generally under these guidelines  the european commission may substantially reduce fines and other penalties if a company cooperates with the european commission and in the judgment of the european commission provides significant information 
the company understands that the european commission will determine any fines at the completion of its proceedings that may not be concluded for a year or more 
on june   a group of canadian purchasers filed a lawsuit in the ontario court general division claiming a conspiracy and violations of the canadian competition act 
the canadian lawsuit names the named defendants as well as several present or former parents  subsidiaries and or affiliates of ucar  sgl and showa denko 
the canadian competition and consumer law division has initiated an inquiry and the company is cooperating fully with the authorities conducting that inquiry 
during fiscal  the company recorded the antitrust charge 
based on the information currently available to the company to date including the nature of the antitrust claims against the company and its defenses  the company presently believes the antitrust charge should be appropriate under the present assumptions to address the resolution of the civil suits and other claims and costs associated with the antitrust investigations 
the company understands that defendants ucar and showa denko recently reached settlements at substantially higher amounts with the class action plaintiffs and certain individual purchasers 
in light of these and other future developments and other factors  the actual liabilities  costs and expenses resulting from the antitrust matters including the european commission antitrust investigation could differ materially from the current estimate which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and its ability to service its currently planned liquidity needs 
during fiscal  the company was named as a third party defendant in the sayreville litigation 
recently  three of the seven third party plaintiffs have agreed with the company to dismiss their third party claims 
a stipulation of dismissal is being circulated and will shortly be submitted to the court for approval 
the remaining four third party plaintiffs have recently entered into settlement agreements directly with the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs report that those settlement agreements include a provision requiring the settlors to dismiss all claims made in the lawsuit  which includes the third party claims made against the company 
the plaintiffs expect the stipulations of dismissal relating to the settlements to be submitted for court approval shortly 
upon approval of the foregoing stipulations by the court  all claims against the company will be dismissed 
carbon graphite group  inc was named as successor to airco speer 
since this landfill was closed prior to the organization of the company in  the company s only possible connection with the sayreville litigation would be if it were a successor to airco speer  a claim which it disputes 
furthermore  in the purchase agreement by which the company acquired its operating assets the asset purchase agreement from boc  boc agreed to provide an indemnification for certain environmental matters 
boc has assumed and commenced the defense of the sayreville litigation and has agreed to indemnify the company for certain losses associated therewith in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
boc in turn is being indemnified by certain plaintiffs in the litigation pursuant to a agreement 
in addition  boc asserts that the liability in this matter was settled by the agreement with the plaintiffs in the present case 
as a result of a motion for summary judgment  the court has substantially reduced the scope of claims which may be asserted against the company 
based on the above  management does not believe that the company will incur a material loss with respect to the sayreville litigation 
the company is also party to various legal proceedings considered incidental to the conduct of its business or otherwise not material in the judgment of management 
management does not believe that its loss exposure related to these cases is materially greater than amounts provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of july  as of july   a million reserve has been recorded to provide for estimated exposure on claims for which a loss is deemed probable 
year the company is in the process of modifying  upgrading and replacing certain components of its computer software and operating systems to accommodate the year changes required for correct recording of dates in the year and beyond 
the company believes that its current plan will adequately address the year issue and the company does not expect to experience significant operational problems associated with year compliance once its program is complete 
the costs of system conversions and software upgrades  which are expected to be completed by mid  are not expected to be material 
the company is also evaluating the year compliance programs of its critical customers  suppliers and service providers in an attempt to determine the adequacy of their programs in addressing the year issue
