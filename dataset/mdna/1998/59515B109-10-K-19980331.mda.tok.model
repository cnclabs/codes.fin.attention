pending increased utilization of the company s existing manufacturing capacity at its arden and abbeville manufacturing plants and adjusting pricing of orex degradables to take into account disposal cost savings over traditional products  the overhead of the company incurred through its arden and abbeville plants will continue to negatively impact profit margins 
the company s ability to achieve such objectives is subject to a number of risks described under business risk factors including without limitation risks of new products and manufacturing and supply risks

for  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  and net cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
the million provision of cash from operating activities in results principally from a million decrease in gross inventory  a million decrease in gross accounts receivable and a million increase in accounts payable offset by losses experienced during the year 
during accounts receivable declined from approximately million to million  inventory including prepaid inventory declined from approximately million to million reflecting the impact of the company s adoption of synchronous manufacturing methodology  and accounts payable increased from approximately million to million

because of manufacturing inefficiencies  and related unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  coupled with unit pricing for sales of orex degradables at an amount which does not take into account the disposal cost savings provided by these products  the company failed to achieve profitable margins on the sales of orex degradables 
based upon a combination of factors  including determinations by the company that the carrying value of its orex manufacturing facilities are not justified by current orex sales volumes  the company s belief that it could satisfy any future requirements for manufacturing woven and non woven orex products from third party contract manufacturers  and the company s objective to reduce its debt and make available funds to further develop the orex technology  the company has decided to sell its orex manufacturing facilities as well as its white knight subsidiary 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully sell all or any of the foregoing assets at satisfactory prices 
if successful  the company believes these planned divestitures will provide funds to reduce debt  relieve the company of burdens associated with these underperforming assets  provide focus upon the remaining business units operated by the company and provide funds for the further development of orex technology
