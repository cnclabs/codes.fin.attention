additionally  the increase in net premiums written in includes approximately  of growth generated by a national account program started by ebi in the first quarter of the increases in net premiums written are mitigated in part by the effects of legislative reforms in certain states that have led to an increasingly competitive workers compensation marketplace with lower premium rates as well as a reduction in losses

this decline is due to the sale of the assumed reinsurance business 
guaranty national net premiums written for guaranty national are as follows percent change s omitted personal lines   commercial lines   collateral protection   the net premiums written growth for personal lines in is due to newly enacted legislation in the state of california which requires all drivers to maintain liability insurance 
this change in california law resulted in a increase in the personal lines one month product business to approximately  in commercial lines net premiums written decreased by in due to lower production in nonstandard business  increased competition by standard carriers in the nonstandard marketplace  and the effect of both agent and program cancellations 
the premium volume growth for collateral protection in comes from increased writing in mortgage fire insurance and mechanical breakdown programs

the increase in collateral protection for is primarily from two new products  automobile financing gap and mortgage fire insurance 
the company s premiums earned increased  to  in and increased  to  in from  in premiums earned reflect the recognition of income from the changing levels of net premium writings  as well as the inclusion of guaranty national s premiums earned of  in investment performance the performance of the company s investments  including net investment income  net realized gains losses and unrealized appreciation depreciation is as follows s omitted net investment income    net realized gains losses fixed maturities    equity securities    net unrealized appreciation depreciation fixed maturities    equity securities    net investment income pre tax net investment income is   and  in  and  respectively 
the pre tax yields on the average investment portfolio are in  in and in  with after tax yields of  and  respectively 
net investment income increased in primarily due to a higher investment base and a slight increase in pre tax investment yields 
the higher investment base for reflects the proceeds from the issuance of  of trust preferred securities in january and the effects of positive operating cash flow 
these increases have been offset in part by the july cash outlay of approximately  for the purchase of guaranty national common shares 
net investment income increased in from the inclusion of guaranty national s net investment income of  as well as by increased earnings on a higher investment base from positive operating cash flow 
this increase occurred notwithstanding a growing portfolio of lower yielding tax advantaged securities and the cash outlay to acquire guaranty national common stock 
the year to year changes in net investment income also reflect increases from limited partnership investment equity earnings of  or  from to and  or  from to limited partnership earnings increased in due to higher earnings from the largest limited partnership investment and the inclusion of guaranty national s partnership earnings 
the increase in limited partnership earnings for is primarily attributable to favorable performance for a majority of the limited partnership investments partly offset by lower earnings as compared to from the largest investment 
earnings from limited partnership investments can vary considerably from year to year 
the company s long term experience with limited partnership investments has been quite favorable  however  they represent only and of total investments at december  and  respectively 
net investment income has also increased in both years by income generated from the deployment of operating cash flow 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio amounted to  at december  and  at december  fixed maturity investments which the company has both the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
fixed maturity investments which may be sold in response to  among other things  changes in interest rates  prepayment risk  income tax strategies or liquidity needs are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value 
the carrying value of fixed maturity and short term investments is  and  at december  and  respectively  or approximately and of the company s cash and investments 
the company s investment philosophy is to achieve a superior rate of return after taxes  while maintaining a proper balance of safety  liquidity  maturity and marketability 
the company invests primarily in investment grade securities and strives to enhance the average return of its portfolio through limited investment in a diversified group of non investment grade fixed maturity securities or securities that are not rated 
the risk of loss due to default is generally considered greater for non investment grade securities than for investment grade securities because the former  among other things  are often subordinated to other indebtedness of the issuer and are often issued by highly leveraged companies 
at december  and  the company s investment in non investment grade and non rated fixed maturity securities were carried at  and  respectively 
these investments represented a total of and of cash and investments and and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the company monitors the financial condition of the issuers of securities that it owns 
when conditions are deemed appropriate  the company ceases to accrete discounts  or accrue interest and dividends and  in cases where the value of such investments is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  recognizes losses 
the company s non investment grade securities are highly diversified  with an average investment per issuer of approximately  at december  the largest non investment grade security had a carrying value of  at december  realized investment gains net realized investment gains are  in   in and  in sales of equity securities have resulted in net gains of   and  and sales of fixed maturity investments have resulted in net gains losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
realized investment gains are reduced by provisions for losses on securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
these provisions amounted to  in   in and  in for equity securities and   and  in  and  respectively  for fixed maturity investments 
such provisions  based on available information at the time  are made in consideration of the decline in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities 
realized gains losses vary from period to period  depending on market conditions relative to the company s investment holdings  the timing of investment sales generating gains and losses  the occurrence of events which give rise to other than temporary impairment of investments  and other factors 
at december  the company held equity securities with unrealized appreciation of  and the market value of the fixed maturities portfolio exceeds amortized cost by  such amounts can vary significantly depending upon fluctuations in the financial markets 
equity securities and fixed maturities had unrealized appreciation of  and  respectively  for  even after taking  of realized net gains excluding impairment adjustments 
the increase in market values of fixed maturities during is primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates during the year 
the average maturity of the company s fixed maturities has increased from years at december  to years at december  expenses and other operating ratios the following table sets forth certain ratios of insurance operating expenses to premiums earned year ended december  loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition and other insurance expenses total before policyholders dividends policyholders dividends combined ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses regional operations special programs guaranty national the decrease in the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expense to premiums earned the loss ratio is attributed to improvements in both the regional operations and guaranty national segments  offset in part by higher losses for special programs 
the decrease in the loss ratio is attributable to improvements in both the regional operations and special programs segments  offset in part by the consolidation of guaranty national in the company s efforts to reduce its loss costs have had a positive impact on profitability 
the continued improvement in the loss ratio for regional operations results from the favorable loss development and loss experience achieved by ebi through its service oriented approach 
ebi s service oriented approach is to work with its customers to prevent losses and reduce claim costs 
the increase in the loss ratio for special programs is mainly attributable to losses from certain programs cancelled by connecticut specialty 
the loss ratio increase has been partly offset by the favorable effect of a change in this segment s mix of business  particularly the lower premiums and losses from the assumed reinsurance business that the company exited in november the improvement in the loss ratio for this segment is primarily attributable to a lower loss ratio for connecticut specialty  both from the change in its reinsurance during and the impact on results of certain cancelled programs which had unfavorable loss experience in these improvements are offset in part by reserve strengthening for the company s pools and associations and reinsurance business in and as discussed above  the company formed orion specialty through the merger of connecticut specialty and the commercial lines of guaranty national 
on a pro forma basis  special programs loss ratio for would be with restatement to include orion specialty 
guaranty national s loss ratio has declined due to an improvement in its personal lines loss ratio to for from for and from the more favorable effect of a change in this segments mix of business to personal lines 
this improvement has been partly offset by an increase in the commercial line loss ratio from for to for the improvement in the personal lines loss ratio for is primarily attributable to lower claims frequency 
this improvement has been offset in part by costs incurred to improve claim handling and reduce insurance fraud in personal lines and by higher estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the commercial automobile line of business 
the lower loss ratio for as compared to was primarily attributable to guaranty national having significantly strengthened its loss reserves for both personal and commercial lines in in response to adverse claim trends during the adverse claims trends resulted in higher than expected development due to higher claims severity in through for commercial automobile and higher claims frequency for personal automobile lines of business 
also during  personal lines experienced lower claims severity and commercial lines had lower overall claims severity and frequency 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses to premiums earned the expense ratio is  and in  and  respectively 
policy acquisition costs include direct costs  such as commissions  premium taxes  and salaries  that relate to and vary with the production of new and renewal business 
these costs are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned  subject to a periodic test for recoverability 
the increases in the expense ratio are attributable to the company s continued investment in building its loss prevention competencies and the costs of expanding in new territories and changing the ebi office operations 
additionally  the increases are the result of higher commissions for ebi and connecticut specialty  including a change in reinsurance in which provides for lower ceding commissions 
the increase for also reflects the consolidation of guaranty national 
the ratio of policyholders dividends to premiums earned the dividend ratio is  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the dividend ratio for results from the consolidation of premiums from guaranty national  which does not have participating policies 
the company s consolidated combined ratio is in  in and in provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses include development of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relating to prior accident years  which increased the calendar year combined ratio by percentage points in both and and percentage points in the loss ratios are adversely affected by loss development in the pools and associations  reinsurance  certain discontinued lines and program business  reduced by favorable development in the workers compensation insurance line of business from the improved application of loss prevention and loss control procedures 
the company s environmental claims principally relate to asbestos and hazardous waste  arising from certain liability business written prior to the mid s  which business was never a major element of the company s operations 
environmental claims are also received from certain reinsurance pools and associations where reserves are established based on information reported to the company by the managers of those pools and associations 
the company discontinued its participation in these reinsurance pools and associations in the mid s 
establishing reserve liabilities for environmental claims is subject to significant uncertainties that make reserve estimation difficult 
legal decisions have tended to expand insurance coverage beyond the intent of the policies 
the disposition of such claims often requires lengthy and costly litigation 
uncertainties as to required clean up remedies and difficulties in identifying the responsible parties add further to the complexity of reserve estimation for these claims 
in recent years  the company has intensified its efforts to settle and close environmental claims 
in recognition of these efforts  reserves have also been increased to provide for the costs related to settling claims 
to help minimize the cost of losses and claims  the company maintains a dedicated environmental claims staff which administers and continually evaluates each claim and its defense and settlement possibilities 
in  and excludes guaranty national  the company paid   and  respectively  for the costs of defending and settling such claims 
payments in  and related to  and claims  respectively  for the company s direct business 
claim counts have been aggregated by year of coverage for each occurrence for which policyholders are being defended  and often include numerous claimants 
as of december  and  the company has environmental claims related loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  of  and  respectively 
claims counts are and at december  and  respectively  for direct business written by the company which excludes reinsurance pools and associations 
following industry practice  claim counts are generally established for each insured for each policy 
for workers compensation claims  individual claimants are counted in claim counts 
changes in claims counts for and are primarily attibutable to ebi  which is not a significant component of the company s environmental reserves 
in estimating liabilities for environmental related claims  the company considers all pertinent information as it becomes available 
the net reserve for environmental claims and ibnr increased  in and  in primarily due to higher claims reported to the company by certain reinsurance pools and associations  which is the basis of establishing such reserve  and higher loss reserve estimates 
the reserve increase also reflects the inclusion of guaranty national 
management believes that the company s reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses make reasonable and sufficient provision for the ultimate cost of all losses on claims incurred 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in loss trends will not result in additional development of prior years reserves in the future 
variability in claim emergence and settlement patterns and other trends in loss experience can result in future development patterns different than expected 
the company believes that any such development will continue at the low levels experienced in recent years  considering actions that have been taken to increase reserving levels  improve underwriting standards and emphasize loss prevention and control 
the company s loss ratios in recent years  including development of prior years losses  have compared favorably with loss ratios experienced by the industry 
the company limits both current losses and future development of losses by ceding business to reinsurers 
the company continually monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers and  to the company s knowledge  has no material exposure with regard to potential unrecognized losses due to reinsurers having known financial difficulties 
interest expense interest expense is  in   in and  in  increasing in and in interest expense increased in due to the inclusion of interest on guaranty national s  bank debt  and higher average debt outstanding after the issuance of  of senior notes by orion on july   offset in part by the repayment of orion s bank debt at that time 
other expenses other expenses are   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases in both other income and other expenses for are primarily attributable to the inclusion of mcgee s pool management revenue and expenses after it was acquired by the company on june equity in earnings of affiliates equity in earnings of affiliates consists of earnings of  for  a loss of  for  and includes earnings of  for from the company s investment in intercargo 
the company records its share of intercargo s results in the subsequent quarter 
the earnings reflect a pre tax gain of  from intercargo s sale of kingsway financial services 
in  guaranty national was a non majority owned affiliate of the company and was therefore accounted for using the equity method 
included in equity in net earnings of affiliates from guaranty national was  in earnings before federal income taxes and minority interest expense earnings before federal income taxes and minority interest expense are   and  for  and  respectively 
the increases in pre tax earnings of and for and reflect the increase in ownership of guaranty national and improvement in insurance operations profitability of  and  and increases in realized investment gains of  and  respectively 
minority interest expense guaranty national became a majority owned subsidiary in july  and its results have been consolidated in the company s financial statements since the beginning of in december  guaranty national became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
minority interest expense of  and  is recorded for the after tax portion of guaranty national s and  respectively  earnings attributable to stockholders of guaranty national other than the company 
minority interest expense in subsidiary trust preferred securities of  for represents the financing cost  after the federal income tax deduction  on orion s  of trust preferred securities issued in january federal income taxes federal income taxes on pre tax operating results and the related effective tax rates are for  for and for the company s effective tax rates for  and are less than the statutory tax rate of primarily because of income derived from tax advantaged securities 
in october the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of the company s federal income tax returns through as described in previously issued financial statements of the company  certain tax benefits from tax attributes existing at the date of the company s reorganization in were not recognized pending completion of the irs examination 
accordingly  the company recorded a credit to capital surplus in for tax benefits of  with respect to the reorganization 
the recording of this credit had no impact on the company s earnings 
the company has included guaranty national in its consolidated tax return since  as a result of acquiring over ownership 
the liability for deferred taxes established by the company through june  for its share of guaranty national s undistributed earnings has been reversed  resulting in a reduction of  in the amount of goodwill recorded from the purchase of guaranty national shares  with no effect on net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased by  to  in from  in and increased  in from  in the decrease in operating cash flow for is the result of higher payments for losses  policy acquisition costs  policyholders dividends and minority interest from subsidiary trust preferred capital securities  consistent with the company s growth in recent years and including the payment of losses for the assumed reinsurance business the company exited in november and certain cancelled program business 
partially offsetting these increased cash outflows are higher premiums collected  reflective of the company s current rate of growth  as well as higher investment income collected 
the increase for is attributable to including guaranty national s cash flow in the company s consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investment activities increased by  to  in from  in and decreased  in from  in cash is used in investment activities primarily for purchases of investments and acquisition activities 
investment purchases are funded by maturities and sales of investments  as well as by the net cash from positive operating cash flows after cash provided by or used in financing activities 
cash used in acquisition activities in includes  for the purchase of guaranty national common stock   for the purchase of unisun net of cash acquired  and a  purchase price deposit for the planned acquisition of strickland 
the total purchase price for strickland is  in july the company purchased guaranty national common stock for cash of  in june orion paid  in cash plus acquisition costs to acquire mcgee

cash used in financing activities includes dividend payments  debt repayments and payments related to the company s common stock repurchase program 
orion has increased the quarterly dividend rate on its common stock by in the third quarter of  by an additional and in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  and by in the second quarter of orion s uses of cash consist of debt service  dividends to stockholders and overhead expenses 
these cash uses are funded from existing available cash  financing transactions and receipt of dividends  reimbursement of overhead expenses and amounts in lieu of federal income taxes from orion s insurance subsidiaries 
orion has received   and  in dividends    and  for overhead expenses and federal tax payments of   and  from its insurance subsidiaries in  and  respectively 
payments of dividends by orion s insurance subsidiaries must comply with insurance regulatory limitations concerning stockholder dividends and capital adequacy 
state insurance regulators have broad discretionary authority with respect to limitations on the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
limitations under current regulations are well in excess of orion s cash requirements 
orion s insurance subsidiaries maintain liquidity in their investment portfolios substantially in excess of that required to pay claims and expenses 
the insurance subsidiaries held cash and short term investments of  and  at december  and  respectively 
these balances consider consolidated cash and short term investment balances  which includes balances held by orion 
the consolidated policyholders surplus of orion s insurance subsidiaries is  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company s statutory operating leverage ratios of net premiums written to policyholders surplus is and at december  and  respectively

the net proceeds from the offering were  of which  was used to repay all of orion s debt under its bank loan agreement 
the terms of orion s indentures for its  of senior notes due and its  of senior notes due limit the amount of liens and guarantees by the company  and the company s ability to incur secured indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the senior notes 
management does not believe that these limitations unduly restrict the company s operations or limit orion s ability to pay dividends on its stock 
at december  the company is in compliance with the terms of its senior note indentures 
management believes that the company continues to have substantial sources of capital and liquidity from the capital markets and bank borrowings
