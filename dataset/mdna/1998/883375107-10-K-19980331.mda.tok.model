item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics was founded in and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of theraseed r  a rice sized device used for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in a one time  minimally invasive procedure 
in  the company received fda clearance for its principal product  theraseed r  for use in any solid localized tumor 
sales increased in and in due to increased and reliable production from the company s cyclotrons and increased demand for theraseed r as a result of growing market acceptance of this treatment alternative for prostate cancer 
production of pd  the radioisotope supplying the therapeutic radiation of theraseed r  has always been a controlling factor in the company s efforts to generate sales 
to increase its control over the timely and consistent availability  quality and cost of pd  the company converted from reactor produced pd to an alternative means of producing pd using a cyclotron 
in  the company contracted for the purchase of a cyclotron for in house production of pd after the cyclotron was delivered and reliable production of pd was demonstrated  the company discontinued its reliance on outside vendors for irradiation services 
in view of the scale of the investment necessary to add cyclotrons  the time and effort required to develop the production process  and the company s limited access to debt and equity capital  the company undertook a slow and measured roll out of its theraseed r product 
management focused primarily on the careful development of relationships with the physician community and on ensuring that the company s production capabilities could meet demand for its product 
the company added additional cyclotrons in   and for a total of four cyclotrons 
four additional cyclotrons are scheduled to become operational in and six in because a cyclotron does not become available for production until approximately months after it is ordered  the accuracy of the company s long term plans can significantly affect its results of operations 
the delivery of cyclotrons prior to a commensurate increase in demand could adversely impact margins  while inadequate cyclotron capacity could limit the company s ability to meet demand and achieve maximum sales growth 
the company is well underway on a million capital expansion project that includes the purchase of four additional cyclotrons and the construction of a new production facility 
although no assurances can be given  management expects that one new cyclotron will become operational in april   or shortly thereafter and the next three becoming operational at three month intervals 
contracts were signed for six additional cyclotrons to be delivered in again  while no assurances can be given  management expects one to be operational at the end of the first quarter  three additional by the end of third quarter  and two more by the end of the fourth quarter of  or shortly thereafter 
each of these cyclotrons  including the facility to house each  are estimated to cost less than  on may  the company entered into a sales and marketing agreement with indigo medical  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  granting the exclusive worldwide right to market and sell theraseed r for the treatment of prostate cancer 
under the terms of the agreements  indigo has assumed responsibility for the education and training of urologists  radiation oncologists and other personnel involved in the use of theraseed r as well as all other sales and marketing activities 
the company continues to be responsible for all manufacturing and distribution for theraseed r 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
market acceptance of the company s theraseed r treatment alternative for prostate cancer grew during concurrently  the company was able to reliably increase production from its cyclotron based manufacturing and thereby take advantage of increased demand 
sales also reflect that the company had four cyclotrons available during much of to meet sales demand as compared to only two cyclotrons throughout licensing fees represent royalty payments with respect to the company s licensed therasphere r technology 
management does not expect licensing fees to become material in the foreseeable future 
see note f of notes to financial statements 
cost of product sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to incremental staffing and cyclotron related costs 
staffing increases were necessary to respond to and anticipate sales growth 
cyclotron operating costs and depreciation increased as all four of the company s cyclotrons were in service by february  as cyclotrons come on line  margins decline because each machine represents excess capacity for a period while carrying its full component of fixed costs  including depreciation 
as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in this decrease resulted from economies of scale 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
primary contributors to this increase were legal and professional fees and compensation and related expense 
legal and professional expense fees increased as the company completed the theragenics indigo sales and marketing agreement and initiated legal action against a small company founded by former employees 
compensation and related expenses rose as the number of employees increased and salaries were increased reflecting the larger scope of the company s operations and the need to attract and retain qualified employees 
there were also higher expenditures in a number of areas representing support for higher sales levels 
despite these increases  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in due to economies of scale 
during the periods presented  the company had no ongoing pure research function 
as in the past  much of the development component of research and development of product and processes is incorporated in the manufacturing area and therefore is included in the cost of goods sold category 
management may choose to develop a more traditional research and development program if and when appropriate opportunities are identified and resources are in place 
other income expense during the periods presented consist principally of interest income  interest expense and the write off of unamortized loan costs as a result of loan refinancing 
interest income jumped dramatically  reflecting interest on funds received as a result of the secondary stock offering completed in april  since these funds will largely be used to fund the company s expansion program in and  management expects other income to return to levels consistent with historical amounts 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately in and approximately in liquidity and capital resources during  and  the company s principal cash needs related to capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity 
to manufacture theraseed r  the company purchases  installs and operates cyclotrons  which involves significant capital investment 
the company has funded its capacity expansions in and  principally from cash flows from operations and bank borrowings  and in from cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the secondary offering of common stock completed in april  the company had cash and short term investments of million at december   compared to million at december  working capital was million at december   this compares to million at year end  which included million representing the current portion of long term obligations 
cash provided by operating activities was  million and million during and  respectively 
these amounts primarily represent net income supplemented in by an increase in income tax payable and trade accounts payable  and in all years by the tax sheltering effects of depreciation and deferred tax expense 
offsetting these items were increases in accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  consisting in each of these years primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
spending in represents the continuation of a project to add cyclotrons three and four to the facility  the purchase of acres of land for the company s expansion project and spending on an assembly automation project 
spending in primarily represents the beginning of a project to add four cyclotrons and a new manufacturing facility having an estimated total cost of approximately million 
as of december   approximately million had been spent on this expansion project and less than million on other capital projects 
theragenics invested in marketable securities and held million of those securities at december  as disclosed in note b in the notes to financial statements attached hereto 
on january   the company entered into six agreements  each for the purchase of one additional cyclotron 
each cyclotron  including the facility to house it  is expected to cost less than million 
the company has made payments to date on these six cyclotrons totaling approximately million as of march  cash provided used by financing activities was  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities relates principally to bank borrowings and repayments thereof  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and in  proceeds from the secondary placement of common stock  and common stock sold to indigo medical as part of a sales and marketing agreement 
management intends to continue its efforts toward increasing its pd production capacity 
as such  over the next two fiscal years  the company intends to construct facilities  purchase cyclotrons  purchase other production equipment  invest in research and development  invest in automation  and provide for working capital and general corporate needs 
management believes that current cash balances  cash from future operations and its credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  management may choose to raise those funds through other methods of financing as appropriate 
year issue some computer systems used today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
consequently  such systems may recognize a date of as the year instead of year this may cause many computer systems to fail or create inaccurate results unless corrective measures are taken 
we are currently implementing  or we have plans to implement  upgrades to computer systems to properly recognize dates after december  the financial impact associated with upgrades to systems to address the year issue is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year
