item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june   is included on pages f through f of exhibit b  financial information  to the company s notice of annual meeting and proxy statement for fiscal year and is incorporated herein by reference in exhibit number the company sets forth below cautionary statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of many of the factors described below are discussed in both current and prior company securities and exchange commission filings and to the extent not otherwise discussed in forward looking statements should be considered in assessing the various risks associated with the company s conduct of its business and financial condition 
risks which may impact the accuracy of the company s forward looking statements include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following i the company s rsrm contract for nasa s space shuttle program is subject to substantial performance and financial risks 
without cause  the contract may be terminated for the convenience of the us government government 
deliveries under the contract may be delayed or extended at the election of the government 
future space shuttle launches are highly dependent upon the international space station 
delays in space station components may delay launches and affect the rsrm production rates 
congress may change the funding available to the contract 
actions by the government or the company may make the amount of the contract fee already booked inappropriate  thus causing a retroactive award fee adjustment including possible reimbursement to the government of fees the government has paid to the company 
the current buy iii contract is expected to continue until fiscal year deliveries are expected to be completed by the company is negotiating the buy iv contract with expected production of thirty five flight sets through the terms of the company s buy iv award fee have not been finalized  but are expected to be similar to the structure of the buy iii award fee 
the profitability and cash flow of the buy iv contract  however  may not be at current levels 
nasa s privatization of the space shuttle program through united space alliance could adversely impact the company s rsrm contract in the out years 
nasa has also shown initial interest in developing a liquid fly back booster lfbb as an alternative propulsion source or as a replacement for the company s rsrm motors 
ii the company s maintenance of non rsrm space and defense contracts including the minuteman regrain and commercial launch vehicle programs collectively programs and the availability and award of future programs with the government and prime contractors are subject to the risk of termination or renegotiation by the government or failure of such programs to be funded 
the level of minuteman production may be impacted by international treaty negotiations limiting the deployment of icbm s 
the company s ability to successfully compete for and win new programs or retain current programs is also dependent on the availability of program funding  competition by others with the company for such programs on price  quality  technology  facilities  delivery  and product performance  changes in congressional funding objectives  and federal agency demand and program management  including but not limited to  program termination  consolidation  or privatization 
other risks include the company s ability to successfully manage current programs  obtaining or retaining new and existing programs  and the profitability of such programs with satisfactory return on investment on lower prices  costs  and unit volumes in a shrinking and competitive government procurement environment 
competitive propulsion systems and technologies  as well as ballistic missile surplus propulsion inventory both domestic and foreign  can adversely impact the success of the company s commercial launch programs and ability to compete successfully for government strategic and tactical propulsion programs 
iii the products and services sold by the company to domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are subject to the risks of the cyclical nature of the aircraft market and the phase of such cycle at any point in time 
delay or changes in aircraft and component orders and build schedules may impact the future demand for company products  delivery  and profitability 
the company s major aerospace customers are large and may exercise their market power among a number of vendors  including the company  competing for their business by exerting pricing pressure  delivery  inventory  and unit volume requirements 
risks to the company include management s ability to maintain both product and manufacturing qualifications  meet the needs of its major customers and regulatory agencies and maintain or improve margins and return on investment in light of competitive pricing pressures  unit demand and product qualification  and product substitutions by major customers 
the company s potential inability to maintain product pricing  as well as availability  delivery  and service are important risk factors 
iv the products and services sold by the company for domestic and international  and industrial commercial markets  primarily through the fastening systems business segment and the investment castings segment represented by the company s percent equity investment in howmet  are subject to the risks of the level of general economic activity and industry capacity in mature industrial markets  product applications  and technology associated primarily with aircraft  automotive  transportation  power generation  construction  and other industrial applications 
the fastening systems segment is subject to the cyclical and economic nature of the automotive industry and the market power of large automotive original equipment manufacturers as to competition among vendors for pricing  delivery  inventory and unit volumes 
the company s business can also be affected by factors such as management s ability to successfully expand new and existing product lines  including the successful integration of the jacobson manufacturing operations  to improve margins and returns on investment by successfully implementing asset management  pricing and cost reduction strategies 
the company s ability to maintain competitive products  pricing  availability  delivery  and service are important factors in maintaining customer relationships and effectively competing with other manufacturers 
v additional future increases in ownership percentage of howmet will  in part  be dependent on the favorable operational and financial performance  favorable economic conditions  price of howmet common stock  and the availability of financing at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms from the capital markets at the time the company exercises its option to acquire the balance of the equity ownership of howmet from carlyle 
significant intangible values comprise howmet asset values  which may not be realized by stockholders including the company if howmet were sold or liquidated 
howmet remains liable as the original issuer of the purchase notes  as defined in the notes to the company s financial statements  due to be paid in january of  held in a restricted trust secured by pechiney international  a french company secured by million in letters of credit issued by banque nationale de paris  a french bank with a standard poor s rating of a secured by substantially identical back up letters of credit issued by caisse des depots et consignations  a french bank with a standard poor s aaa credit rating 
in the event that pechiney fails to meet its obligations under the restricted trust and both banks fail to meet their obligations under their respective letters of credit  such events  which management believes are remote  would have a material effect on howmet s financial condition and value of the company s percent equity ownership of howmet 
vi supplier and customer product qualifications are important to the company as a purchaser and as a supplier 
as a supplier  loss or failure to maintain product or manufacturing qualifications from major customers including the government and major commercial aerospace and aircraft manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers may result in loss of markets and business for the company 
qualified vendors  component parts  and raw materials qualifications are important to the company in the manufacture of its products including major propulsion systems such as the rsrm 
vendor  component parts and raw materials may be limited  and the loss of a major vendor as a supplier  has the potential to cause a major and material delay in production or program performance 
vii raw materials used by the company s investment castings and fastening systems segments include a number of metals and minerals  including titanium  hafnium  aluminum  nickel  cobalt  molybdenum and chromium  among others 
prices of these materials can be volatile  and the company engages in forward purchases of some of these materials under certain market conditions  and passes certain price fluctuations through to customers pursuant to its long term agreements 
the company ordinarily does not otherwise attempt to hedge the price risk of its raw materials 
for some of the supplies and raw materials it purchases  including certain metals  the company has no fixed price contracts or arrangements 
commercial deposits of certain metals  such as cobalt  nickel  titanium  and molybdenum  that are required for the alloys used in precision castings and aircraft  are found in only a few parts of the world  and for certain materials only single sources are readily available 
the availability and prices of these metals and other materials may be influenced by private or governmental cartels  changes in world politics  unstable governments in exporting nations  production interruptions  inflation and other factors 
although the company has not experienced significant shortages of its supplies and raw materials  there can be no assurance that such shortages will not occur in the future 
any such shortages or prices fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
viii the company maintains a policy of hedging foreign currency transactions and economic exposures for foreign currency denominated obligations 
the company does not hedge against net asset values for its foreign investments attributed to its foreign subsidiaries valued in local currencies 
to the extent the company s foreign revenue base grows and net asset base expands  as the result of the company s increased foreign business activity  the company s exposure to adverse foreign currency rate movement increases 
the company s foreign currency risk exposure is also subject to the stability of the foreign currency of the country where the company maintains foreign operations or does business 
the company seeks to minimize the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements through its hedging policy 
the success of the hedging policy in preventing an adverse financial result on operations in any accounting period cannot be assured 
ix the company has a decentralized information systems is function  in which each of its three major business segments operate autonomously with its own is organization 
the thiokol propulsion is organization is moving toward completing a scheduled three year year date readiness project that addresses all major production applications supported by the propulsion systems segment 
the project s objective is to identify all date related program logic  to correct  replace or eliminate all date processing problems  and to test and implement into production the corrected application software 
the project is on schedule with over percent of the planned work completed 
the project is expected to be completed by december   with system wide testing activity occurring after that date 
the estimated cost for the project is million  which is being expensed as incurred over the three year life of the project 
the thiokol propulsion is organization has requested its vendors of application or operating system software products to provide a status and commitment regarding the readiness of their respective products for the year most responses indicate that vendors have solutions either in place or have scheduled future versions to correct this problem 
huck fastening systems uses primarily standard commercial  vendor supported application software products 
these systems can be made year compliant by upgrading to current versions of the vendors software products 
huck recently purchased a new enterprise resource planning erp software product that is year and euro compliant and will be implemented at all huck sites over the next three years 
during the next twelve months  approximately one half of huck s facilities will be converted to the new software  thereby avoiding the need to upgrade the old systems at those sites to achieve year readiness 
all remaining sites  meanwhile  will be made compliant by upgrading to current versions of the existing software products as described above 
this dual approach will address all year readiness requirements by june  those costs associated with software purchases and with year readiness are estimated at million 
howmet investment castings is is actively working its year readiness issues 
all date logic concerns on its central mainframe applications and distributed server applications have been identified and remedial action to correct or replace the problematic code is currently under way 
howmet is currently reviewing its various remote plant facilities to identify and begin implementing any needed changes to both local business applications and shop floor control systems 
all corrective action projects are expected to be completed by june  to date  no material risk of non compliance has been identified 
howmet has also initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers  including raw materials  services  and computer hardware software suppliers  and large customers to determine the extent to which howmet s manufacturing processes and interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
early responses have indicated no significant problems 
additionally  howmet is installing several commercial application software products  at both its central facility and at certain plant sites  to further address their year readiness 
howmet s total estimated year cost is million  spread over the three year life of the project 
during  all three business segments will focus on further evaluation of customer and supplier readiness  embedded processor systems  risk assessment  worst case scenarios and contingency planning 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
x the company is assessing the impact of the euro conversion on its business operations and is currently implementing a strategy which will allow it to operate in a euro environment during the transition period  january  december   and after full euro conversion  post july  the company does not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on its computer software plans 
computer software changes necessary to comply with the year issue are generally compliant with the euro conversion issue 
enterprise resource planning erp software being implemented at huck and howmet as a part of year readiness will be euro compliant 
no additional costs related to euro compliance are expected for the erp software 
some expense is anticipated for minor system modifications  but is not expected to be material 
the company s payroll system has not yet been examined and will require modifications to be euro compliant 
the costs of payroll systems modifications are also undetermined 
the company expects no euro conversion impact to its thiokol propulsion business segment 
the company does not expect any material impact to its contracting policies or competitive position on its three business segments as a result of the euro conversion 
the company is reviewing the impact of the euro conversion on its foreign exchange exposure position 
the company does not expect any significant changes to its current hedging policy and does not expect any significant increases in its foreign exchange exposure 
until the company completes its assessment of the euro conversion impact  there can be no assurance that the euro impact will not have a material impact on the overall business operations of the company
