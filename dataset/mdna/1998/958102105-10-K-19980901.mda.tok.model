item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview western digital is a leading supplier of hard drives for desktop and enterprise computers 
the hard drive industry is intensely competitive and has experienced a great deal of growth  entry and exit of firms  and technological change over the past several years 
this industry is characterized as a high tech commodity business with short product life cycles  dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel  significant expenditures for product development and recurring periods of under and over supply 
the company s operating results during deteriorated primarily as a result of increased competition  particularly in the desktop storage market  and operating issues resulting from an accelerated transition from thin film recording head technology to mr head technology 
although the business environment was challenging in  the company continued to invest significantly in its desktop and enterprise hard drive businesses 
in june  the company entered into a broad based hard drive component supply and technology licensing agreement with ibm ibm agreement for its desktop pc products 
as a result of the ibm agreement  the company expects to begin shipping desktop hard drives featuring gmr heads in the first six months of calendar the company anticipates that these hard drives will augment western digital s product offerings thereby improving its competitiveness in terms of time to market  time to capacity and cost 
the company has invested heavily in its enterprise storage business over the past few years and has built its share of this market to approximately as of the end of the company is planning a significant increase in its research and development spending during to transform western digital into a full line supplier of enterprise hard drives by the middle of the company expects that having a full product line will help attract new oem customers  thereby increasing sales and operating profit 
results of operations comparison of  and in  the company reported net income of million compared with net income of million for and a net loss of million for the increase in operating income from to resulted from a increase in revenues  a two percentage point increase in gross margin  and a two percentage point decline in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
the deterioration in operating performance from to occurred because of a decrease in revenues  a percentage point decline in gross profit margin and a three percentage point increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
net income for included a one time  pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s multimedia products business 
the net loss in included special charges of million recorded in the second quarter  primarily to cost of sales  and million of costs recorded in the fourth quarter to research and development r d principally related to the start up of the ibm agreement 
the million of special charges include estimated component cancellation charges  inventory and other asset write downs  costs incurred on terminated mobile pc engineering programs  and other estimated incremental costs related to the production  sale  and accelerated wind down of thin film products and ramp up of products with mr heads 
sales of hard drive products were  and billion in  and  respectively 
beginning in  of the company s revenues were generated from the sale of hard drive products 
unit shipments increased from to  but declining average selling prices asp reduced the to hard drive revenue growth rate to 
the higher unit volume in primarily resulted from increased business with oems and  to a lesser extent  incremental unit shipments to resellers 
also in  the company began shipping products from its enterprise storage product line 
during  unit shipments decreased which  combined with reductions in the asps of hard drive products due to an intensely competitive hard drive business environment  resulted in a decline in hard drive revenues from gross profit margins were as follows hard drive products microcomputer products overall the increase in gross profit margin for hard drive products in was primarily the result of a change in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher capacity desktop storage products combined with initial shipments of enterprise storage products 
the company began shipping products from its enterprise storage product line in these products have a higher average gross margin percentage than the company s desktop storage products 
also contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin for hard drive products were year over year reductions in the average cost of the company s desktop storage products 
the reduction in gross profit margin in was primarily related to unusually severe competitive pricing pressures experienced in the desktop storage market during the last three quarters of the company also experienced higher assembly costs associated with extending the life of thin film head technology in desktop storage products and the accelerated transition to hard drives utilizing mr heads 
the million of special charges recorded in the second quarter of also contributed to the decline in gross profit margin 
partially offsetting these amounts were incremental sales of the company s higher margin enterprise storage products 
r d expense was million  or of revenues  million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues in  and  respectively 
r d expense remained consistent from to as higher expenditures incurred to develop desktop  enterprise and mobile hard drive products were offset by the elimination of expenditures related to the mcp businesses which were sold in r d expenses declined as a percentage of revenues primarily as a result of the higher revenue base in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars spent from to was primarily associated with higher expenditures to support the development of hard drives for the desktop and enterprise storage markets and certain costs recorded in the fourth quarter related principally to the start up of the ibm agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  or of revenues  million  or of revenues and million  or of revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in the absolute dollars of sg a expenses from to was primarily due to incremental selling  marketing and other related expenses in support of the higher revenue levels and higher expenditures for the company s pay for performance and profit sharing plans 
the decline in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues in was primarily due to the higher revenue base in the decrease in sg a expense from to was primarily the result of lower expenses for the company s pay for performance and profit sharing plans  partially offset by higher expenses associated with implementing the company s new computer information systems 
net interest income was  and million in  and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income from to was primarily attributable to interest expense incurred on the company s recently funded long term debt consisting of a million term loan  which is part of the company s revolving credit and term loan facility senior bank facility  and accrual of original issue discount on the company s convertible subordinated debentures due debentures 
no debt was outstanding during either of the comparable periods 
partially offsetting this decrease was incremental interest income earned on the cash and cash equivalents balance in  which was higher than historical levels due to the proceeds from the sale of the debentures and borrowings under the senior bank facility 
the company s effective tax rate for and resulted primarily from the earnings of certain subsidiaries which are taxed at substantially lower tax rates as compared with united states statutory rates and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the tax rate from to reflects a change in earnings among the company s subsidiaries operating in various tax jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit recorded in represents the expected benefit of loss carrybacks  partially offset by provisions for income taxes recorded in certain jurisdictions that had positive earnings 
economy of asian countries several asian countries recently have had large economic downturns and significant declines in the value of their currencies relative to the us dollar 
the asian crisis has reduced the market for the company s products and may have helped some asian hard drive companies become more competitive since they can pay some of their costs in devalued currency while receiving their revenues in us dollars 
the company is unable to predict what effect  if any  the factors associated with the asian crisis will have on foreign economic conditions  the company s customers or vendors or the company s ability to compete in asian markets

application of this accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
year the company has considered the impact of year issues on its products  computer systems and applications and has developed a remediation process 
remediation activities are underway  and the company expects compliance and testing to be completed by june expenditures related to the year project  which include normal replacement of existing capital assets were approximately million in and are expected to amount to approximately million in total 
for an additional discussion of year issues  see part ii  item  risk factors affecting the company and or the hard drive industry year issue 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared with million at june  net cash used for operating activities was million during cash flows resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable and lower inventories were more than offset by cash used to fund a decrease in current liabilities and the net loss net of non cash charges 
other significant uses of cash during were capital expenditures of million and payments of million to settle certain put option arrangements entered into in connection with the company s open market stock repurchase program 
the capital expenditures were incurred primarily in connection with the transition to desktop and enterprise hard drives featuring mr head technology  normal replacement of existing assets  acquisition and development of the company s new computer information systems and acquisition of land for the company s new headquarters 
partially offsetting these uses of cash was million received in connection with the issuance of the debentures and borrowings under the senior bank facility 
in addition  million was received in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan espp purchases 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will total approximately million and will relate to retooling of the company s hard drive assembly lines in order to accommodate new technologies and normal replacement of existing assets 
the senior bank facility pursuant to which bankboston  na and other lending institutions are providing a million revolving credit line and a million term loan  both of which expire in january  is secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventory  of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and the other assets excluding real property of the company 
at the option of the company  borrowings bear interest at either libor plus a margin determined by a total debt funded ratio or a base rate  with option periods of one to six months 
the senior bank facility  as amended in february and june  requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  prohibits the payment of dividends and contains a number of other restrictive covenants 
as of the date hereof  the million term loan was funded  but there were no borrowings under the revolving credit line 
on february   the company received gross proceeds of million before the initial purchasers discount from a private offering of zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in the principal amount at maturity of the debentures is billion 
the debentures are subordinated to all senior debt  are convertible into million shares of the company s common stock at the rate of shares per  principal amount at maturity  are redeemable at the option of the company any time after february  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption  and will be repurchased by the company  at the option of the holder  as of february   february  or february   or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption 
on december   the company purchased approximately acres of land in irvine  california for approximately million 
the company intends to negotiate lease financing for construction of a new corporate headquarters on this site 
the new headquarters facility is expected to lower the company s occupancy costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in entering into a leasing arrangement for this property on terms that will be satisfactory to the company and other alternatives available to the company upon expiration of its current headquarters lease could be more costly 
the company believes its current cash balances  combined with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs at least through the company has viewed the revolving credit line portion of its senior bank facility as a source of cash to meet its longer term working capital requirements  if needed 
the company s recent financial results and current condition have reduced availability under the senior bank facility  and it is uncertain  based on information currently available to the company  whether the company will be in compliance with certain financial covenants under the senior bank facility at the end of its first quarter of therefore  the company has been negotiating a new senior credit facility to replace the senior bank facility and has signed a non binding term sheet 
the new credit facility would have more flexible borrowing requirements and covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the negotiations required to obtain this new credit facility or that the senior bank facility will continue to be available  and the company s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the heading risk factors affecting the company and or the hard drive industry 
risk factors affecting the company and or the hard drive industry highly competitive industry the desktop portion of the hard drive industry consists of many competitors of various sizes and financial resources and is intensely competitive 
the desktop hard drive industry is currently experiencing a period of sustained oversupply and unusually severe pricing pressures that the company expects to continue for at least the first six months of  although the current conditions in this market make it difficult to forecast the timing of any change in competitive conditions 
during and  the company significantly increased its market share in the desktop hard drive market  but the company s market share eroded in  primarily due to competitive conditions in the hard drive industry with resulting cutbacks in production  the timing of the company s transition from thin film to magneto resistive mr head technology and certain manufacturing and performance issues encountered as the company pushed thin film head technology to its limits 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover recent market share losses or avoid further erosion of market share 
seagate  quantum  ibm  maxtor  fujitsu and samsung are the company s major competitors in the data storage business  and maxtor  fujitsu and samsung have recently gained significant market share in the desktop market 
the current intensely competitive conditions in this market make it difficult to forecast near term operating results 
this competitive environment has adversely affected the company s operating results for  and the company expects these conditions to continue for at least the first half of the enterprise portion of the hard drive industry is more concentrated than the desktop portion  with the largest competitor  seagate  having market share in excess of until the recent entrance of quantum and the company as competitors 
the other major competitors in this market are ibm and fujitsu 
the number of competitors in this market has increased with the recent entry of quantum and the company  and competition may continue to grow if maxtor enters the enterprise market 
with more competitors  price competition in the enterprise market is greater than in the past  and the company expects that price competition will continue to increase  with resulting pressure on margins 
in general  the unit price for a given product in both the desktop and enterprise markets decreases over time as increases in industry supply and cost reductions occur and as technological advancements are achieved 
cost reductions result primarily from volume efficiencies  component cost reductions  manufacturing experience and design enhancements that are generally realized over the life of a product 
competitive pressures and customer expectations compel manufacturers to pass these cost reductions along as reductions in selling prices 
the rate of general price decline accelerates when some competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity  liquidate excess inventories or attempt to gain market share 
competition and continuing price erosion can adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results in any given quarter 
often  such adverse effects cannot be anticipated until late in the quarter  as happened during rapid technological change and product development the demands of hard drive customers for greater storage capacity and higher performance have led to short product life cycles  which require the company to constantly develop and introduce new drive products on a cost effective and timely basis 
the company s ability to fund research and development to support rapid technological change depends upon its operating results and cash flows  reductions in such funding could impair the company s ability to innovate and compete 
because of the company s anticipated reliance upon ibm technology for new high end desktop pc products  the company will be subject to risks associated with ibm s research and development as well as its own 
see technology license and component supply transaction with ibm 
mr heads  which enable higher capacity per hard drive than conventional thin film or mig inductive heads  became the leading recording head technology during several of the company s major competitors incorporated mr head technology into their products much earlier than the company and  with higher capacity drives using mr heads  some of the company s competitors achieved time to market leadership with certain mr products 
the company substantially completed its transition of desktop hard drives to mr head technology by the end of the company continues to manufacture hard drives with thin film inductive heads for the lower capacity points of the enterprise market 
failure of the company to regain time to market leadership with products incorporating mr head technology in a timely manner  to qualify these products with key oem customers  or to produce these products in sufficient volume could cause further erosion of the company s market share and have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
mr head technology has inherent areal density advantages which have resulted in an increase in the slope of the areal density curve  ie  areal density is increasing at a more rapid rate than before 
because of the component cost savings inherent in increases in areal density  this more rapid increase has shortened product life cycles and enhanced the importance of time to market leadership 
use of gmr heads will result in a further increase in areal density  and although the integration of gmr heads in hard drives is not expected to be as complex or difficult as the transition from thin film to mr technology  the company needs to achieve time to market leadership with hard drives incorporating gmr heads 
failure to achieve time to market leadership could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
due to short product life cycles  the company regularly engages in new product qualification with its customers 
this customer qualification process is usually complicated  difficult and lengthy 
any failure or delay by the company in qualifying new products with customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s continued success in the enterprise hard drive market is heavily dependent on the successful development  timely introduction and market acceptance of new products  and failure to achieve such success could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s current line of enterprise products is based on a scsi low profile high drive with capacity points up to gbs 
these products serve approximately of the existing enterprise market  however  the company must expand its product line to include designs for half high high drives  fc al interface and  rpm in order to become a full line supplier in the enterprise market 
development  design  manufacturing and acceptance of these new enterprise products are subject to the various business risks discussed herein which are applicable to all hard drive product development 
additionally  the company is facing staffing challenges  since additional engineers must be hired to complete the design and development process for the expansion of the enterprise product line 
competition worldwide for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance the company will be able to attract and retain such additional personnel 
the company is currently in the product design and development phase of these additional enterprise products and expects to bring them to market during the next months 
if the company is unable to build its enterprise infrastructure quickly enough to support this development schedule or encounters development delays or quality issues  it may miss the time to market windows on these new enterprise products  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company experiences fluctuations in manufacturing yields that can materially affect the company s operations  particularly in the start up phase of new products or new manufacturing processes  and also at the end of a technology s life cycle  when refinements designed to reach the product s technical limits can result in tighter manufacturing tolerances 
with the continued pressures to shorten the time required to introduce new products  the company must accelerate production learning curves to shorten the time to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs 
the company s future is therefore dependent upon its ability to develop new products  qualify these new products with its customers  successfully introduce these products to the market on a timely basis and commence volume production to meet customer demands 
if not carefully planned and executed  the transition to new products may adversely affect sales of existing products and increase risk of inventory obsolescence 
a delay in the introduction or production of more cost effective and or more advanced products also can result in lower sales and lower gross margins 
because of rapid technological changes  the company anticipates that sales of older products will decline as in the past and that sales of new products will continue to account for a significant portion of its sales in the future 
failure of the company to execute its strategy of achieving time to market in sufficient volume with new products  or any delay in the introduction of advanced and cost effective products  could result in significantly lower revenue and gross margins 
some of these factors have adversely affected the company in connection with the maturation of and transition from thin film recording head technology to mr head technology 
inability to introduce or achieve volume production of competitive products on a timely basis has in the past and could in the future adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
advances in magnetic  optical or other technologies  or the development of entirely new technologies  could result in the creation of competitive products that have better performance and or lower prices than the company s products 
companies such as terastor and seagate are currently developing optically assisted recording technologies 
the initial products from such companies are expected to be high capacity and high price 
based on preliminary announcements  these products also appear to have lower performance attributes than the current enterprise storage products 
the optically assisted recording approaches used by these two companies are different at this time and have created some short term confusion in the industry 
accordingly  the company s strategy is to view optically assisted recording as a potentially valid solution at some point in time  but to assume that the hard drive technologies currently in use will serve the company for the foreseeable future 
however  if the company s assumption proves to be wrong  the company could be late in its integration of optically assisted recording technology  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
technology license and component supply transaction with ibm implementation of the ibm agreement presents several significant challenges to the company including the need to adapt ibm s product designs to the high volume  fast cycle time production environment that is necessary to achieve the cost efficiencies required to compete in the high volume desktop market 
while the company intends to take advantage of ibm s technological leadership to develop market leading hard drive products  the availability of ibm technology does not assure the company s success 
successful development of hard drive products utilizing ibm technology will require the company s engineers to integrate ibm technology and product designs into western digital products while continuing to conduct significant independent research and development activities 
the ibm agreement does not alleviate the research and development risk that has been inherent in the company s business  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in translating ibm technologies or components into successful products 
additionally  since ibm will be the sole supplier of the head component for these desktop drives  the company s business and financial results would be adversely affected if the heads manufactured by ibm fail to satisfy the company s quality requirements or if ibm is unable to meet the company s volume or delivery requirements 
western digital believes that ibm s current and planned manufacturing capacity should be adequate to meet the company s forecasted requirements 
however  the future growth of sales of hard drives with ibm technology is dependent upon  among other things  ibm continuing to devote substantial financial resources to property  plant  equipment and working capital to support the manufacture of the components  as to which there can be no assurance 
the company entered into the ibm agreement with the expectation that ibm will continue to lead the hard drive industry in areal density and performance and that the company will be able to translate that leadership into time to market and time to volume leadership in the desktop pc hard drive market 
if ibm does not maintain its areal density leadership  the company may not be able to realize the competitive cost advantages in the high volume portion of the market that result from such leadership 
although the ibm agreement contains certain restrictions on ibm s ability to license the technology covered by it to third parties  the ibm agreement is not exclusive  and other hard drive manufacturers may also have access to heads produced by ibm and possibly to ibm designs and technology 
the ibm agreement has a minimum three year term with the parties having the right to agree to continue the relationship for future products subject to mutually acceptable terms and conditions 
if a party breaches the agreement or becomes subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings  the other party may terminate the ibm agreement 
the ibm agreement may also be terminated by a party upon a change of control of the other party  subject to certain conditions 
fluctuating product demand demand for the company s hard drive products depends on the demand for the computer systems manufactured by its customers and on storage upgrades to computer systems  which in turn are affected by computer system product cycles  end user demand for increased storage capacity and prevailing economic conditions 
although market research indicates that total computer system unit shipments are expected to continue to grow for the next several years  demand may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations have in the past and may in the future result in deferral or cancellation of orders for the company s products  which could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
the hard drive industry has also experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the company has historically experienced relatively flat demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter  while demand in the second quarter has historically been much higher than in the first quarter 
additionally  product shipments tend to be greatest in the third month of each quarter 
any failure by the company to accurately match its product build plans to customer demand for any particular period could adversely affect the company s operating results for that period  as happened during customer concentration and changing customer models high volume customers for hard drives are concentrated among a small number of oems  distributors and retailers 
although the company believes its relationships with key customers such as these are generally good  the concentration of sales to a relatively small number of major customers represents a business risk that loss of one or more accounts could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
customer concentration is especially significant for the company s enterprise business 
the company s customers are generally not obligated to purchase any minimum volume and are generally able to terminate their relationship with the company at will 
the company has experienced reductions in its business  with resulting loss of revenue  with certain oem customers largely as a result of delays and difficulties encountered in the company s transition to mr head technology 
if any such changes in purchase volume or customer relationships continue to result in decreased demand for the company s drives  whether by loss of or delays in orders  the company s financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
the hard drive industry is experiencing changes in its oem customer ordering models 
the trend among computer manufacturers using the build to order model is to utilize a just in time jit inventory management requirements model 
as a result  western digital s customers are holding smaller inventories of components such as hard drives 
this jit ordering requires the company to maintain a certain base stock of product in a location adjacent to its customers manufacturing facilities 
jit ordering complicates the company s inventory management strategies and makes it more difficult to match manufacturing plans with projected customer demand 
the company s failure to manage its inventory in response to jit demands could have an adverse effect on its operating results 
large oems are also considering or have implemented a channel assembly model in which the oem ships a minimal computer system to the dealer or other assembler  and component suppliers such as hard drive manufacturers are requested to ship parts directly to the assembler for installation at its location 
with this model  fragmentation of manufacturing facilities exposes the company to some risk of inventory mismanagement by both the oems and the assemblers 
the shift requires effective inventory management by the company  and any increase in the number of ship to locations may increase freight costs and the number of accounts to be managed 
additionally  if the assemblers are not properly trained in manufacturing processes  it could also increase the number of product returns resulting from damage during assembly or improper installation 
this model requires proper alignment between the oem and the company and requires the company to retain more of its product in inventory 
the company is therefore exposed to increased risk of inventory obsolescence with the channel assembly model as well as the jit model 
the company s oem customer relationships have traditionally been strong  but a material adverse change in an oem relationship could adversely affect demand for the company s products  especially with the impact of these new models 
dependence on suppliers of components the company is dependent on qualified suppliers for components  including recording heads  head stack assemblies  media and integrated circuits 
a number of the components used by the company are available from a single or limited number of outside suppliers 
some of these materials may periodically be in short supply  and the company has  on occasion  experienced temporary delays or increased costs in obtaining these materials 
as a result  the company must allow for significant lead times when procuring certain materials and supplies 
in addition  cancellation of orders for components due to cut backs in production precipitated by market oversupply or transition to new products or technologies can result in payment of significant cancellation charges to suppliers 
because the company is less vertically integrated than its competitors  an extended shortage of required materials and supplies or the failure of key suppliers to meet the company s quality  yield or production requirements could affect the company more severely than competitors 
the company s product development efforts must include components designed by and purchased from third party vendors since the company does not manufacture the components  except for a significant portion of its media  for its hard drives 
the success of the company s products depends in part on the company s ability to acquire and integrate components with leading edge technology 
the successful integration of third party components depends upon the timely availability and quality of components  the ability to integrate the different products from several vendors and management of scheduling and delivery 
the company s success depends on its continued good relationships with key component suppliers  its identification of the most advantageous suppliers for specific products  and its ability to manage the various complexities involved in the integration of components in product development 
additionally  difficult industry conditions may severely impact the company s suppliers 
since the company is not vertically integrated  it may be more adversely affected by the ability of its vendors to survive or adjust to market conditions 
these risks may be particularly acute for products incorporating ibm technology because the company is required to use ibm supplied heads with those products 
see technology license and component supply agreement with ibm 
intellectual property the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  the company receives claims of alleged patent infringement or notice of patents from patent holders  which typically contain an offer to grant the company a license 
on june   papst brought suit against the company in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging infringement by the company of five hard drive motor patents owned by papst 
the patents relate to disk drive motors that the company purchases from motor vendors 
on december   papst dismissed its case without prejudice  but has recently notified the company that it intends to reinstate the suit if the company does not agree to enter into a license agreement with papst 
papst has also put the company on notice with respect to several additional patents 
although the company does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have an adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results  adverse resolution of any intellectual property litigation could subject the company to substantial liabilities and require it to refrain from manufacturing certain products 
in addition  the costs of defending such litigation may be substantial  regardless of the outcome 
the company s success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of its technology 
patents issued to the company may not provide the company with meaningful advantages and may be challenged 
in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights  the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential 
the company believes that its non patentable intellectual property  particularly some of its process technology  is an important factor in its success 
the company relies upon employee  consultant  and vendor non disclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information 
despite these safeguards  to the extent that a competitor of the company is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on the company s technology  it may be difficult or impossible for the company to obtain necessary intellectual property protection in the united states or other countries where such competitor conducts its operations 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
use of estimates the company s management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  accruals for warranty against product defects  price protection and stock rotation reserves on product sold to resellers  and reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the rapidly changing market conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate such accruals and reserves and actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and assumptions 
additionally  actual warranty costs could have a negative impact on the company if the actual rate of drive failure or the cost to repair a drive is greater than what the company used to estimate the warranty expense accrual 
differences between actual results and such estimates and assumptions can result in adverse effects on the company s financial condition or operating results 
potential impact of changing market demands the information services business community is currently debating the thin client architecture or network computer nc model  which emphasizes central servers for data storage and reduces the need for local desktop storage 
although industry analysts expect these products to account for a small fraction of the personal computer market over the next several years  broader than expected adoption of the nc model would reduce demand for desktop storage products while increasing demand for enterprise storage products 
given the company s current business concentration in desktop hard drives and its relatively recent entry into enterprise hard drives  if such a scenario occurred on an accelerated basis  it would place the company at a disadvantage relative to competitors which have a stronger market position in enterprise products 
in addition  certain of the large desktop pc system manufacturers have recently introduced lower cost  lower performance systems principally for the consumer marketplace 
these systems have generally been priced below  and typically contain lower capacity and performance hard drives 
the company currently participates in this market only to a limited extent 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop lower cost hard drives that will successfully compete in this growing market 
foreign sales and manufacturing risks western digital products are currently manufactured in singapore and malaysia 
the company is subject to certain risks associated with foreign manufacturing  including obtaining requisite united states and foreign governmental permits and approvals  currency exchange fluctuations  currency restrictions  political instability  transportation delays  labor problems  trade restrictions  import  export  exchange and tax controls and reallocations  loss or non renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements with foreign tax authorities and changes in tariff and freight rates 
several asian countries recently have had large economic downturns and significant declines in the value of their currencies relative to the us dollar 
the asian crisis has reduced the market for the company s products as well as helped some asian hard drive companies become more competitive since they can pay some of their costs in devalued currency while receiving their revenue in us dollars 
the company is unable to predict what effect  if any  the factors associated with the asian crisis will have on foreign economic conditions  the company s customers or vendors or the company s ability to compete in the asian market 
price volatility of common stock the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products introduced by the company or its competitors  periods of severe pricing pressures  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the hard drive industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock  and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not decline 
future capital needs the hard drive industry is capital intensive  and in order to remain competitive  the company will need to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures  working capital and research and development 
if the company decides to increase its capital expenditures further  or sooner than presently contemplated  or if results of operations do not meet the company s expectations  the company could require additional debt or equity financing  and such equity financing could be dilutive to the company s existing shareholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to the company or available on favorable terms 
the company may also require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient capital  it could be required to curtail its capital equipment and research and development expenditures  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results

foreign exchange contracts the company manages the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain underlying assets  liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies by entering into short term  forward exchange contracts 
with this approach  the company expects to minimize the impact of changing foreign exchange rates on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that all foreign currency exposures will be adequately covered  and that the company s financial condition or operating results will not be affected by changing foreign exchange rates 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs  microprocessors  and embedded date reliant systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if such programs are not corrected  date data concerning the year could cause many systems to fail  lock up or generate erroneous results 
the company considers a product to be year compliant if the product s performance and functionality are unaffected by processing of dates prior to  during and after the year  but only if all products for example hardware  software and firmware used with the product properly exchange accurate date data with it 
as storage devices  the company s hard drives are transparent to year requirements 
the company believes its hard drive products are year compliant  although other products previously sold by the company may not be year compliant 
the company anticipates that litigation may be brought against vendors  including the company  of all component products of systems that are unable to properly manage data related to the year the company s agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s liability for such claims 
it is possible  however  that these measures will not provide protection from liability claims  as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
any such claims  with or without merit  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  customer satisfaction issues and potential lawsuits 
the company has committed personnel and resources to resolve potential year issues  both internally and externally with respect to the company s suppliers and customers for both information technology assets and non information technology assets 
the company is identifying year dependencies in its systems  equipment  and processes and is implementing changes to such systems  updating or replacing such equipment  and modifying such processes to make them year compliant 
the company has completed its assessment of internal year issues and is in the process of remediation of the critical systems 
the company has also initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and financial institutions to evaluate their year compliance plans and state of readiness and to determine whether any year issues will impede the ability of such suppliers to continue to provide goods and services to the company 
as a general matter  the company is vulnerable to its key suppliers failure to remedy their own year issues  which could delay shipments of essential components  thereby disrupting or halting the company s manufacturing operations 
further  the company also relies  both domestically and internationally  upon governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that such suppliers  governmental agencies  financial institutions  or other third parties will not suffer business disruption caused by a year issue 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company is in the process of communicating with its large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company anticipates that its systems  equipment and processes will be substantially year compliant by the end of june although a budget has been established  the cost to the company of achieving year compliance is evolving  however  it is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
while the company currently expects that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems  delays in the company s remediation efforts  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the systems  equipment or processes of the company or its vendors  customers or financial institutions could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the manufacture  delivery or sale of products 
therefore  the company is in the process of developing contingency plans along with its remediation efforts for continuing operations in the event such problems arise
