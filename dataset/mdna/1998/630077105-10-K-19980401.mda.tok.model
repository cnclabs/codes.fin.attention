item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nanometrics is a leading manufacturer of thin film measurement systems for the electronics industry 
the company s primary customers are manufacturers of semiconductors  magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays 
nanometrics film measurement systems use wide wavelength range  high sensitivity optics  proprietary computer software and patented technology to measure thickness  uniformity and chemical properties of film deposited on silicon and other substrates 
the primary applications of these systems is to precisely monitor production processes employed in the fabrication of integrated circuits  magnetic recording heads used in disk drives and flat panel displays commonly used in laptop computers 
the company has made several strategic changes in the business over the past several years which have contributed to revenue growth from million in to million in and positioned the company to further participate in these markets 
such changes include i a shift to direct sales from third party representatives in asia  the united kingdom and the united states  ii an increased emphasis on product development  manufacturing and direct sales in japan  iii a decision to outsource certain system components such as robotics  enabling the company to leverage its technical resources  and iv the development of new products for the semiconductor  magnetic recording head and flat panel display markets 
in addition  the company has developed products that can be used for mm wafers and chemical mechanical polishing 
the company s business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of i semiconductors  ii magnetic recording heads for the read write function on disk drives  and iii flat panel displays 
the demand by such manufacturers is  in turn  dependent on the current and future market demand for i semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors  ii disk drives and computers that utilize disk drives  and iii flat panel displays for use in laptop computers  pagers  cell phones  and a variety of other applications where portability and low power consumption are important 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors  magnetic recording heads  and flat panel displays is also an important factor in the demand for the company s thin film measurement products 
the company believes that its diversification through multiple industry applications of its technology increases the total available market for its products and reduces  to an extent  its exposure to the cyclicality of any individual industry segment 
for example  in fiscal  a decline in sales to manufacturers of semiconductors was offset by increased sales to manufacturers of magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays 
the company derives its revenues from product sales and service  which includes sales of accessories and service of the installed base of products 
in  the company derived of its total net revenues from product sales and of its total net revenues from services 
revenues from product sales and replacement and spare parts are recognized at the time of shipment 
revenues from service work are recognized when performed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ii the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  a small change in the number of systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in revenues in any particular quarter 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s revenue objective for that quarter 
moreover  all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer without penalties 
consequently  the company depends on shipping products in the same quarter that the purchase order is received 
the failure of the company to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments may cause quarterly net revenues to fall significantly short of the company s objectives  which would adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company believes that its quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will grow in future periods or that it will sustain its level of net revenues or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company may  in some future quarter  have operating results that will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
see factors that may affect future operating results significant fluctuations in operating results 
results of operations total net revenues 
total net revenues increased from million in to million in product sales increased by from million in to million in the increase in product sales resulted from stronger worldwide demand for and increased shipments of the company s products  especially its automated products 
service revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to lower sales of parts  services and accessories in asia and the us in due in part to increased functionality and reliability of the company s new products 
total net revenues increased from million in to million in the increase in total net revenues resulted primarily from increased worldwide sales of the company s automated nanospec product family for the semiconductor and magnetic recording head markets and of the automated model flat panel display measurement system particularly in asia 
international revenues  which includes sales by the company s foreign subsidiary in japan  constituted approximately  and of total net revenues for  and  respectively 
the company s domestic revenues of million remained consistent with million in  while international revenues increased from million in to million in in  the company experienced a increase in domestic revenues from million in to million in  while international revenues increased from million in to million in the increases in international revenue were partially offset by the impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen on sales in japan 
gross profit 
the product gross profit margin increased from in to in the increase was caused primarily by higher sales volumes in resulting in lower per unit manufacturing costs 
the service gross profit margin decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in the sales of accessories and upgrades while fixed service costs increased to support the company s growing installed base of systems at customer locations in product gross profit increased from in to in ii primarily because of higher prices resulting from stronger demand for the company s products and a continued decline in fixed operating costs as a percentage of revenues due to higher sales volume 
service gross profit increased to in from in primarily as a result of relatively higher margins on the increased sales of accessories in research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in to support the continued development of new products and product enhancements 
research and development expenses increased by from million in to million in the company is committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believes that new product introductions are required for the company to maintain its competitive position 
during  research and development expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to and in and  respectively 
selling 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in primarily because of higher commission expenses resulting from higher sales levels  the addition of sales and marketing staff and the opening of an office in scotland in selling expenses increased by from million in to million in as a result of both higher sales commission expenses from increased sales levels and the addition of sales personnel in the us and asia 
during selling expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to and in and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in as a result of higher spending associated with the increase in total net revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in due primarily to the addition of a managing director and related expenses in japan 
during general and administrative expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to and in and  respectively 
total other income  net 
total other income  net decreased from  in to  in primarily due to higher royalty income and exchange rate gains in the prior year 
total other income  net decreased by from  in to  in as a result of more favorable exchange rate results in income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in primarily due to an increased benefit from the company s foreign sales corporation 
the effective income tax rates in and exceed the us statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes partially offset by realization of foreign sales corporation benefit 
the effective income tax rate in differed from the us statutory rate because the results for included a million favorable income tax adjustment to reverse the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas income 
the company s income from operations was million and net income was million or per diluted share in compared to income from operations of million and net income of million or per diluted share in and an income from operations of million and net income of million or per diluted share in in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  earnings per share  which requires a dual presentation of basic net income per share eps and diluted eps 
basic eps ii is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution from outstanding dilutive stock options and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan and is unchanged from previously reported eps 
eps for prior periods have been restated to conform to sfas the impact of inflation on the company s results of operations has not been significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  the current ratio at december  was to the company believes working capital including cash and equivalents and short term investments of million will be sufficient to meet its needs at least through the next twelve months 
operating activities during provided net cash of million primarily from net income partially offset by working capital requirements 
financing activities provided cash of  from the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans 
investing activities used cash of million  primarily from the purchase of short term investments in the us during  operating activities provided cash of  primarily from net income partially offset by working capital requirements 
financing activities provided cash of  primarily from the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans 
investing activities used cash of million  primarily from the purchase of short term investments in the us during  operating activities provided cash of million primarily from net income partially offset by working capital requirements 
financing activities provided cash of million primarily from i a loan to the company s japanese subsidiary of million from a bank in japan using the company s building and land in japan as collateral and ii cash of  from the sales of shares under the company s employee stock purchase and option plans  partially offset by  of repayments of long term debt 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily from the investment of proceeds of the bank loan in short term investments in the us the company has evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to the company s business 
these activities may result in product and business investments 
for example  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in january  the company acquired from optical specialties  inc a license to manufacture and sell  worldwide  a system used to measure the critical dimensions and overlay registration errors observed in submicron lithography 
the company may pay up to million in royalties over years if total product sales are million or greater 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with optical specialties  inc to purchase the metrology system product line and certain related assets 
under the agreement  the company is required to pay approximately million in cash for all assets and technology and assumes warranty and service obligations of the existing installed base 
the company expects to fund these payments from its cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements made in this report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following risk factors should be considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company in evaluating the company  its business  financial condition and business prospects 
significant fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
the company anticipates that the factors that may affect its future operating results include the following customer demand for the company s products  which is affected by factors including the cyclicality of the semiconductor  magnetic recording head and flat panel display industries served by the company  patterns of capital spending by customers  technological changes in the markets served by the company and its customers  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  competition  including competitive pressures on product prices and changes in pricing by the company s customers or suppliers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen  the proportion of direct sales versus sales through distributors and representatives  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and releases of products by the company or its competitors  including the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a timely and cost effective basis  the size and timing of acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies and fluctuations in the availability and cost of components and subassemblies 
gross margins may vary materially from quarter to quarter or year to year  based on a number of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of products sold and the absorption of fixed operating costs 
in addition  the company s operating results for the quarter ended march   will be affected by a one time charge relating to the acquisition of in process research and development from optical specialties  inc see liquidity and capital resources 
the impact of the factors listed above and other factors on the company s revenues  financial condition and operating results in any future period cannot be forecasted with any degree of certainty 
based upon these factors  the company believes that its quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and ii operating results could vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will grow in future periods or that it will sustain its level of revenues or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on limited number of systems sales  backlog 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  a small change in the number of systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in revenues in any particular quarter 
all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customers with minimal penalties 
moreover  the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s revenue objective for that quarter 
consequently  the company depends to an extent on shipping products in the same quarter that the purchase order is received 
the failure of the company to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments may cause quarterly net revenues to fall significantly short of the company s objectives  which would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cyclicality of customer industries 
sales to customers in the semiconductor industry represented approximately of the company s total net revenues in  and sales to customers in the magnetic recording head and flat panel display industries represented approximately of total net revenues in the company s business will depend in large part upon the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
in addition  the company s business depends upon the construction of new semiconductor fabrication facilities and improvements to existing fabrication facilities to reduce unit costs or to respond to technological innovation 
the semiconductor industry has been cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic downturns  most recently during the second half of such downturns are characterized by diminished product demand  erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
during downturns  manufacturers typically defer or cancel orders for equipment to conserve cash and reduce expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor industry 
during the downturn in  the company offset declines in orders of its products from the semiconductor industry with increased sales to manufacturers of magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays  however  the company may not be able to do so in future industry downturns 
in addition  the magnetic recording head and flat panel display industries are subject to similar cyclical conditions that could materially affect the market for the company s products and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may also experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to such industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy 
even during periods of reduced revenues  in order to remain competitive the company will be required to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capability  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business financial condition and results of operations during industry downturns or other periods of reduced revenues 
lengthy sales cycle  difficulties in displacing entrenched competitors 
sales of the company s systems depend  in significant part  upon the decision of prospective customers to increase their existing production capacity by building and equipping new fabrication facilities or expanding existing facilities  either of which typically involves a significant capital commitment 
in ii view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase  the company may experience delays in obtaining purchase orders while the customer plans for such expansion  evaluates various thin film measurement systems of the company and its competitors and receive purchase approvals 
due to these and other factors  the company s systems typically have lengthy sales cycles during which the company may expend substantial funds and management effort 
in addition  lengthy sales cycles subject the company to a number of significant risks  including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results over which the company has little or no control 
customers often evaluate several suppliers systems before deciding on the type of thin film measurement system to use 
the company believes that the customer generally relies upon that system for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other thin film measurement system requirements with the same supplier 
accordingly  the company expects to experience difficulty in selling to a particular customer for a significant period of time if that customer already uses a competitor s thin film measurement system 
highly competitive industry 
the market for thin film measurement systems is subject to intense competitive pressure and characterized by rapidly evolving technology 
the company competes on a global basis with both larger and smaller companies in the united states  japan and europe 
the company competes primarily with thin film measurement products from kla tencor corporation  therma wave inc  rudolph technologies  dai nippon screen and toray industries 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
for example  the company expects to face intense competition in the emerging market for mm thin film measurement systems 
new product introductions and enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s systems or otherwise make the company s systems or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
there can be no assurance that company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competitive pressure could lead to reduced demand and lower prices for the company s products  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations  recent economic trends in asia 
international revenues accounted for approximately of the company s total net revenues for the company anticipates that international revenues will continue to account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
the company s international operations are subject to risks inherent in the conduct of international business  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  import or export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in collecting payments due from sales agents or customers  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
furthermore  downturns in foreign capital markets could affect the company s international customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent economic trends  particularly in the asia pacific marketplace  have caused a heightened awareness of the impact of this portion of the world s economy can have on the overall economy 
as the asia pacific market currently represents almost one third of the world s buying power and approximately of the company s sales are to this region  changes in this area s economic growth rate may impact suppliers of product in that market 
while the actual ii magnitude of the business at risk is unknown  it is likely that capital spending in this market will decrease which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the future performance of the company will be dependent  in part  upon its ability to continue to compete successfully in asia  one of the largest markets for the company s products 
the company s ability to compete in this area in the future is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between the region especially japan  korea and taiwan and the united states and the continuing ability of the company to maintain satisfactory relationships with customers and potential customers in the region 
in addition  the japanese market  which is important to the company s sales  has historically been difficult for non japanese companies to penetrate 
although the company has had direct presence in japan since  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or improve its competitive position in japan 
approximately of the company s total net revenues for  were generated by the company s japanese subsidiary and are denominated in japanese yen 
a significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the yen and the us dollar could result in a significant gain or loss being recorded in the company s consolidated statement of income 
a decline in the exchange rate of the yen against the us dollar would result in a decrease in consolidated total net revenues and consolidated net income  whereas an increase in the exchange rate of the yen against the u 
s 
dollar would result in an increase in consolidated total net revenues and consolidated net income 
generally  a change in the exchange rate would have a similar impact on the consolidated net income associated with accounts due between the us parent and the japanese subsidiary 
the company s international revenues in countries except japan are denominated in us dollars and sales to customers may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates which could increase the sales price in local currencies of the company s products 
since the company does not currently engage in currency exchange rate hedging transactions  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the film measurement industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company believes that a key factor in its growth in the past three years has been the success of new product introductions  including the model and model introduced in a key factor in the company s ability to achieve continued growth will be the market success of recent new product introductions  including products for mm wafers  chemical mechanical polishing and large flat panel displays 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to respond to technological change and develop new and enhanced systems and tointroduce these systems at competitive prices and in a timely and cost effective manner 
new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results  since customers may defer ordering product from the company s existing product line in anticipation of the introduction of the new product or product enhancement 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements of existing products by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products or render the company s current product offerings obsolete 
the success of the company in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including product selections  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing and product performance 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  ii reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs and additional service and warranty expenses may result 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
if the company does not successfully introduce new products  the company s business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty of intellectual property rights 
the company s future success and competitive position depends in large part on the company s ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary technology used in its systems 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the extent as do the laws of the united states 
the validity of the company s patents has not been adjudicated by any court 
competitors may bring legal challenges to the validity of one or more of these patents  or attempt to circumvent the patents 
there can be no assurance that company s patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology  or that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful competitive advantages to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products  or if patents are issued to the company  design around such patents 
the company does not believe that its products infringe any patents or proprietary rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that such infringements do not exist or will not occur in the future 
as is typical in the high technology industry  the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
the company investigates all such notices and responds as appropriate in  the company received a claim from another company that alleged the company s sale of a measurement system with an ellipsometer violated such party s patent and requested the company discontinue marketing such products 
the company reviewed the patent and advised such party that the company believes that there is prior art that would invalidate such patent 
the company has not been contacted again by such party 
in addition  some customers of the company received notices of infringement from technivision corporation the estate of jerome lemelson alleging that equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes their patents 
a number of these customers have notified the company that they may seek indemnification from the company for any damages and expenses resulting from this matter 
certain of the company s customers have engaged in litigation with the late mr 
lemelson involving a number of his patents and some of these cases have been settled 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is not presently determinable  there can be no assurance that the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
based on industry practice  the company believes that in most cases it could obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms  but no assurance can be given that licenses would be available or would be on acceptable terms  that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets of know how owned by the company  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the right of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by the company  which could have a material adverse effect ii on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  adverse determination in such litigation could result in the company s loss of proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could have adverse material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sole or limited sources of supply  reliance on subcontractors  complexity in manufacturing processes 
the company is relying increasingly on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of the company s systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
for example  the company relies on kensington laboratories for the robotics incorporated in the company s automated systems 
the company does not maintain any long term supply agreements with kensington laboratories or any of its suppliers 
the company has entered into an agreement with ja woollam company for the spectroscopic ellipsometer component incorporated in the company s advanced measurement systems 
the company s reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  reduced control of pricing and timely delivery of components and subassemblies and suppliers potential inability to develop technologically advanced products to support the company s growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves extremely complex process and requires long lead times  there can be no assurance that delays or shortages caused by suppliers will not occur in the future 
the company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified  if necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if the company were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  it may be required to redesign its systems  which could prevent the company from shipping its systems to its customers on a timely basis 
certain of the company s suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would restrict the company s ability to ship its products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth 
the company s business is currently experiencing a period of growth that has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on the company s personnel and resources 
the company s ability to manage future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and controls systems on a timely basis  together with maintaining effective cost controls 
to support any future growth  the company will need to hire more engineering  manufacturing  sales  marketing  support and administrative personnel  and expand customer service capabilities 
competition worldwide for the necessary personnel in the company s industry is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel or that it will be able to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion and satisfactorily support its customers and operations 
in addition  international growth will require the company to expand its direct operations worldwide and enhance its communications infrastructure 
expansion of operations to various geographic areas with different business cultures could further strain the company s management systems 
the inability of the company s management to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
information systems and the year the company s information system uses a two digit date code and  as a result  will not recognize the difference between the years and ii the company has been informed by the vendor of the software that an upgrade is available which will appropriately recognize year date information 
the company plans to license this upgrade and implement it by management believes that the cost for the license and the related internal and external costs to implement the upgrade will not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or cash flows 
many of the company s products incorporate systems which utilize personal computers and related software to control certain functionality 
the company believes that its current products  which all use current versions of personal computer operating systems and software are compliant with the year the company is currently assessing the extent to which its older products may incorporate software which is not year compliant and  based on the results of that assessment  will determine what action  if any  is necessary 
management believes that the cost of any such actions will not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or cash flows 
dependence upon key employees 
because of the specialized nature of the company s business  the company s future performance depends upon the continued service of members of the company s senior management and other key research and development and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any of such persons could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not have employment contracts with any of its employees in the united states 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon it continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel in key areas worldwide 
hiring for such personnel is highly competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract  assimilate and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the failure to recruit additional key personnel in a timely manner  or the failure to retain new or current personnel  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of industry consolidation 
the company believes that the thin film measurement system market is undergoing a period of consolidation which could impact the company s future success 
a number of suppliers have been acquired by larger equipment manufacturers 
for example  kla corporation recently acquired a competitor of the company  tencor corporation  to form kla tencor corporation 
the company believes that similar acquisitions and business combinations involving competitors and potential competitors of the company may occur in the future 
such acquisitions could adversely impact the company s competitive position by enabling the company s competitors and potential competitors to expand their product offerings and provide direct customer support worldwide  which could afford them an advantage in meeting customers needs  particularly with those customers that seek to consolidate their capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
the greater resources  including financial  marketing and support resources  of competitors engaged in these acquisitions could permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
accordingly  such business combinations and acquisitions by competitors and potential competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has in the past considered consolidation with other companies and could consider such consolidations in the future in order to enhance the company s competitive position or respond to competitive pressures
