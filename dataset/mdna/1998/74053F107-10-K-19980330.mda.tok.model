item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  presented elsewhere in this report under item financial condition the following table compares the changes in major categories of the company s balance sheet from december  to december  dollars in thousands change vs 
amount cash cash equivalents   securities    loans    allowance for loan losses   premises equipment   other    total assets    deposits non interest bearing    interest bearing    total deposits    other interest bearing liabilities   other liabilities    total liabilities    stockholders equity    total liabilities    stockholders equity financial condition december  compared to december  total assets in grew by million from year end or 
the company focused its efforts  during  on the quality of its core net interest margin 
as a result of this focus  efforts were expended on growing the loan portfolio and consolidating customer relationships without increasing average funding cost 
accordingly  increases in noninterest bearing deposits of million  increases in interest bearing deposits of million  and capital retentions of million funded increased loans of million  and increased security holdings of million  while cash and cash equivalents remained relatively unchanged 
of the increase in loans  commercial mortgage loans increased by million or  commercial and industrial loans increased million or  and consumer loans primarily indirect automobile financing increased by million or 
these increases were the result of the business plan of the company to increase its lending in those sectors 
the increases were partially offset by decreases in residential mortgages and construction loans held by the bank of million or 
it should be noted that although residential mortgages held by the bank declined  new originations of such loans of million were sold into the secondary market reflecting the company s interest rate risk management policy 
securities increased by million  as the company actively positioned its portfolio during as a result  us treasury and us government agency securities declined million or 
however  municipal holdings increased by million or 
this shift was made principally by investing in local issue bank qualified bonds  where the tax equivalent yields are significantly higher and market price volatility value risks lower than other securities of comparable maturity 
corporate securities also increased by million or principally in floating rate instruments 
deposits increased by million 
of this amount  noninterest bearing deposits increased by million and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
of the increase in interest bearing deposits  million of growth in certificates of deposits primarily short term municipal certificates was offset by small declines in savings accounts of million and in now and money market deposit accounts of million 
for additional information regarding deposits  see item business deposits 
additionally  investments in premises and equipment declined by 
million as depreciation of million outpaced additions of million 
other assets increased million  primarily due to higher levels of interest income receivable and prepaid income tax 
the allowance for loan losses grew by 
million to million or a increase  as provisions for loan losses of million exceeded net charge offs of million 
the allowance for loan losses represented of total loans for compared to in further  the allowance for loan losses was of nonperforming loans at december  compared to at december   as nonperforming loans declined from million at year end to million at year end stockholders equity grew million or in compared to year end of this increase  million arose from net income and million from the sale of additional shares of stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and employee stock option plans and 
million from the net change in the unrealized gains on securities available for sale  after tax 
these sources were offset by dividends declared of million and treasury stock repurchases of million 
in september  the board of directors declared a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend  payable in october as a result  million of additional paid in capital was capitalized into common stock 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers who need to draw funds under their available credit facilities 
as detailed in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows included in the financial statements  cash flows are derived from three sources cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in investing activities primarily purchases and sales of securities and the funding of loans used million in as purchases of securities and net new loans of million exceeded sales  maturities  and prepayment of loans and securities 
financing activities provided million represented by million increase in deposits  and the proceeds of new common stock issuances of million  offset by dividends of million and stock repurchases and redemptions of million 
the overall result was that cash and cash equivalents remained relatively unchanged at million at december  the company s liquidity ratio defined as cash and cash equivalents plus securities available for sale million to total assets was at year end the average life of the available for sale portfolio  on a rate sensitivity basis  is approximately years 
these liquid assets  together with maturing loans  are deemed by management to be more than adequate to meet expected liquidity needs 
in addition  the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank and has the ability to borrow substantial funds million under its secured advance program 
in august  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program and authorized management to repurchase up to  shares of the company s stock from the market 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized a second repurchase program for management to repurchase an additional  shares of the company s stock 
the purpose of these repurchase programs is to offset the effects of new stock issuances under the company s dividend reinvestment and stock option plans 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares as adjusted for the stock dividends declared december and december of the company s stock 
commencing in december  the company began re issuing treasury stock to directly fund stock option exercises and dividend reinvestment plan purchases 
since that time  the company has re issued  of its treasury stock purchases for these purposes 
as a result of the pending merger with progressive bank  inc see item business pending merger 
the board of directors of the company rescinded its authorization to repurchase its common shares in the open market  in december the holding company s own liquidity needs are chiefly for paying dividends 
the principal source of income for the company is dividends and rents received from the bank 
dividends from the bank are subject to certain regulatory limitations 
the company has ample cash and liquid investments at the holding company level to meet its reasonably anticipated cash needs in financial institutions assets are monetary in nature and are thus impacted by inflation  interest rate and credit considerations 
this results in the need to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to regulatory requirements to maintain minimum capital levels 
these capital requirements and the actual levels maintained by the bank and the company are summarized in note o to the consolidated financial statements  included herein under item the capital levels of both the bank and the company exceed all regulatory requirements and regulatory agencies have informed management that  as of december   both the company and the bank qualify for well capitalized status under appropriate regulatory definitions 
further  the company believes that the capital levels maintained are more than adequate to meet its currently foreseeable needs and that additional capital resources would be required only for exceptional investment opportunities 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the bank s regulator developed risk based capital standards that take account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  the risk of nontraditional activities and the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family mortgages 
such standards may have the effect of increasing the level of regulatory capital that the company and bank are required to maintain 
the company s risk based capital ratio as of december  was compared to the minimum required for well capitalized institutions 
the company continues to seek profitable opportunities for growth in its markets and  in this regard the company has received approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency comptroller to establish two new branches in middletown  orange county  and wappingers falls  dutchess county  new york  respectively 
the success of these new offices will be dependent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond management s control  including the state of the local and national economy  customer demand and competitive conditions 
impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
although the company s principal operating software is supplied by a nationally recognized vendor  the company has determined that the vendor will be required to modify or replace significant portions of their software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company also has several pc based software systems which will require modification or replacement 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be successfully mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test all software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project not later than december  the total cost of the year project  which is not anticipated to exceed  is being funded through operating cash flows  and will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  except in the case of the purchase of any new software required  which will be capitalized 
the total resources required is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
in connection with the company s announced plan of merger with progressive bank  inc progressive  if approved by shareholders and applicable regulatory authorities  the company has decided that it will outsource its deposit  loan and general ledger processing to the provider currently used by progressive 
management has investigated the current plans of progressive and believes that the progressive plan for assessment  remediation and testing is also in the proper stage to be year compliant by year end the estimated resources required of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors in respect of both the company and its suppliers that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this field  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  testing complications and similar uncertainties 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and capital resources 
the company s investment committee of the board operating through its treasury division controls the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet while maintaining an appropriate level of net interest income contribution to the operations of the company 
the company s net interest revenue is affected by fluctuations in market interest rates as a result of timing differences in the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
these repricing differences are quantified in specific time intervals and are referred to as interest rate sensitivity gaps 
the company manages the interest rate risk of current and future earnings to a level that is consistent with its mix of businesses and seeks to limit such risk exposure to appropriate percentages of both earnings and the value of stockholders equity 
the objective in managing interest rate risk is to support the achievement of business strategies  while controlling earnings variability and ensuring appropriate liquidity 
further  the historical level of demand deposits approximately of total assets serves to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates and reduces the average cost of total liabilities 
the following chart in thousands provides a quantification of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap as of december   based upon the known repricing dates of certain assets and liabilities and the assumed repricing dates of others 
as shown in the chart below  at december   assuming no management action  the company s near term interest rate risk within three months of earning assets and within twelve months of earning assets is to a rising rate environment  that is  net interest revenue would be expected to be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates above the rates embedded in the current yield curve 
this is principally due to the higher level of liabilities that will reprice relative to similarly situated assets in that time frame 
the company s long term exposure greater than one year is to a declining rate environment as the company has an aggregate million more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities 
this chart displays only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap and does not capture the dynamics of rate and spread movements nor management s actions that may be taken to manage this risk 
maturity repricing date three months four months to total within one year to five greater than total or less one year one year years five years securities       fed funds    fixed rate loans       floating rate loans      total interest       earning assets other interest bearing deposits     time other      total interest      bearing liabilities interest sensitivity       gap gap as a percent of earning assets notes to chart interest rate sensitivity gaps are defined as the fixed rate positions assets less liabilities for a given time period 
the gaps measure the time weighted dollar equivalent volume of positions fixed for a particular period 
the gap positions reflect a repricing date at which date funds are assumed to mature and reprice to a current market rate for the asset or liability 
the table does not include loans in nonaccrual status or net unrealized gains recorded on available for sale securities as of december variable rate balances are reported based on their repricing formulas 
fixed rate balances are reported based on their scheduled contractual maturity dates  except for certain investment securities and loans secured by family residential properties that are based on anticipated cash flows 
prime priced loans and investments are considered as to month assets 
savings accounts one half of the level of merit savings accounts  which reprice against changes in the federal reserve discount rate  are classified as three months or less maturities 
managements analysis of changes in levels indicate that changes in this rate are approximately half as often as changes in other market rates 
the balance of these accounts and other savings accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities  reflecting the lagging period that historically exists in rates paid on passbook and savings accounts 
other deposits time deposits are classified by contractual maturity or repricing frequency 
now accounts are classified as four months to one year maturities 
the balance of deposits are considered less than three month maturities  including all money market deposit accounts 
the interest rate sensitivity assumptions presented for these deposits are based on historical and current experiences regarding balance retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
non interest bearing deposit liabilities were approximately million at december  interest rate risk management of interest rate risk focuses on both tactical one year or less and structural beyond one year time frames 
the company has established interest rate risk limits based on an earnings at risk ear concept and a market value of portfolio s equity mvpe 
ear measures the potential adverse impact on earnings from a given change in the yield curve  while the market value of portfolio equity risk limit is set in terms of changes in the economic present value of future cash flow streams 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on ear and mvpe under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
model parameters are determined based on past interest rate movements and are periodically updated 
ear is calculated by multiplying the gap between asset and liability maturities repricings by given changes in the yield curve 
mvpe is calculated by subtracting the net present value of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities from the net present value of interest earning assets using the same yield curve model 
both mvpe and ear are measured assuming a parallel change in market interest rates up basis points and down basis points over a one year shock 
since interest bearing non maturity deposit liabilities money market  now and savings deposits are reflected in the model by assumed repricing date 
vs 
a decay factor which would extend the life of such liabilities beyond one year 
the present value effect of such liabilities is not calculated over an expected life of the liabilities  and  therefore  the core deposit intangible value of such deposit liabilities has been eliminated from the mvpe 
such core deposit value would tend to minimize the level of actual mvpe changes as the value of core deposits rise in increasing interest rate environments and declines in decreasing rate environments 
while the company principally utilizes the parallel rate shift model for monitoring its compliance with its interest rate risk limits  it also periodically reviews and assesses its rate risk exposure to non parallel yield curve changes including inversion 
compliance with established limits is monitored by the investment committee and the company s interest rate risk profile is presented quarterly to the board of directors 
both mvpe and ear assess the company s interest rate risk based on the company s current asset and liability mix 
such limits are a maximum change in mvpe and not greater than a million change in ear over a basis points up or down of parallel shift in the yield curve 
the following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity market value of assets  less liabilities 
the interest rate scenarios presented in the table are based on interest rates at december  adjusted by instantaneous parallel rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the net interest income variability reflects the company s negative interest rate sensitivity gap defined foregoing 
the market value of portfolio equity is significantly impacted by the estimated effect of prepayments on the value of loans  and amortizing investment securities 
further  this analysis is based on the company s present profile of assets  liabilities and equity and does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
this action could minimize the decrease in market value of portfolio equity in the upward rate scenarios in thousands 
change in net interest market value of interest rates income ear portfolio equity mvpe change mvpe mortgage backed and sba securities of us government agencies the company currently invests in mortgage backed securities fhlmc  fnma  and gnma and sba pooled loans in connection with its asset liability management strategy 
as of december   the company had million in fixed rate securities and million in adjustable rate securities of this nature 
these securities are all guaranteed by us government agencies and are  therefore  of the highest investment grade 
these securities are subject to varying monthly payments due to varying prepayments by the borrowers on the underlying loans 
as a general rule  when interest rates rise  prepayments slow down  extending the anticipated maturities of the fixed rate securities 
conversely  when interest rates decline  prepayments rise  as many of the borrowers refinance their loans at lower rate levels 
the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of prepayments in securities or other earning assets with comparable yields  which can adversely affect net interest income 
prepayment levels affect the contractual repayment profile of the securities 
these uncertainties cause more volatile market value shifts than do serial or single payment bonds  particularly as interest rates rise 
the company manages this portion of its investment portfolio by only investing in such fixed rate securities with expected average lives of years but not greater than years  or in adjustable rate securities which evidence lower price volatility due to the adjustable rate feature 
the company has no holdings of high risk securities as defined by the federal financial institutions examination council 
results of operations the table below sets forth the major components of net income for each of the three years ended december   and net income increased

the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income dividend by average earning assets has continued to improve over the period from in to in and in as the company continued its efforts to improve the quality of its core net interest income

 net interest income was positively impacted by million due to changes in volumes 
the primary components of this increase were increases in average outstanding securities and loans partially offset by increases in average time deposit balances

million reflecting new business generated at slightly lower yields than the portfolio earned in in vs 
 net interest income was positively impacted by million  due to changes in volume  as the impact of increases in average earning assets  primarily in average loans and securities offset the impact of increasing savings account balances 
net interest income also was also positively impacted 
million in due to changes in interest rates 
of this amount  average loan interest declined 
million reflecting new business generated at lower yields than the portfolio earned in as well as decreases in the prime rate that took place throughout and early  as well as decreases of 
million in interest on taxable securities 
such decreases in asset yields were mirrored by decreases in deposit costs as the company aggressively managed down interest costs in in view of the general decline in market rates that occurred between and early by restructuring the interest indexing mechanism of its merit product and the run off of its higher rate month cd promotion launched in asset quality and provisions for loan losses the following table presents details of the company s nonperforming assets and restructured loans 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to interest or principal or  with respect to current loans  if management has doubts about the ability of the borrower to regularly pay interest and or principal on a timely basis 
when interest accruals are discontinued  any interest income credited to the current year which has not been collected is reversed  and any interest accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest 
if payments on nonaccrual loans are made  income is recorded when received unless management has reason to doubt the ultimate collectibility of the principal remaining on the loan 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions 
the table below summarizes the company s nonperforming assets and restructured loans for the years indicated in thousands years ended december  nonaccrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more restructured loans and troubled debt total nonperforming loans      amount collateralized by real estate      other real estate owned    total non performing assets      nonaccrual status denotes loans on which  in the opinion of management  the collection of interest or principal is unlikely  or loans that meet other nonaccrual criteria as established by regulatory authorities 
payments received on loans classified as nonaccrual are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan 
includes loans and mortgages secured by residential real estate of     and  at december      and  respectively 
nonperforming loans decreased by million to million at december  as the result of aggressive management within the portfolio which included  dn large part  management requiring borrowers to dispose of property and or refinance their credit elsewhere 
of the amount outstanding at december   million is collateralized by real estate approximately 
at december   the company had million in nonperforming loans of which million was collateralized by real estate compared to december  total nonperforming loans of million being collateralized by real estate 
other real estate owned oreo comprised ten properties at december  of which five were commercial office buildings  three were residences and two were small parcels of vacant land 
during the year  the company s net disposal of oreo properties was 
million 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk and impaired loans  see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements  under item contained herein

the provision for loan losses  which is charged to operations  is based on both the amount of net loan losses incurred and management s ongoing evaluation of the level and composition of risk in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation considers  in addition to the results of a continuous program of individual loan assessment  factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions and recent trends  loan portfolio composition  the level of nonperforming assets  prior loan loss experience and trends  growth of the portfolio and management s statistical estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company has not been involved in any foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions  which are generally considered high risk loans

net charge offs of loans were million in as compared to million in and million in management believes that economic conditions in its local marketplace have stabilized over the past two years  and is cautiously optimistic about future growth 
unemployment in all four counties in which the company operates is below  and recently ibm announced plans to invest approximately million to develop its new chip at its east fishkill plant 
ibm also completed the sale of its kingston facility closed several years ago  while stewart international airport in newburgh is undergoing a major expansion at its terminal facilities 
with these positive developments  the local economy s performance has begun to rebound and now compares more favorably with the broader us economy 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover credit risk inherent in the portfolio but no assurance can be given that the current apparent stabilization of the local economy will not be unsettled by future events 
such developments would be expected to adversely affect the financial performance of the company 
noninterest income the following table details the components of noninterest income for the years ended december dollars in thousands net change net change amount percent amount percent income from fiduciary activities service charge income    net realized gains on securities net gains on sales of loans other    total     noninterest income decreased 
million in compared to primarily due to a one time gain recorded in from the sale of the company s merchant portfolio of 
million and a service charge income decrease of 
million as the company continued to pursue its policy of increasing average account balance 
such increased average balances result in lower service charges but higher levels of interest income 
such declines in service charge income were partially offset by a 
million increase in income from fiduciary activities trust fees and a 
million increase in net gains on sales of securities and loans 
noninterest income increased million in compared to  primarily due to an increase in service charge income of 
million and the sale of the company s merchant processing services in which the company recorded a one time gain of 
million 
gains on sales of loans declined by 
million approximately 
million relates to the one time sale in of some million in previously originated mortgages into the secondary market 
underlying gains on sales of loans  therefore  actually increased by 
million 
noninterest expense the following chart outlines the major changes in noninterest expense for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in thousands years ended december  net change net change amount percent amount percent salaries benefits    occupancy    equipment oreo merger related fdic other    total    salaries and benefits expense increased in by 
million primarily due to the staffing increases 
million in late for the new orange county branches branches full year of operation in and the restructuring of the company s commercial lending division  new hires and normal salary increases 
these increases were partially offset by a change in the amount recorded related to stock appreciation rights 
in officers who had stock appreciation rights in tandem with stock options waived such appreciation rights but retained the rights to the related underlying options 
as such  the company recorded a recovery of 
million in previous expense vs 
a charge in of 
million 
salaries and benefits expense increased in by 
million compared to due to the 
million charge in connection with stock appreciation rights 

million in the fourth quarter of for the new anticipated orange county branches 

million increase in pension and profit sharing expense and the remainder due to general salary increases received by employees during the year 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased by less than 
million in vs 
primarily due to the expense of the new orange county branches in  somewhat offset by the effects of a milder winter than that experienced in and the closure of the amenia satellite branch in january occupancy and equipment expense increased in vs 
primarily due to the severe winter experienced in the first quarter of  higher levels of equipment expense and a 
million charge in connection with the closure of the amenia satellite branch 
other real estate owned expense was 
million in compared to 
million in in  the company recorded net recoveries on dispositions of oreo properties of some 
million compared to a recovery in of 
million 
exclusive of these large items  oreo expense principally relates to the levels of properties carried during the year 
oreo writedowns and provisions were 
million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
writedowns of properties after foreclosure reflect the continuing difficulty of maintaining distressed real estate values in the company s marketplace 
merger related expenses of 
million in relate to the pending merger with progressive bancorp  inc merger related expenses amounted to 
million in in connection with its prior merger for finalizing the conversion of the company s data processing system 
fdic insurance expense decreased in by 
million to 
million from levels as a result of decreases in the rate of insurance premiums to the bank insurance fund bif 
however  the bank has approximately million in deposits insured by the savings association insurance fund saif of the fdic oakar deposits  for which it was required to continue to pay into the saif fund 
on september   legislation was passed to recapitalize the saif
