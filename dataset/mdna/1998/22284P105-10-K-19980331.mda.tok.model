item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the three year period ended december   the company increased its revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of  as revenue increased to million in from million in a significant increase in fleet size to meet customer demand as well as an increase in the freight rates contributed to revenue growth over this period 
in addition to internal growth  the company completed four acquisitions during the three years ended in in  the company purchased certain assets of two small truckload carriers based in dalton  georgia 
the two carriers together generated less than million in revenue  but each provided the company with significant customer relationships 
in august  the company acquired the customer relationships of trans roads  inc  a million annual revenue dry van carrier based near atlanta  georgia 
in october  the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock of bud meyer truck lines  inc  a million annual revenue temperature controlled carrier based in lake city  minnesota 
the company intends to continue to grow both internally and through acquisitions  with the main constraint on internal growth being the ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers 
the company s improved net income approximately  to million in from million in several factors contributed to the improvement  including declining fuel prices and negotiating higher freight rates from substantially all customers 
although higher driver compensation partially offset the increased freight rates  management believes the company benefitted from attracting and retaining more drivers 
changes in several operating statistics and expense categories are expected to result from actions taken in bud meyer truck lines operates predominantly single driver tractors  as opposed to the primarily team driver tractor fleet operated by covenant s long haul  dry van operation 
the single driver fleet operates fewer miles per tractor and experiences more empty miles 
in addition  bud meyer s operations must bear additional expenses of fuel for refrigeration units  pallets  and depreciation and interest expense of more expensive trailers associated with temperature controlled service 
the additional expenses and lower productive miles are offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver 
the company s operating statistics and expenses are expected to shift in future periods with the mix of single  team  and temperature controlled operations 
the company also initiated the use of owner operators of tractors in and contracted with approximately owner operators at december  owner operators provide a tractor and driver and bear all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed lease payment per mile 
the company does not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
in  the company also financed approximately tractors under operating leases 
the lease payments to owner operators and the financing of tractors under operating leases appear as operating expenses under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for owner operator tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from owner operators and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  the company intends to evaluate its efficiency using pretax margin and net margin rather than operating ratio

the primary use of funds was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire additional revenue equipment as the company expanded its operations 
in addition  in  the company used million of such amount to consummate the acquisition of trans road  inc and bud meyer truck lines  inc 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment  net of trade ins  to be approximately million in net cash used in financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities were million in and million in the cash provided by financing activities in   and related primarily to borrowings under the credit agreement 
at december   the company had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million drawn under the credit agreement and the million in year senior notes 
interest rates on this debt range from to 
the credit agreement is with a group of banks and has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of the net book value of revenue equipment or million 
working capital borrowings are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all assets of the company if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee of per annum is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by covenant transport  inc a nevada corporation  intellectual property co  a nevada corporation  bud meyer truck lines  inc  a minnesota corporation  and covenant acquisition co  a nevada corporation 
the credit agreement revolves for two years and then has a four year term out if not renewed 
payments for interest are due quarterly in arrears with principal payments due in equal quarterly installments beginning on the second anniversary of the date of the credit agreement or any renewal 
the company renewed the loan in december and anticipates renewing the credit agreement on an annual basis 
borrowings under the credit agreement may be based on the banks base rate or libor and accrue interest based on one  two  or three month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage and a defined debt to capitalization ratio 
at december   the margin was 
in october  the company placed million in year senior notes with an insurance company 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually  and mature on october  principal payments are due in equal annual installments beginning in the seventh year of the notes 
proceeds of the notes were used to reduce borrowings under the credit agreement 
in december  the company engaged in a sale and leaseback transaction involving of the company s tractors that had been newly acquired or were awaiting delivery 
the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce debt under the credit agreement 
the company entered into a three year lease of the equipment  with a implied interest rate and a residual value guaranteed by the company at a level equal to the company s salvage value on owned tractors 
the company s headquarters facility was completed in december the cost of the approximately acres and construction of the headquarters and shop buildings was approximately million 
the company financed the land and improvements under a build to suit operating lease 
the credit agreement  senior notes  and headquarters and terminal lease agreement contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
all of these instruments are cross defaulted 
the company was in compliance with the agreements at december  inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could have an adverse effect on profitability 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for covenant than many other carriers because of covenant s long average length of haul 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
at december   approximately of the total annual purchases of fuel by the company was subject to hedging contracts 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year because of the weather 
the company s equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and the company s ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by the company s dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting the company s equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and the company believes that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of its business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the company is aware of the current concerns throughout the business community of reliance upon computer systems that do not properly recognize the year in date formats  often referred to as the year problem 
computer operations are a significant function within the company and daily operations of the company depend on the successful operation of its computer systems 
as a result the company is currently assessing year preparedness and developing a plan to help ensure continuity of operations 
the company relies upon software purchased from third party vendors rather than internally generated software 
in its analysis of the software  and based upon its ongoing discussions with vendors  the company has determined that most of its software already reflects changes necessary to avoid the year problem 
the company intends to continue to work and complete testing to ensure existing systems are year compliant and does not expect a materially adverse impact on its financial condition or operations

earnings per share 
effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share 
the standard replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps and replaces the presentation of fully diluted eps with diluted eps

diluted income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and assumed conversions of dilutive securities outstanding during the respective periods 
dilutive securities represented by options have been included in the computation 
the company uses the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive effect of options

in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment  however if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there was in  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees or curtail the company s growth 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  railroads  rail intermodal service  and to some extent with air freight service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth since june has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of the company s growth strategy 
management must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions or the company s growth could suffer
