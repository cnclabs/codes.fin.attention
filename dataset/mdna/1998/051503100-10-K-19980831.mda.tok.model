warranties the company provides up to a three year parts and labor warranty against defects in materials or workmanship on all of its products 
servicing and repairs are conducted at the company s manufacturing facilities in minneapolis and south korea 
the company s warranty expenses have not been significant 
patents the company holds four patents  three of which it no longer considers significant 
the fourth patent  acquired in december  covers high density power conversion technology high density patent which will enable the company to offer external switching power supplies less than one half the size of current power supply products but with comparable power outputs 
the high density patent was issued by the united states patent office in and the original applicant did not pursue patent protection in foreign countries 
since the high density patent was issued prior to its being assigned to the company  the company is precluded from seeking patent protection in most foreign countries 
for that reason  some of its competitions may use this type of technology for products manufactured and sold outside the united states 
also there can be no assurance that the scope of the high density patent will prevent competitors  many of whom have greater financial and other resources  from introducing competitive products or from challenging the validity of the high density patent 
seasonality as indicated by item b supplemental financial information  net sales of the company have reflected a certain degree of seasonality 
the company s first quarter falls during the summer months and during the first quarter of fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded the lowest level of sales followed by increased sales in successive quarters 
the company attributes this seasonality to the buying patterns of its customers  the timing of industry trade shows where new products are introduced and to other factors

the electronic equipment market is characterized by rapidly changing technology and shorter product life cycles 
the company s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop new products that keep pace with technological developments and respond to changes in customer requirements 
any failure by the company to respond adequately to technological changes and customer requirements or any significant delay in new product introductions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products to be developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
see business design engineering and product development 
dependence on outside contractors 
the company currently depends on third parties located in foreign countries for a significant portion of the manufacture and assembly of certain of its products 
some of these countries are economically troubled areas 
the company s reliance on such outside contractors reduces its control over quality and delivery schedules 
while the company takes an active role in overseeing quality control with its third party manufacturers  the failure by one or more of these subcontractors to deliver quality products or to deliver products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  the company s third party manufacturing arrangements are short term in nature and could be terminated with little or no notice 
if this happened  the company would be compelled to seek alternative sources to manufacture certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that any such attempts by the company would result in suitable arrangements with new third party manufacturers 
see manufacturing and sources supply 
dependence on key personnel  management of growth 
the company s success depends in part upon the continued services of many of its highly skilled personnel involved in management  engineering and sales  and upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified employees 
the loss of service of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not have key person life insurance on any its employees 
in addition  the company s future success will depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage growth successfully and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively utilize the team approach to manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
anti takeover considerations 
certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval under the company s right plan may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or merger of the company 
these provisions could delay  discourage  hinder or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of the company  could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any such attempt and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
see note stockholders equity under notes to consolidated financial statements 
year interruptions 
the company utilizes several microchip based date referenced systems for its business operations  including the timely procurement of material and supporting customer requirements 
because these business matters are also dependent on support from external sources  the company cannot provide any assurance that its ability to provide service to customers will not be interrupted by the inability of any supporting microchip based date referenced system to timely process data 
this situation could have an adverse material effect on the company s ability to retain customers and to generate revenue and profitability

all other revenues were derived from domestic sales principally in the us for other financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales including the amount of export sales for the last years  refer to note  operations information  under notes to consolidated financial statements

for such forward looking statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of shareholders and the investing public should understand that such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause results or developments to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the overall level of sales by oems in the telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and the medical markets  buying patterns of the company s existing and prospective customers  the impact of new products introduced by competitors  delays in new product introductions  higher than expected expense related to sales and new marketing initiatives  availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and components  and other risks affecting the company s target markets generally results of operations net sales for fiscal were  up from net sales of  in fiscal which were up by from net sales of  in fiscal the company achieved only modest improvement in its fiscal net sales principally because infrastructure  such as transmission stations and wired systems were not sufficiently in place to support anticipated demand for cable modems  an emerging new technology product 
because of this situation  significant orders that were expected from customers who are leading oems in this market did not materialize 
the company believes that the infrastructure issue is being addressed and  as a result  anticipates increased demand for cable modems in fiscal if this happens  the company believes that orders for its products in support of the cable modem industry could improve significantly in fiscal  thereby enhancing growth in revenue  principally in the later quarters of the fiscal year 
the telecommunications data communications market  of which the market for cable modems is a segment  is a principal user of the company s products 
other segments of the telecommunications data communications market and other markets served by the company experienced normal growth rates in fiscal and are expected to do so in fiscal driven by its successful customer service strategies  the company s sales grew in fiscal due to growth in the data communications and telecommunications market and its resulting demand for power conversion products and related services 
service to customers continues as a strong strategic focus 
to this end  the company s engineering activities are directed to various customer product applications that are anticipated to generate revenue in fiscal these applications include uninterruptible power supplies  as well as power supplies for asymmetric digital subscriber line modems a competing technology to cable modem  medical product applications  and hubs  routers and switches for the networking market 
like the cable modem market  these programs are anticipated to generate sales for the company mainly in the later quarters of fiscal the company s order backlog at may  totaled  up from  at june   which was down from  at june  the order backlog at may   represented shipments for approximately four months and reflected the posture of many oems to limit their contractual commitments to the best lead times of their customers 
aided by the order backlog at may   management believes that sales for the first quarter of fiscal will compare favorably with sales that were attained in the comparable quarter of fiscal gross profit for fiscal amounted to  or of net sales  compared to  which was of net sales for fiscal  and  which amounted to of net sales in fiscal the relatively stable rates of gross profit for fiscal and fiscal are due mainly to better prices on sales of switching power supplies and battery chargers compared to sales of other products 
compared to fiscal  the greater gross margin posted by the company in fiscal was also due to better margins on switching power supplies and the efficiencies of scale supporting the larger amounts of sales in fiscal operating expenses for fiscal totaled  which amounted to of net sales  compared to  for fiscal  which were of net sales 
in fiscal  operating expenses were  which were also of net sales 
compared to fiscal  the increased expenditure of  in fiscal was incurred principally for payments made to certify the reliability of new products and for expenditure relating to the implementation of strategic initiatives  some of which began during the second half of fiscal the strategic initiatives were implemented for the following purposes strengthening the company s sales and marketing competitive position in the us and asia 
enhancing asian manufacturing supervision providing promotional material for the company s products providing direct internet communication links between ault us and ault korea installing software for upgrading the quality of management information services 
it is anticipated that these strategic initiatives will be beneficial to the generation of future sales and the provision of information for managing the company 
compared to fiscal  the increased expenditure of  in fiscal was incurred principally for commissions paid to sales representatives on the higher sales  expenses incurred for sales promotional activities and to position the company to better compete in the asian market 
additionally  the company incurred expenses in fiscal to initiate upgrading of its management information system program  as well as for administration of its expanding foreign manufacturing activities 
also  in adherence to its policy of making performance bonus payments to its us employees for attaining certain levels of targeted profitability  payments amounting to two weeks of salaries were made to each employee in fiscal and fiscal no bonus payments were made in fiscal operating income decreased by to  from  in fiscal principally due to the expenditures that were incurred for implementation of the strategic initiatives discussed above 
operating income grew in fiscal by from  in fiscal due principally to the greater sales attained in fiscal non operating income of   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively  represented primarily interest income  currency exchange rate gains from importation of raw material by the korean subsidiary and income derived from rented portions of the korean manufacturing facility 
the company incurred interest expenses of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest expenses declined in fiscal and interest income increased due to the availability of funds that were raised from the public offering of common shares in the third quarter of the fiscal year  portions of which were used for the repayment of debt 
the company had pre tax income of  for fiscal on which its recorded income tax liability totaled  which included the utilization of deferred tax assets totaling  in fiscal  the company had pre tax income of  but derived a net tax benefit of  after the recognition of deferred tax assets amounting to  pre tax income totaled in fiscal  of which income tax expense totaled  ault korea corporation reported pre tax income of  in fiscal on which it recorded korean income tax liability of  the subsidiary incurred losses in fiscal and fiscal and had no income tax expenses

the company reported diluted per share earnings of for fiscal which was calculated from weighted average outstanding shares of liquidity and capital resources the following table describes the company s working capital resources and cash flows from operations at may   and june  may  june  working capital   resources cash   trading securities at market unutilized bank credit facilities   cash provided by used in operations  current working capital position the company s principal sources of working capital for normal growth in revenue and attainment of profit goals have been its credit facilities and cash flows from operations 
since fiscal  however  market conditions for sale of power conversion products have significantly improved at the same time that strategies of the company to grow by offering competitive engineering and services to customers were achieving increasing success 
these factors presented opportunities to enhance revenue and profits above that which its existing sources of working capital would support 
also  growth in trade receivables and inventories that resulted from increased sales and growing requirement of customers for suppliers to maintain finished products for their emergency needs were using increasing amounts of cash 
this situation placed greater reliance on credit facilities as a source of working capital 
to lessen reliance on credit facilities  the company conducted a public offering of its common shares in fiscal the proceeds from that public offering enabled the company to repay certain debt  to strengthen its operations and to commence fiscal with cash amounting to  and trading securities of  at may   the company had cash and cash equivalents and investments in trading securities totaling  up from  at june  ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to from to at june   and working capital increased during the period to  from  at june  credit facilities the company currently maintains two credit facilities  its primary credit facility with usbank  and a smaller facility with korea exchange bank that supports the south korean subsidiary 
the credit arrangement with usbank includes the following a a revolving credit facility of million at prime rate of interest  secured by trade receivables and expiring on october   although it may be amended for an extended period 
at the end of the fiscal year  there were no outstanding borrowings against it

the activities that provided  of cash were the following a net profit adjusted for non cash items provided net cash of   of which net profit before adjustments totaled  the non cash items were principally depreciation of assets which provided  of cash  and utilization of deferred tax assets which provided  of cash 
b reduction in trade receivables provided  of cash 
the reduction was principally afforded by collections in fiscal of the greater sales that were made during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to growth in receivables from sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal c reduction in inventories due to enhanced control measures and lower customer requirements for stocking of products for emergencies provided  of cash 
the activities that used  of cash were a changes in accounts payable  prepaid expenses and accrued expenses used  of cash 
the reduction occurred principally because of payment of liabilities that were incurred to support shipments for the fourth quarter of fiscal b increases in investment trading securities used  of cash

additionally  the company received an amount of  from the exercise of common stock options by employees 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the current economic crisis in south korea saw a dramatic devaluation in the won  the country s currency  late in the company s second quarter of fiscal the won has since regained some strength  but  compared to its value during the past several years  remains weak in relation to the value of the us dollar 
the effect of the translation of the korean financial statements  which were prepared in won  to us dollars  resulted in a net asset value decrease of  which related principally to long term inter company receivables as follows beginning cumulative gain at june  loss in fiscal from a 
long term inter company receivables b

although products that were manufactured by the korean subsidiary contributed a very significant portion of total sales  the devalued won had no significant impact on the company s consolidated sales for the fiscal year because the greater portions of the subsidiary s sales were made under intercompany contracts with the us operations 
sales by the subsidiary in its local market are comprised only of a small portion of its total sales in contrast to its intercompany sales 
the company s us operations have no significant exposure to currency risks because the predominant portions of its foreign contracts are made in us dollars
