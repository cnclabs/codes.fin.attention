although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following significant factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
o continued availability of suitable non proprietary computing platforms and system operating software that are compatible with the company s products 
o certain of the components for the company s products are available from limited suppliers 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if the company were unable to obtain such components in the future 
o increasing litigation with respect to the enforcement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property 
o the ability of the company to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers such as siemens ag  an intervoice distributor  which accounted for over ten percent of the company s total sales during fiscal and mci telecommunications  which accounted for over ten percent of the company s total sales during fiscal  since such customers generally are not contractually obligated to place further orders with the company 
o legislative and administrative changes and  in particular  changes affecting the telecommunications industry  such as the telecommunications act of while many industry analysts expect the telecommunications act of ultimately to result in at least a temporary surge in the procurement of telecommunications equipment and related software and other products  there is no assurance that the company can estimate with sufficient accuracy those products which will ultimately be purchased  the timing of any such purchases or the quantities to be purchased 
o risks involved in the company s international distribution and sales of its products  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights  and foreign governmental regulations that may limit or restrict the sales of call automation systems 
additionally  changes in foreign credit markets and currency exchange rates may result in requests by many international customers for extended payment terms and may have an adverse impact on the company s cash flow and its level of accounts receivable 
o the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any fiscal quarter  which can cause wide variations in the company s sales and earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
o ability of the company to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts in developing application software and otherwise tailoring its systems to customer specific requests 
o the company s ability to hire and retain  within the company s compensation parameters  qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for the services of such personnel 
o mergers and acquisitions between companies in the telecommunications and financial industries which could result in fewer companies purchasing the company s products for telecommunications and financial applications  and or delay such purchases by companies that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a merger or acquisition 
o extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market  which has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock

sales sales are derived primarily from the shipment of call automation systems to both new and existing customers in two major market categories customer premise equipment cpe and telecommunications telco 
due to customer demand  many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by vertical markets and by the geographic location of the company s existing and prospective customers 
however  the company has become more prone to quarterly sales fluctuations due to its sales to the worldwide telco market which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
effective december  the company elected to make an early adoption of the american institute of public accountants statement of position sop 
prior to the adoption of sop  the company s policy provided for the recognition of revenue upon shipment  provided that the company s remaining obligations relating to system installation and testing were not significant 
with sop  contract accounting was adopted for systems that require company customization and installation 
revenue for contracts for large systems  generally greater than  in sales value  is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue for smaller systems is recognized on the completed contract method  ie  when all the company s obligations have been met 
the requirements of sop only apply to sales which require customization and or installation by the company  and such sales have historically accounted for approximately of the company s aggregate annual sales 
as contemplated in disclosures made in the company s form q in each of the first three quarters of the company s fiscal  adoption of sop delayed by to days the company s recognition of approximately million in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of sop will result in the company not recognizing revenue in the fiscal quarter that certain systems are shipped 
however  adoption of sop will also result in the company recognizing revenue during a fiscal quarter from systems shipped in previous fiscal periods 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether the adoption of sop will result in a decrease or an increase in aggregate revenues for any future fiscal quarter 
from time to time  the company has agreed to amend customer purchase orders to extend normal payment terms in exchange for accelerating delivery and installation of systems  particularly systems not requiring customization 
the company tightened this practice in its fourth quarter of fiscal to improve cash flow 
this decision resulted in an approximate million decrease to revenues during the quarter and fiscal year 
worldwide sales in fiscal declined from the immediately preceding year  and increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
worldwide cpe sales decreased in fiscal and increased and in fiscal years and  respectively 
worldwide telco sales declined and in fiscal and  respectively  and increased in fiscal year cpe sales constituted  and of the company s total sales in fiscal years  and  respectively  while telco sales made up  and of the company s total sales during the same time periods 
sales of system maintenance contracts expanded to over  end users and comprised  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
domestic cpe sales in both fiscal and increased and in fiscal due to the company s continued investment in the expansion of its distribution channels and marketing and advertisement programs and in the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
international cpe sales in fiscal decreased  and increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
decreased international sales in fiscal resulted from a poor pacific rim economic environment and a concentration of the company s sales efforts in latin america on telecommunications opportunities 
international sales increased in fiscal and for the same reasons as the increase in domestic cpe sales 
international cpe sales constituted  and of the company s total cpe sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company believes the decline in worldwide telco sales during fiscal and was attributable to a soft domestic telecommunications market 
the company believes the market softness was attributable  in part  particularly during fiscal  to temporary delays by some telecommunications companies in implementing call automation solutions while they evaluated marketing and investment strategies in light of new opportunities resulting from deregulation under the telecommunications act of and judicial proceedings relating to certain provisions of the act 
telco sales increased in fiscal as a result of the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel and of the expansion of marketing programs 
international telco sales constituted  and of the company s total telco sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal as less than of total sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
cost of goods sold during fiscal  the company experienced an increase in cost of goods sold to of total sales from and in fiscal and  respectively 
this was the result of the company s continued investment in applications engineering and customer service resources to pursue opportunities in all of its markets despite lower than anticipated sales 
the company believes  based on anticipated sales  that in fiscal cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  will be slightly lower than in fiscal research and development fiscal  and research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal expenses included porting the company s intersoft run time software to the unix and windows nt operating systems  developing computer platform independent voice automation hardware and software  the development of the nsp platform  the development of the incontrol product line and invision and the integration of the esp product line purchased from integrated telephony products  inc into the company s incontrol product offering 
additionally  expenditures were made in fiscal  and for the ongoing development of the company s onevoice software agent platform including onevoice systems the company s call automation system  interdial the company s outbound predictive dialer system  onelink a digital interface for analog switches  development of invision  and continued development of interform a custom applications generation  or script building  user tool and digital vocalcard software and hardware functionality 
research and development expenses in fiscal and also reflect the development of computer platform independent hardware and software  a voice mail system  speech recognition in both alpha and numeric format including continuous speech  voice verification  a facsimile server  the onevoice callcenter  vertical industry application packages including applications targeted for the telecommunications industry  enhancements to the telecommunications products obtained when the company acquired voiceplex corporation  and international homologations the approvals required for connectivity to the telephone network in numerous international markets 
the company has not capitalized internal hardware or software development expenses 
the company expects that in fiscal it will maintain its strong commitment to research and development at a targeted percentage of anticipated sales slightly lower than in fiscal the company believes that this level of commitment should enable it to stay in the forefront of technology development in its business segment  which is essential to improving the company s position in the industry 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal as the company continued to hire and train new and existing sales  service and support personnel and expand its marketing and advertising programs worldwide 
the company has undertaken measures to control expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses see discussion below in income loss from operations 
accordingly  the company expects  based on anticipated sales  that in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  will be slightly less than in fiscal other income other income is primarily interest income on cash and short term investments 
the increase in other income in fiscal versus fiscal and in fiscal versus fiscal reflected the company s increased average cash balances 
income loss from operations the company incurred an operating loss and a net loss during fiscal of million and million  respectively 
the company generated operating income of million and net income of million in fiscal year during fiscal  the company generated operating income of million and net income of million 
in order to understand the company s operating and net income over the last three fiscal years  it must be noted that the company  during fiscal  incurred non recurring charges of approximately million including the following million associated with certain personnel matters  including the resignation of the company s former president and chief operating officer  million to provide for potential inventory obsolescence in the light of a migration of the company s customers to its nsp platform  million to write off certain intangible assets as a result of the company s re examination of its product development and infrastructure requirements and million to write off certain accounts receivable deemed uncollectible 
additionally  the company wrote off as in process research and development approximately million of the purchase price paid to integrated telephony products  inc for its esp product line 
also impacting operating income in fiscal was the company s adoption of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop and a tightening of the company s credit practices to improve cash flow 
see item sales 
the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation during fiscal adjusting for the one time charges and other items discussed above  the company would have generated operating income of approximately million and approximately million in fiscal and  respectively  and net income of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
adjusted operating income in fiscal and fiscal decreased and  respectively  versus the previous fiscal year as the company increased its investment in sales  marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources without a corresponding increase in the company s sales 
these investments were made to continue to pursue opportunities in the cpe and telco markets 
adjusted net income for fiscal and fiscal decreased and  respectively  versus the previous fiscal year for the same reasons as operating income decreased 
the company has undertaken measures to control expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expense control measures have begun to reduce the company s expenses and should begin to improve the ratio of expenses to sales in future fiscal periods  based on the company s anticipated sales and assuming that expense levels are not unduly influenced by unusually high one time expenses related to litigation matters  any potential mergers or acquisitions  any major research and development efforts which are not currently contemplated but which become necessary in light of market or strategic requirements  or any other future contingencies which are not currently contemplated by the company 
any anticipated increases in operating income and net income during fiscal are expected to be at a rate slightly higher than the percentage increase in anticipated sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at february   down from million at february  while the company generated positive net cash from operations of approximately million during fiscal  investment activities consisting of the acquisition and purchase of fixed assets and third party software and financing activities consisting primarily of the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock together used approximately million 
investment activities totaling approximately million during included purchasing the esp product line from integrated telephony products  inc  purchasing computing hardware and software to update the company s enterprise systems and to provide the information systems infrastructure needed to support the company s worldwide growth 
expenditures were also made to acquire third party developed software to be integrated into the company s intersoft software to allow the company to offer its customers greater functionality and to ensure the company s products comply with an increasing variety of hardware and software technologies and standards 
financing activities during fiscal included the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock  at a cost of approximately million pursuant to authorizations by its board of directors during fiscal and to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares 
the company believes that market conditions made such share repurchases of value to its shareholders 
as a result of these investment and financing activities  the company borrowed million against its million credit line from nationsbank and experienced a reduction of its cash reserves of approximately million during fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company repurchased an additional  shares of the company s stock at a cost of  the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and believes it has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive opportunities as they arise 
the company believes that its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company also believes it has access to other financial resources to pursue any investment opportunities or financing requirements that might arise in the foreseeable future 
the company is currently negotiating an extension of its million credit facility with nationsbank which is scheduled to expire on june  as with any negotiation  there is no assurance that the company and nationsbank will agree to an extension of the credit facility  however  the company believes it has access to other potential sources for credit facility financing if the facility with nationsbank is not renewed 
impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts and has no long term debt obligations  which should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects

year compliance many installed computer systems used by numerous companies to run a variety of applications are not capable of processing date sensitive information that falls beyond the twentieth century 
unless these computer systems are replaced or upgraded prior to the year to process such date sensitive information  the systems may experience severe operating difficulties or system failures 
beginning in fiscal  the company initiated a program to replace and upgrade its information systems to accommodate the company s growth  improve productivity and remediate any century compliance problems 
this program should be substantially completed before the year additionally  the company has created a year project team to review its information systems and assess and resolve any century compliance issues that are found 
the team also is attempting to ensure that any replacements and upgrades to the company s information systems are century compliant 
as a result of the program to replace and upgrade its information systems  and the efforts of the year project team  the company believes that its information systems will be century compliant prior to the year however  there is no assurance that the company will identify and resolve any and all century compliance problems with its information systems in timely manner  that the expenses associated with such remedial efforts will not be significant  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
based on a thorough review and testing of its software products and other products  the company believes that its current products are century compliant 
the company s assessment of its current products is partially dependent upon the accuracy of representations concerning century compliance made by its suppliers  such as microsoft and ibm 
many of the company s customers are  however  using earlier versions of the company s software products and other products that may not be century compliant 
the company has instituted programs to actively warn these customers of the risks associated with using software and other products which may not be century compliant  and to actively encourage such customers to migrate to the company s current products 
in addition  the company s products are generally integrated with a customer s enterprise system  which involves software products developed by other vendors 
a customer may mistakenly believe that century compliance problems with its enterprise system are attributable to products provided by the company 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on century compliance issues related to a customer s enterprise system or other products provided by third parties  custom modifications to the company s products made by third parties  or issues arising from the integration of the company s products with other products 
the company has not been a party to any proceeding involving its products or services in connection with century compliance issues  however  there is no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings against claims of century compliance issues  and any resulting liability of the company for damages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
