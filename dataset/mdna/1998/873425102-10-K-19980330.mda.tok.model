comparable stores sales for the first six months of fiscal decreased  while comparable store sales for the last six months of the year decreased only 
management attributes much of the decline during the first six months to unfavorable weather conditions  significant declines in the colorado market which was closed in november  and a promotional strategy which highlighted higher priced  premium products in an intensely price competitive landscape 
this strategy was changed during the second half of the year to a promotional strategy which continually highlights various meals at a competitive price

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management made the decision to close the seven restaurants in its colorado market 
as previously announced  the company committed substantial resources to this market during in an attempt to reverse trends of poor sales and losses 
the desired results from the implementation of the plan were not achieved and the decision to close the market was made 
these seven restaurants had total sales of approximately million and operating losses of million during the approximately eleven months of that they were in operation 
additionally  the company continued to experience unfavorable sales trends during  concluding the year with comparable restaurant sales declining 
however  during the first six months of  comparable restaurant sales declined 
this trend compelled management to continue its evaluation of the operating model of the company 
during this evaluation  management concluded that certain volumes must be achieved in order to operate individual restaurants in accordance with company standards 
these standards include food quality  cleanliness  speed of service  and profitability 
management reviewed all existing restaurants to determine which restaurants could not reasonably be expected to achieve these volume levels  generally annual revenues of at least million 
this led to the decision to close an additional ten restaurants 
due to the significance of the closures described above  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of all remaining assets as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas 
management concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant impairment of intangible as well as long lived assets was required to be recognized 
the impairment was reflective of a market value determined to be less than the carrying value of approximately restaurants  of which were acquired 
the assets were tested for impairment by projecting cash flows for individual restaurants based on recent results and trends specific to that restaurant 
the undiscounted projected cash flows for each restaurant were compared to the carrying value for that restaurant  including allocated goodwill  where applicable 
if the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value  an impairment was deemed to have occurred 
the amount of the impairment was determined by calculating the difference between the present value of the projected cash flows and the carrying value attributable to the specific restaurant 
the cash flows were discounted using the rate of return the company utilizes for approving new restaurant construction 
such discounted cash flows are  in management s opinion  the best estimate of the assets current value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future discounted cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates 
the process described above resulted in the company s recording a special charge during the fourth quarter of of million pre tax  million after tax  or per share 
this amount had the following components impairment of intangible assets of million and impairment of long lived assets of million for restaurants that will continue in operation  based on the fas analysis described above  a provision of million for the closure of seventeen restaurants  including all of the restaurants in the colorado market 
the amount was determined in accordance with fas and is comprised of million for the carrying value of the assets  net of estimated proceeds of million for the sale of restaurant properties  million to record the estimated lease related obligations for closed restaurants 
this amount was determined as the lesser of the present value of the monthly lease commitments  net of expected sublease receipts  or lease termination provisions   for severance and relocation benefits paid to employees displaced by the restaurant closures   for the probable settlement of a franchisee lawsuit related to the colorado market the write off of other assets totaling  during  the seventeen restaurants contributed a total of million in sales  and had operating losses totaling million 
in addition  the total amount of depreciation an amortization recorded during relating to assets which were impaired was approximately million 
a total of approximately  of the amounts accrued had been paid prior to december  it is currently anticipated that payments of approximately million will be made under the lease obligations during it is also anticipated that proceeds of approximately million will be realized due to the sale of closed restaurants  although there can be no assurance of the particular price at which any of such properties will be sold

impact of inflation although increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations  management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s operations to date 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s sales fluctuate seasonally 
historically  the company s highest sales and earnings occur in the second and third quarters 
in addition  quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  and the company s growth may offset the impact of seasonal influences 
therefore  quarterly results are not indicative of results for the entire year 
year issue the company relies to a large extent on computer technology to carry out its day to day operations 
many software products in the marketplace are only able to recognize a two digit year date and therefore will recognize a date using as the year instead of the year the year issue 
this problem could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the effects of the year issue upon its operations can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate year issue effects upon their own operations  products or services 
the company s total year issue project cost and estimates to complete include estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company will use both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year issue modifications 
the company plans to complete the year issue project by december  the total cost of the year issue project is estimated to be  of which the company has incurred  relating to the purchase of new software 
the costs relating to the year issue are being financed through operating cash flows and borrowings from the company s available credit facilities 
of the total project cost  the majority is attributable to the purchase of new software which will be capitalized 
the remaining amount  which will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  the costs the company has incurred and expensed relating to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year issue and the development of a remediation plan have not had a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year issue project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
specific factors that that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  and similar uncertainties
