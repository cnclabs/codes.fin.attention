fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased approximately due to a increase in revenues from north american installation and replacement services and a increase in north american repair and restoration services  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from international operations 
total revenues from north american operations were million in fiscal revenues from electric utilities  gas utilities and telephone companies constituted  and  respectively of such fiscal revenues 
revenues from electric utilities increased substantially in fiscal  primarily from the company s largest customer  florida power light 
revenues from gas utilities also increased in fiscal due primarily to expansion on service capabilities to existing customers 
in march  due to issues associated with contract pricing and mix of work  the company terminated its contracts with its largest gas utility customer  washington gas light company  which accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal accordingly  revenues from gas utilities are expected to decline in fiscal revenues from north american installation and replacement services were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased replacement services for customers under test  treat or replace contracts  particularly florida power light  accounted for most of this increase 
the company ordered new equipment to add flowmole drilling systems to its north american operations from new vendors and began to receive deliveries in september the total number of drilling systems increased from at april  to at march  the company accordingly increased substantially its capacity to perform installation and replacement services in response to increased customer demand 
the company also increased its capacity to perform traditional trenching services  but eliminated many of those crews in march due to termination of work for its largest gas utility customer 
the average price per foot charged for installation and replacement services increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the increased difficulty of work performed  primarily attributed to performing a higher percentage of installation and replacement projects in extremely hard or rocky soil conditions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concentrated most of its crews in the southeastern united states 
usually severe rains and thunderstorms in that region  attributed to el nino weather patterns  adversely affected the company s revenues in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  the company s revenues from north american installation and replacement services decreased to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal  in spite of an increase in the number of crews available to work 
the increase in revenues from north american repair and restoration services resulted primarily from the addition of crews equipped to perform repair of faulted underground electric cables for florida power light  as well as increased levels of cablecure injection services for other customers 
total cable injected in fiscal increased to million feet  compared to million feet in fiscal revenue from the company s international operations decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal lower revenues from sales of flowmole drilling systems to international customers offset higher revenues from cablecure injection services in europe 
the company had substantially sold its inventory of drilling systems at the beginning of fiscal and did not begin to receive new drilling systems from its new vendors until september the company was therefore limited in its ability to quote new systems for sale during the first two quarters of fiscal in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  sales opportunities to many customers in asia were limited by weak economic conditions 
demand for cablecure injection services increased as european utilities increased their acceptance of the cablecure technology and the company increased its marketing efforts 
gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal during the first two quarters of fiscal  gross profit decreased due primarily to investment in employees and equipment to perform new services  including repair of faulted underground electric cables  in addition to hiring and training new employees for flowmole crews in anticipation of the receipt of new drilling systems  which commenced in september also  changes in contract pricing and subsequent changes in the mix of work received from the company s largest gas utility customer produced a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
the company began to improve its gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal as new drilling equipment was placed into service  utilizing existing employees to form new crews  and the company renegotiated pricing on a number of contracts to increase gross profit 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concentrated approximately three fourths of its crews in the southeastern united states 
usually severe rains and thunderstorms in the region  attributed to el nino weather patterns  adversely affected the crews ability to work 
most of those crews accordingly lost approximately thirty percent of their available workdays 
the reduced revenues  coupled with an increased number of crews operating  substantially contributed to lower gross profit 
gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was also adversely affected by costs to terminate the company s contracts with its largest gas utility customer 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred higher than normal expenses for warranty costs  reserves for inventory obsolescence  and a writedown of inventories of parts held for sale  which further reduced gross profit by approximately  the company experienced a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue from its international operations in fiscal the company earned higher margins on the equipment sales it completed in fiscal also  cablecure services in europe typically generate higher margins than other international revenues  and the increased mix of revenue from such services contributed to the improved gross profit percentage in fiscal operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses  as the company increased its resources to pursue further growth opportunities 
in addition  the company incurred approximately  in expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the design of new enterprise wide computer software expected to be installed in the third quarter of fiscal research and engineering expenses decreased compared to fiscal lower levels of spending on the company s prototype series g drill than was incurred in fiscal was the primary cause of the decrease 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  in fiscal compared to operating income of  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal as a result of higher average usage of the company s line of credit and interest expenses on capital leases used to finance some of the company s purchases of new drilling equipment in fiscal income tax benefit 
the company reported a provision in fiscal to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
the company had no federal or state income tax provision related to united states operations in fiscal due to realizing the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company reported an  income tax benefit in fiscal due to additional refunds from prior years generated as a result of a favorable conclusion of an internal revenue service examination of its fiscal federal tax return 
also  the company recognized  in tax refunds associated with fiscal tax losses incurred by its european subsidiary 
the company did not record any income tax benefits against its pretax loss in fiscal because the company was in a loss carryforward position at the beginning of fiscal  and continues to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its deferred tax assets as of march  on an ongoing basis  the company would typically expect an effective income tax rate of approximately due to state income taxes and the impact of nondeductible expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased approximately  due to a increase in revenues from north american flowmole operations and a increase in north american cablecure revenue  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the company s international operations 
total revenues from north american operations in fiscal were million 
revenues from electric utilities  gas utilities and telephone companies constituted  and  respectively  of such fiscal revenues 
revenues from electric utilities  including cablecure revenues  increased substantially in fiscal  primarily due to growth from test  treat or replace customers 
revenues from gas utilities also increased substantially in fiscal due to expansion of the company s ability to offer traditional trenching services and full service installations  including gas pipe fusion 
flowmole revenues in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal and include both revenue from trenchless and conventional trenching methods of installation and replacement of underground utilities 
flowmole operations accounted for and of consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from flowmole operations in fiscal was primarily a result of increased demand for the company s services 
the company s test  treat or replace service option has generated significant increases in replacement work from electric utility customers who were not major flowmole customers in prior years 
in addition  the company has significantly increased its capabilities to perform gas pipe fusion and to perform installation and replacement services using conventional trenching methods 
as a result  revenues from gas utilities contributed a significant portion of the increase in flowmole revenues 
the company s average price per foot installed or replaced increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the increased complexity of work performed by the company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company did not experience the severe winter weather throughout the eastern united states that adversely affected the company s flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal consequently  flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  compared to million in the same period of fiscal as a result of the above factors  the weighted average number of fully utilized flowmole drilling systems in operation during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal cablecure revenues in north america increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the total cable injected in north america increased to over million feet in fiscal  compared to million feet in fiscal much of this increase is attributable to increased revenues from customers choosing a test  treat or replace contract 
under such a contract  the company is assigned certain spans of cable which are tested for splices or corrosion  and either injected with cablecure fluid or replaced by the company s flowmole crews 
most cable can be injected  and the company attempts to schedule the replacement portions of such work in a manner that affords maximum productivity 
revenue from the company s international operations decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal total revenues from equipment sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company substantially sold its inventory of new equipment in the first half of fiscal revenue from service operations in europe increased in fiscal  partially offsetting the decline in revenue from equipment sales 
gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues increased to of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal the fixed costs of flowmole operations are a significant component of total costs  and therefore gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved in fiscal due to higher revenue levels 
also  the company restructured its cablecure hiring and training practices in fiscal  and crews began to achieve a high level of improved productivity  measured in terms of feet injected per day  during the second quarter of fiscal  which served to increase gross profit in the second half of fiscal and in all of fiscal the company experienced an increase in gross profit percentage in its international operations in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a change in the mix of revenues 
the company generates a higher margin on international services and international spare parts sales than on sales of equipment 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal research and engineering expenses increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the company s restructuring announced on april  which allowed the elimination of a number of corporate staff positions and a million reduction in overhead expenses 
the company achieved its cost reduction objectives 
the savings were partially offset by higher royalty payments to dow corning under the company s exclusive cablecure license agreement 
due to the growth in revenues and gross profit from worldwide cablecure operations  the provisions for such royalty payments increased to approximately  in fiscal provisions for such payments amounted to approximately  in fiscal the higher research and engineering expense levels in fiscal reflect the prototype testing of the series g drill and enhanced electronics guidance systems 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported operating income of  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest income expense was income of  in fiscal  compared to an expense of  in fiscal  due to lower levels of borrowing on the company s line of credit during fiscal other income expense  net includes foreign exchange losses  resulting primarily from operations in germany  which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax benefit 
the company reported a provision in fiscal to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
the company had no federal or state income tax provision related to united states operations in fiscal due to realizing the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company reported an  income tax benefit in fiscal due to additional refunds from prior years generated as a result of a favorable conclusion of an internal revenue service examination of its fiscal federal tax return 
also  the company recognized  in tax refunds associated with fiscal tax losses incurred by its european subsidiary 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported net income of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company funded its early growth and the commercial introduction of its services through equipment sale leaseback financing  and the issuance of debt and equity securities  including the sale of common stock in an initial public offering in march since its initial public offering  the company has primarily financed its operations through cash flow from operations  cash reserves  leases and periodic usage of its line of credit 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  at march  during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately  primarily for upgrades and additions to its fleet of drilling equipment and purchases of conventional and other equipment in order to respond to its customers requests for expanded service capabilities 
the company expects to continue the periodic use of its line of credit to meet its short term financing needs  due to seasonal and other factors which impact the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company anticipates approximately million in capital and capital related expenditures in fiscal such expenditures include approximately million in remaining costs for the installation of new enterprise wide computer software and hardware  targeted for completion in the third quarter of fiscal a portion of such expenditures  including user training and data conversion costs  will be charged to general and administrative expenses in fiscal the company also has ordered flowmole drilling equipment for delivery in fiscal with an aggregate acquisition cost of million 
other equipment will be ordered during fiscal the company relies on cash flow from operations and lease financing  in addition to its line of credit  to fund operations 
the company believes that its lease facility and line of credit  together with cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet its financing needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  that such facilities will continue to be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the company s financial performance will be a key factor in determining the availability of such facilities 
if either facility became unavailable to the company  or if the company is required to seek additional capital to fund anticipated growth  the company would be required to seek other sources of public or private capital 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available to the company through such sources when needed or will be available on terms favorable to the company 
if at any time the company is unable to obtain sufficient funds  the company will be required to restrict or eliminate plans for expansion and other aspects of its operations 
at march   the company had an available bank credit facility of  and an outstanding balance on the facility of  the credit facility expires on january   however  the company expects to be able to obtain a renewal of the facility or to negotiate a similar facility with another financial institution 
review and outlook installation and replacement services 
the company currently owns equipment to field flowmole systems  and conventional trenching crews 
the company typically plans for excess equipment to allow time for preventive maintenance  matching of equipment to job types  mobilization time  or other equipment downtime factors 
the company expects to sell some new drilling systems to international customers and has flexibility to adjust delivery schedules and to quickly place new systems into service operations if demand arises 
the company also expects to acquire significant amounts of conventional trenching equipment in fiscal  but will use short term rentals to supplement its equipment needs until it chooses to acquire new or used equipment of its own 
the company currently plans to increase its personnel to add additional installation and replacement capabilities in fiscal however  the company s revenue levels  and the weighted average number of crews in operation on any given day  will be affected by various factors  including weather  pricing  competition  customer work release practices  soil and other work difficulty determinants  and permitting 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors and utilities budgetary considerations included under important risk factors regarding forward looking statements  below 
repair and restoration services 
the company expects a continuation of the trend towards increased customer acceptance of the cablecure process  including an increased level of work under test  treat or replace contracts 
the company anticipates that the trend towards lower pricing for cable replacement will continue to place downward pressure on the price for cablecure services 
see competition under part i  item i 
the company s ten largest cablecure customers account for the majority of the company s cablecure revenues 
the company expects to see increased volumes from new customers in calendar  and some increased volumes from existing customers  but expects to continue to be dependent upon a small number of customers 
the company s goal is to reduce this dependency through growth 
because the company s customers can typically cancel their work on short notice  a certain degree of uncertainty always exists in the company s future revenue levels 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors  utilities budgetary considerations and dow corning corporation included under important risk factors regarding forward looking statements  below 
international operations 
the company intends to emphasize its service businesses and continuation of its spare parts revenues in future international operations 
the company operated five drilling crews in the united kingdom in fiscal and revenues from drilling operations in the united kingdom were and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
customer orders for united kingdom drilling services are typically of very short duration  so sudden unanticipated changes in the level of competition or customer demand could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s operations 
cablecure services in europe have been concentrated in germany and austria 
the company also has current licensees operating in korea and scandinavia 
international cablecure revenue levels  primarily from german operations  were approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company is in the process of adding personnel to support expected growth in european cablecure services 
customer acceptance of the cablecure process  however  is proceeding slowly in europe  as it did in past years in the united states 
the company plans to continue expanding its sales efforts throughout europe and asia 
spare parts sales accounted for and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects to be able to maintain or increase its spare parts sales  due to the sales of additional new equipment in fiscal and any such sales in the future however  the company s sales of new drilling systems has declined in the past year due to limited inventories of new equipment available and weakness in the general economy in certain asian countries  and there can be no assurance that international customers will continue to purchase new equipment or spare parts from the company 
operating expenses 
the company plans to add resources for recruiting  training  sales and marketing  and enhanced information systems during fiscal to support the planned growth in the company s operations  and accordingly expects operating expenses to increase in fiscal the exact amount of such increases cannot be projected with certainty 
the company has determined that some of its management information systems do not accurately adjust for the year  and has commenced a project to replace its management information systems in its entirety 
the software selected is certified by the vendor to be year compliant 
the implementation of the new system is scheduled for no later than the third quarter of fiscal see also discussion of capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources  above 
the company does not anticipate any material charge to earnings associated with writing off the net book value of capitalized hardware and software costs 
the company has begun contacting its major vendors and customers to obtain their assurance that systems affecting the company are year complaint 
to date  the company is unaware of any situations of noncompliance that would adversely affect its operations 
the company has also analyzed its equipment and its operations and has not identified any processes that depend upon software that is date sensitive or otherwise subject to risks associated with the year see also discussion of capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources  above 
the company is required to pay a royalty to dow corning based on the net profits from worldwide cablecure services  as defined in the underlying exclusive license agreement 
the level of such provisions for royalty expenditures will increase from fiscal levels if the projections of improving levels of cablecure revenues are achieved 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item capital expenditures and other matters 
the company expects to continue to require substantial levels of capital spending 
in fiscal  capital spending will emphasize acquisition of new drilling systems  upgrading of existing field power units to support existing series d drills  as well as the purchase of additional conventional equipment  such as backhoes  to support customer requirements for increased turnkey capabilities 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation has had only a minimal effect on the company s revenues and expenses and is not expected to have a significant impact on revenues or expenses in fiscal other matters 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 comprehensive income fas

it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
fas supersedes fas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
fas is effective for the year ending march  and requires restatement of earlier periods presented 
the impact of adopting fas has not been determined 
the company will adopt the statement for the year ending march  important risk factors regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements on which the company relies in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements utilities budgetary considerations 
budgetary considerations  arising from unfavorable regulatory determinations on matters such as rate setting  capitalization of services performed by the company  approval of mergers and acquisitions or siting of power production facilities  or from reductions in new housing starts  reductions in electric utility revenues due to mild weather  and general economic downturns  or overall utility profitability relative to its objectives have affected the ability of some of the company s utility customers to sustain their cable replacement or other maintenance programs and accordingly adversely impact the company s revenues and profits 
although the company has broadened its customer base  one customer generates a significant portion of the company s consolidated revenues  and a small number of customers generate more than half of its cablecure revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item because cable replacement  restoration and other maintenance programs are  to a substantial extent  deferrable and the company s contracts with its utility customers permit termination of orders on relatively short notice  postponement or cancellation of such programs by customers can interject substantial volatility into the company s revenues and profits 
competition 
the company has experienced a long term trend of declining prices for guided boring services  particularly for smaller diameter utility installations  due to competitive pressures and changes in utility bidding practices 
this trend has also caused the company to lower its prices for cablecure injection services  which are priced at a discount to replacement costs  including replacement via guided boring 
in addition  the company s utility customers are increasing their requests for turnkey installation  replacement and restoration services  requiring their drilling contractors to take responsibility for switching circuits  terminating circuits  and other non incidental tasks 
these tasks require additional equipment and labor  and the cost increases can offset any price increase the company is able to negotiate for the expansion of its services 
the company s average price per foot drilled or injected in fiscal increased slightly over its fiscal results due to increased work difficulty 
the overall trend of falling prices for guided boring services is expected to continue into the future  as more customers award work based on competitive bidding  more customers require their drilling contractors to perform additional tasks as part of the drilling contract  and more conventional contractors acquire drilling capabilities in order to enter into this segment of the construction industry 
this trend will continue to put downward pressure on the market price for cablecure services 
the company cannot predict the ultimate duration or the magnitude of these decreases 
seasonal factors 
weather and other seasonal factors may decrease the company s revenues and profits in any given period 
adverse weather may preclude the company from operating its flowmole drilling systems or providing its cablecure services at certain times of the year 
such factors severely impacted the company s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company believes that the regular budgetary cycles of certain of its north american utility customers tend to concentrate demand for the company s services during the third quarter of its fiscal year the fourth quarter of the calendar year  although other budgetary factors described below may override this trend in any given quarter 
as a result of these factors  results of operations in any given fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results in any other fiscal quarter 
management of growth 
the company expects significant internal growth 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations as they expand 
any future growth will impose significant additional responsibilities on members of senior management  including the need to identify  recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
there can be no assurance that such additional management will be identified and retained by the company 
to the extent that the company is unable to manage its growth efficiently and effectively  or is unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
availability of qualified employees 
the company s ability to provide high quality services on a timely basis requires an adequate supply of skilled laborers  equipment operators  journeymen linemen and project managers 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase its productivity and profitability will be limited by its ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet the company s requirements 
many companies in the company s industry are currently experiencing shortages of qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently  that the company s labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel or that the company will not have to curtail its planned internal growth as a result of labor shortages 
dow corning corporation 
the company purchases its cablecure fluid exclusively from dow corning 
in may  dow corning filed for protection under chapter while the company has been informed by dow corning that it intends to continue the cablecure business  there can be no assurance that dow corning or the bankruptcy court will not take action to amend or terminate the cablecure license agreement 
see the discussion under the cablecure service in part i  item florida subcontract negotiations 
the company is party to an agreement the underlying agreement under which it utilizes a single florida based subcontractor for performance of certain cablecure injection tasks for florida power light through january the underlying agreement calls for the company to pay the subcontractor a percentage of the amount charged to florida power light for certain services defined in the underlying agreement 
the company agreed to new pricing in its contract with florida power light in the first quarter of fiscal the company is in a dispute with this subcontractor  over amounts to be paid to the subcontractor effective april  an interim agreement  subject to retroactive adjustments  was agreed to by the company and the subcontractor for the period april  to may  the subcontractor is continuing to perform the injection services required by the company under the underlying agreement 
the company believes that payments made to the subcontractor subsequent to april  are in conformity with the underlying agreement 
the subcontractor claims to be entitled to a percentage of additional amounts 
on october   the company filed suit against the subcontractor in florida  seeking resolution of the price dispute  among other matters 
there can be no assurance that the final price settled upon for payments to the subcontractor will not have a material adverse effect on the gross profit realized by the company under its contract with florida power light 
based on the footage injected by the subcontractor during the fiscal  management of the company does not anticipate that the final resolution of this matter will result in any material adverse impact on fiscal results of operations  or on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity  as of march  foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results are affected by fluctuations in certain foreign currencies  particularly the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the german deutschmark 
such fluctuations could result in material adverse adjustments to the carrying values of accounts receivable or other assets measured in foreign currencies  or on the reported results of operations of the company s european operations
