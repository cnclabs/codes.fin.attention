net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased for fiscal to million from million for fiscal gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase in sales relates to sales of subsidiaries acquired during fiscal the company s sales were to customers in the following geographic regions fiscal fiscal in millions in millions geographic region usa far east pacific rim middle east south america europe other the company s sales were to customers in the following industry sectors fiscal fiscal in millions in millions industry sector power refining chemical petrochemical oil and gas other sales for petrochemical and oil and gas sectors are not segregated and are included elsewhere in the above chart 
revenues in fiscal from all geographic areas increased over fiscal levels primarily due to the company s continued expansion through acquisitions 
the company s domestic market for its construction services continues to expand while sales from the company s pipe fabrication and bending operations declined in fiscal due to the substantial completion of a large mining contract in fiscal with respect to the far east pacific rim region  the company expects that sales in the foreseeable future will be negatively impacted by the economic problems in the region  although the company has not experienced any significant project cancellations  only delays in the commencement of work 
the company believes that the long term outlook for growth in sales in the south america region is positive based upon the current economic outlook  the prospective projects identified by the company and the company s existing presence and contacts in the region  particularly in venezuela  however  there are short term economic and political uncertainties that will likely negatively impact sales growth in the region in fiscal the increase in sales to europe in fiscal  compared to the prior year  is primarily due to the acquisitions of the company s united kingdom operations ped and certain of the prospect businesses in the first quarter of fiscal the company is still in process of integrating these uk operations with shaw s strategies and procedures and expects to be completed with this process during fiscal until such time  the company expects sales to europe to be negatively impacted 
gross margins for fiscal decreased to from from fiscal due primarily to the following factors i a higher volume of construction and maintenance work  which typically produces a lower gross profit margin  ii reduced gross margins on the company s manufactured products due to pricing pressure experienced in from foreign imports  and iii lower margins realized from the company s uk operations since the acquisition of ped and certain businesses of prospect 
the company expects that construction and maintenance work will continue to be a significant portion of its operations  and gross margins may be at lower than historical levels as a result 
with regard to the pricing pressures from foreign imports on its manufactured products  the company does not foresee a change in these pressures in the short term 
while the uk market has historically produced lower margins than other markets  the company is in the process of integrating these operations with the company s operating processes  which the company believes will enhance the overall profitability of the operation 
by the end of the second quarter of fiscal  the company will have terminated approximately of the uk workforce  which will result in future cost savings 
the related contractual severance costs have been included as a cost of the acquisition of the businesses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million to million  as compared to million in fiscal approximately  million of the increase relates to general and administrative expenses of newly acquired subsidiaries  including those owned for only part of fiscal the remaining increase in these expenses relates to increased costs of corporate overhead due to the increase in the company s operations 
as a percentage of sales  however  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  up from the million incurred in fiscal  primarily due to increased borrowings resulting from the expansion of business and the acquisitions of prospect  cojafex  ped and lancas in the company s effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the decrease in the fiscal rates from fiscal was primarily due to additional tax savings from higher foreign sales and foreign sourced income taxed at lower rates partially offset by lower state income tax incentives and refunds 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased for fiscal to million from million for fiscal gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal approximately million of the sales increase relates to sales of newly acquired subsidiaries  including those owned for only part of fiscal the remaining increase was due primarily to increased sales for projects in the domestic chemical and other sectors primarily mining  and the foreign power sector  offset by a decrease in the domestic refining sector

the decrease in the fiscal rates from fiscal was primarily due to state income tax incentives and refunds 
the majority of these incentives and refunds may not be recurring  however  any increase in state income taxes should be partially offset by additional tax savings from foreign sales
