item description of business telcom semiconductor  inc the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets a diversified portfolio of high performance standard analog integrated circuits for a wide variety of applications in the industrial  communications  computer  and medical markets 
the company s products comprise three principal product families power management products  such as switch mode power supply controllers  whose function is to conserve power  mixed signal products  which are analog devices with some digital control functionality  such as display analog digital converters  and smart sensors  such as solid state thermal management devices 
within each family  the company markets proprietary and selected second source products offering a range of performance  functionality and price 
telcom produces the substantial majority of its wafers at its manufacturing facility in mountain view  california 
the company believes that its in house wafer fabrication facility provides a competitive advantage because it facilitates close collaboration between design and process engineers  provides control over wafer supply  offers the potential for lower manufacturing costs and accelerates product introduction 
the company utilizes cmos  bipolar and bicmos process technologies  which are tailored to meet product specifications and customer requirements 
telcom performs final testing at  and ships its products from  its facility in hong kong 
the company was organized in delaware in june and began operations in december after purchasing the semiconductor operations of teledyne  inc teledyne which principally consisted of its teledyne components division teledyne components 
the company s principal executive offices are located at terra bella avenue  mountain view  california  and its telephone number is strategy telcom s objective is to be a leading provider of high performance analog circuits for a wide variety of applications in high growth markets 
to achieve this objective  the company has adopted the following strategies customer driven marketing and product development 
telcom seeks to identify customers that are leaders in each of the company s targeted market segments  work with these customers to understand their analog device applications and needs  and develop for these customers product solutions that offer a combination of high performance  increased functionality and cost savings 
the company believes that working with market leaders can result in early adoption of its products by such customers and maximize product sales 
in working with market leaders  the company directs its efforts toward products that have the potential to become industry standard products  since other industry participants often tend to adopt products used by market leaders 
after penetrating both market leaders and other industry participants  the company s strategy is to use its distribution network to offer the same products to potential customers with similar needs in other industries 
build product families 
telcom s current products comprise three principal product families mixed signal products  which are analog devices with some digital control functionality  such as display analog digital converters  power management products  such as switch mode power supply controls whose function is to conserve power and smart sensors  such as solid state thermal management devices that can shut off expensive microprocessor based systems when temperatures exceed a specified threshold 
the company s product strategy is to introduce new proprietary products and selected second source products within its principal product families in order to increase the range of performance and capabilities of its products and to address a broad spectrum of customer applications 
maintain technological leadership 
the company seeks to utilize its design engineers and its process expertise to produce feature rich analog circuits at competitive prices 
telcom has built a team of experienced analog design engineers who combine their industry expertise with computer aided design technology to design products to meet exacting customer requirements in a timely manner 
the company is continually developing new manufacturing technologies to enable production of the more sophisticated devices being designed by its designers 
customers and markets telcom s marketing strategy is to identify leading customers within each of its targeted market segments  work with these customers to understand their analog device applications  and develop jointly with these customers product solutions that offer a combination of high performance  increased functionality and cost savings 
an additional benefit of working with leading customers is the ability to gain insight into their next generation product requirements and to identify second source product needs that the company may be in a position to fulfill 
telcom believes that its relationships with market leaders  such as motorola in the cellular telephone market and compaq computer in the pc market  enable the company to sell such product solutions to other significant participants in such markets 
telcom also relies on its worldwide distribution network to accumulate information about other possible applications for the company s products 
as described below  the company s products are used in a broad range of applications within the industrial  communications and computer markets 
the company also develops products for the automotive and medical markets 
communications market 
the proliferation of hand held communications devices such as cellular telephones  pocket pagers and personal two way radios has created a demand for analog devices that monitor and reduce power consumption 
telcom offers a range of analog circuits to address the demands of these products for longer battery life 
these circuits include battery full low charge detection and dc dc converters for the generation of voltages to drive liquid crystal displays  including backlighting 
these devices are offered in miniature packages resulting in savings in space and weight 
the company s family of high current mosfet drivers are used with telcom s switch mode power supply controllers to regulate ac to dc power in cellular base stations  pbx and telephone and data communication equipment 
computer market 
the rapid adoption of networked pcs  workstations and servers and the deployment of machines using high performance microprocessors have given rise to the need for reliable temperature rise detection for power supply shutdown and fan speed control 
as part of its smart sensor product family  telcom has a patented solid state temperature sensor that facilitates rapid temperature rise detection that can be used for controlled shutdown of equipment with no loss of data or destruction of critical or expensive components 
this trend to protect critical components by replacing older mechanical solutions with high performance analog devices is extending into notebook computers  modular power supplies and industrial and consumer product temperature alarms 
the reliability and robust nature of silicon make analog devices preferable to mechanical devices in many respects 
telcom also makes power analog circuits for use in laptop notebook computers  palmtop computers  personal digital assistants  pocket organizers  facsimile modems and cd rom products 
these products offer low operating current and or high current drive capability for deriving additional voltages from battery or line powered equipment 
industrial market 
increased demand for precision and reliability has resulted in higher semiconductor content in industrial instruments and manufacturing equipment 
telcom offers a broad range of integrating analog to digital converters that address the measurement of dc and ac voltages and currents  resistance and capacitance 
these devices are commonly used in digital multimeters  panel meters  temperature meters  digital scales and digital oscilloscopes 
this broad line of power management circuits offer the ability to detect and regulate voltages for use in battery and line powered industrial equipment 
products the company offers a diversified portfolio of over products for a wide range of market applications to reduce its dependence on any single product  industry or application 
the company s product strategy is to introduce new proprietary products and selected second source products within its principal product families in order to increase the range of performance and capabilities of its products and to address a broad spectrum of customer applications 
power management products 
telcom is focusing a significant portion of its design resources on power management products  which comprise the company s core product area 
the primary power management circuits offered by the company are mosfet power drivers  bicmos switch mode power supply controllers  dc dc converters and cmos voltage detectors including microprocessor supervisory circuits 
telcom is also developing very low quiescent current dc dc switching regulators and voltage detectors  and is modifying its existing bipolar process to allow it to address the higher current and voltage marketplace 
the company already has a broad line of cmos drivers and has plans to increase products within this family 
the company s power management product family also includes low quiescent current cmos ldo low drop out regulators offering dropout voltages minimum voltage needed across the device to maintain output voltage regulation of milli volts to maximize the time before the battery is exhausted 
the company pioneered the introduction of a cmos version of a pervasive bipolar pwm pulse width modulator circuit for power supply applications 
this low power alternative to the bipolar competition addresses high end market applications  such as telephone line repeaters  where cost sensitivity is balanced by the need for power conservation 
mixed signal products 
telcom s mixed signal semiconductors which are distinct from mixed signal devices that incorporate analog and digital semiconductors in a single device include system a d converters  display a d converters  voltage references and chopper stabilized amplifiers 
the company is expanding its position as a supplier of integrating a d converters by introducing devices with higher accuracy resolution and increased functionality 
the company is also developing relationships with customers in the field of portable measuring instrumentation used in temperature monitoring  automotive diagnostics and field test equipment 
mixed signal products are integral to the a d interface found in a wide range of applications  such as precision scales and tympanic thermometers 
process control and data acquisition systems also benefit from the inherent capability of dual slope a d converters to reject line interference 
the company s chopper stabilized amplifiers are used in precision amplification of very low level signals in the microvolt millionth of a volt range often encountered with strain gauges 
these amplifiers have extremely low drift over both temperature and time 
by using its bicmos and cmos processes  the company s products span a wide range of currents from milliamps to amps 
smart sensor products 
the increasing trend towards lightweight  high performance pcs and other products has necessitated smaller enclosures and faster microprocessors  resulting in a significant increase in the amount of heat generated within such products 
telcom s range of solid state thermal management devices is aimed at monitoring and warning of fault conditions and solving thermal management problems 
for example  the company s proprietary tc temperature sensor protects advanced microprocessor based systems by monitoring the temperature of the microprocessor and automatically turning off the system when the system temperature exceeds a specified threshold 
the company s success depends upon its ability to develop new analog circuits for existing and new markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have such products gain market acceptance 
the development of new analog circuits is highly complex and from time to time the company has experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
moreover  successful product design and development is dependent on the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified analog design engineers  of which there is a limited number 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
due to the complexity and variety of analog circuits  the limited number of analog circuit designers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of analog circuits  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
although the company seeks to design products that have the potential to become industry standard products  there can be no assurance that any products introduced by the company will be adopted by such market leaders  or that any products initially accepted by the company s customers that are market leaders will become industry standard products 
the company s failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could materially and adversely affect its business and operating results 
the company s results of operations are dependent on the balance between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume proprietary products and relatively higher volume but lower margin second source products 
in order to improve its margins  sales of proprietary products must in the future represent a greater percentage of the company s net revenues  requiring the company to successfully develop  introduce and market new proprietary products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in its key markets will demand 
design and process technology design technology 
the design of analog circuits involves the design and interconnection of a variety of circuits and features to achieve the desired function 
the specific placement and interrelationship of these circuits is both complex and critical to the performance of the analog circuit 
computer aided design and engineering tools  which have proliferated and enhanced the design effort for digital integrated circuits  have proven to be useful but less effective for analog devices 
consequently  analog circuit design has traditionally been highly dependent on the skills and expertise of individual design engineers 
the company s design engineers principally focus on developing next generation standard products  using computer simulation models to design products that both meet the high performance characteristics required by customers and adjust for process and temperature variations 
telcom s new product development strategy emphasizes a broad line of standard products that are based on customer input and needs 
the company is currently developing products to further expand the number of offerings within each of the mixed signal  power management and smart sensor product families 
process technology 
since telcom has its own wafer fabrication facility  the company can design and produce analog circuits using multiple manufacturing processes which can be tailored to optimize product performance  minimize manufacturing cost and increase production flexibility 
the company believes that this flexibility allows the company s designers to select the optimal process technology for a given product and function 
at its wafer fabrication facility  telcom utilizes cmos  bipolar and bicmos process technologies 
the process technology used for a particular product is driven by product specifications and customer requirements 
cmos technology is the technology best suited for low power battery operated applications  and has the advantages of low power consumption and high packing density 
a substantial majority of the company s current products utilize some version of the cmos process 
bipolar technology is utilized where precision analog elements are required and is best suited for high gain  high speed  high precision and high voltage product applications 
the availability of the company s bipolar process provides additional flexibility for the company s design engineers 
the company s voltage reference products utilize the company s bipolar process 
the company also has the capability to run a bicmos process which merges the bipolar and cmos technologies 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  the company must develop or obtain access to new semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity and improve manufacturing yields 
in order to have access to new semiconductor process technologies  particularly for products requiring submicron processing  the company made an investment in ic works  inc in november which was to provide the company with a supply of submicron wafers for a five year period 
in  the company was able to design and have manufactured several new products at the ic works foundry 
however  due to financial issues  ic works is scheduled to shut down its wafer manufacturing foundry in april in order to have continued access to this type of manufacturing capability  the company is in the process of qualifying a new foundry to replace the ic works capability 
there can be no assurance that such other foundry will be qualified in a timely manner or the transition to such foundry will not delay production of certain products 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
if the company is unable to develop or obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies as they become needed  or is unable to define  design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company s ability to compete successfully depends on being able to use advanced analog process technologies to manufacture its products 
there can be no assurance that the analog process technology utilized by the company will not become obsolete 
sales  distribution and marketing the company s sales and marketing effort is focused on the development of relationships with leading companies in its targeted markets  and its sales and marketing resources are deployed to establish and enhance such relationships 
telcom currently employs sales managers and application engineers in sales  marketing and applications organizations in the united states  europe  and asia 
the company s products are sold to over  end user customers throughout the world  either directly or through its distributor network 
sales to customers in north america  europe and asia accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales for  and  and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company s two largest oem customers  motorola and compaq computer  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales for  and and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company anticipates that it will continue to be dependent or may increase its dependence on a number of key customers and distributors for a significant portion of its net sales 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers for any reason could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company sells its products through a direct sales staff and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
the direct sales staff works with leading customers to determine customer requirements and interfaces with design engineers to achieve client solutions and also manages the company s network of sales representatives and distributors 
the company sells its products in europe through an independent sales representative firm and various independent stocking representative distributor firms 
sales in asia are handled through various independent stocking representative distributor firms 
the stocking representatives distributor firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or act as the company s agent in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s sales organization provides direction and support to the independent sales representative firms  the distributor firms and the overseas independent stocking representatives distributor firms 
the company currently utilizes independent sales representative firms at various locations in the united states and canada 
the company also sells its products through national distributor firms 
sales through future electronics  the company s principal national distributor  accounted for and of the company s net sales for and  respectively 
consistent with standard industry practice  the national and regional distributor firms are entitled to certain price rebates and are allowed to return to the company a portion of the products purchased by them 
the company s distributors sell competitors products and are not within the control of the company 
loss of one or more of the company s current distributors or disruption in the company s sales and distribution channels could materially and adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company has contracts with all of its international distributors  the material terms of which typically include the following a the distributor is appointed as a non exclusive authorized distributor for a designated territory  b the distributor may return up to of its net sales in the prior month period as a credit against a new order of equal or greater amount of product  c the distributor is obligated to meet certain information reporting requirements  d the term of the contract is one year and is automatically renewable for one year periods and e the contract may be terminated at any time by either party upon days written notice 
the company also has contracts with its national distributors  including future electronics  which are substantially similar to the international distributor agreements 
international sales accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales for and  respectively 
the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales 
international sales and operations involve various risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
the company is also subject to general political risks in connection with its international operations  such as political and economic instability 
in addition  because a substantial majority of the company s international sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products  the sales of which are denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that regulatory  political and other factors will not adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
the company attempts to stock products in quantities that are sufficient to meet customer demand 
due to the fairly long product manufacturing cycle characteristic of semiconductor manufacturing and the inherent imprecision in forecasting customer demand  product inventories may not always correspond to product demand  leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products 
the company warrants that its products are free from defects in workmanship and materials for one year and that they meet the published specifications 
warranty expenses to date have been nominal 
manufacturing a substantial majority of the company s wafers are manufactured at its facility in mountain view  california 
this  square foot manufacturing facility contains a  square foot clean room 
certain production processes  such as epitaxial services  ion implantation  background and backside gold application  are performed by local subcontractors 
the mountain view clean room facility consists of class through class  areas depending on the specific area of the clean room a class clean room has fewer than foreign particles larger than micron in size in each cubic foot of space 
this facility produced an average of approximately  wafers per month during the fourth quarter of all of the company s production utilizes inch wafers 
the company believes that during the fourth quarter of  it was utilizing approximately of its production capacity at that time 
the company currently manufactures a substantial majority of its products at its wafer fabrication facility in mountain view  california 
during periods of decreased demand  high fixed wafer fabrication costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  the company s operating results were adversely impacted due to lower factory utilization at the company s manufacturing facility 
furthermore  the company is dependent on a number of local subcontractors for certain of its manufacturing processes 
for example  reaction technology  inc provides epitaxial services for approximately of the company s wafers 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform these processes on a timely basis could result in manufacturing delays  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
currently  the company purchases on a purchase order basis inch wafers from only two suppliers  komatsu silicon usa inc and lg international  and such supply is subject to long ordering lead times 
any disruption or termination of supply from either of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in  approximately of the company s sales were from wafers manufactured at its mountain view facility 
going forward  however  many of the company s new products will be manufactured by outside wafer foundries 
at the present time  there are several wafer foundries that are capable of supplying the company s needs at acceptable prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will always be able to find the necessary foundry capacity 
for example  in  there was a scarcity of world wide submicron foundry capacity 
if that condition were to be repeated in the future  the company s ability to secure wafer capacity would be adversely affected and its wafer costs would likely increase 
such actions would have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
after fabrication and initial testing at the company s mountain view  california facility  wafers are sent to the company s wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong which distributes them to contract assembly houses  primarily in malaysia and thailand  to be packaged 
upon completion of the packaging operation  the units are returned to telcom hong kong for final testing and are then shipped to customers worldwide 
the hong kong facility  which is leased by the company  is approximately  square feet and is presently testing approximately eight million units per month 
the packaging of the company s products is performed by a limited group of subcontractors and certain of the raw materials included in such products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
although the company seeks to reduce its dependence on its sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of any of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  a prolonged inability to obtain raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to customer relationships 
the company also depends on third party subcontractors  and all of the company s products are currently assembled by independent third parties in asia 
in the event that any of the company s subcontractors were to experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to the company  the company s operating results would be adversely affected until alternate subcontractors  if any  became available 
telcom designs and manufactures its own test equipment which can test both the individual die in wafer form and the finished assembled unit 
the company believes the cost of its in house tester is substantially less than the cost of purchasing an equivalent tester from an outside vendor 
in addition to the cost advantages  the company can also standardize its operations on one tester type and can therefore upgrade tester capability more easily than if it had purchased different testers from more than one vendor 
the company believes it is better able to meet its internal demand for test capacity by building its own testers because it is not subject to long lead times from outside vendors in times of rising demand for such equipment 
the company could purchase testers from outside vendors if it experienced problems in producing its own testers  but such equipment would be more costly 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failure  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the majority of the company s costs of manufacturing are relatively fixed  and  consequently  the number of shippable die per wafer for a given product is critical to the company s results of operations 
to the extent the company does not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or experiences product shipment delays  its financial condition or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced lower than expected production yields  which have delayed product shipments and adversely affected gross margins 
for example  in the quarter ended december   the company experienced lower production volumes in order to reduce inventories  which adversely effected gross margins 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in order to meet anticipated future demand  the company believes that it will need to increase its manufacturing capacity 
failure to do so could result in a loss of customers  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
research and development the ability of the company to compete successfully will depend substantially on its ability to define  design  develop and introduce on a timely basis new products offering design or technology innovations 
research and development in the analog integrated circuit industry is characterized primarily by circuit design and product engineering that enables new functionality or improved performance 
the company s research and development efforts are also directed at improving process technologies  reducing the cost of existing manufacturing processes  developing new process capabilities to manufacture new products and adding new features to existing products 
with respect to more established products  the company s research and development efforts also include product redesign  shrinkage of device size and reduction of mask steps in order to improve yields per wafer and reduce per device costs 
as of december   the company had employees engaged in research and development 
the company s research and development efforts are dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified analog design engineers  of which there is a limited supply 
the company also utilizes independent contractors for certain research and development projects 
in  and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
the company expects that it will continue to invest substantial funds in research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully and develop and bring to market such new products or that the company will be able to respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
there also can be no assurance that the company s new products will be accepted by the market 
moreover  the end markets for the company s new products  such as the communications and computer markets  are subject to rapid technological change and there can be no assurance that as such markets change the company s product offerings will remain current and suitable for them 
intellectual property the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its manufacturing processes  products and development and testing tools 
the company seeks patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which it believes such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to the company 
the company currently holds united states patents on semiconductor devices and methods with various expiration dates  none earlier than may the company has applications for twelve united states patents currently pending 
the company also holds one foreign patent 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and there can be no assurance that its current patents or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
the company may in the future be subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies 
although the company is not currently a party to any material litigation  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patents  maskwork rights  or copyrights on certain of the company s products and technologies 
although the company is not currently a party to any material litigation  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license relating to such intellectual property was not available on commercially reasonable terms  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to the company and diversion of its resources  may also be necessary to enforce patents or other intellectual property rights of the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the occurrence of litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
competition the analog semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the analog market for standard products include product features  performance  price  the timing of product introductions  the emergence of new computer standards  quality and customer support 
the company believes that it competes favorably in each of these areas 
because the standard products market for analog integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various product markets 
the company s principal competitors include linear technology corporation  maxim integrated products and harris semiconductor in one or more of its product areas 
other competitors include motorola  national semiconductor corporation  unitrode corporation and certain japanese manufacturers 
each of these companies has substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
due to the increasing demands for analog circuits  the company expects intensified competition from existing analog circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of the company s products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
backlog the company s backlog consists of distributor and oem customer orders required to be shipped within six months following the order date 
customers may generally cancel or reschedule orders to purchase products without significant penalty to the customer 
as a result  the quantities of the company s products to be delivered and their delivery schedules are frequently revised by customers to reflect changes in their needs 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty  the company does not believe its backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees  of whom were engaged in manufacturing including testing  quality and materials functions  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in finance and administration 
of such employees  are located in hong kong and are located in europe 
the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly its analog design engineers  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced circuit designers  systems applications engineers and sales managers 
the competition for such employees is intense 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s design engineers  of which there is a limited number  executive officers or other key personnel or the company s inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel

item description of property the company s main executive  administrative  manufacturing and technical offices are located in a  square foot facility in mountain view  california 
the lease on this facility expires in december and has a five year renewal option 
the company fabricates its wafers at this facility 
its activities are subject to federal  state and local environmental and land use regulations 
the company also leases  square feet of additional space in hong kong in which it conducts testing and from which it ships products to customers worldwide 
the lease on the hong kong facility expires in july the company believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet its needs for at least the next months 
federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in the company s manufacturing process and on the facility occupied by the company 
the company believes that its activities conform to present environmental and land use regulations applicable to its operations and its current facilities 
increasing public attention has  however  been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
there can be no assurance that applicable land use and environmental regulations will not in the future impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon the company or restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
in this regard  in the city of mountain view  where the company s wafer fabrication facility is located  adopted an ordinance which restricts the storage and use of hazardous materials within the proximity of certain sensitive uses  including hospitals  day care facilities and schools 
although telcom s existing operations are not affected by such ordinance  there can be no assurance that this ordinance will not materially adversely affect the company s future operations 
the adoption of this ordinance or similar measures or any failure by the company to comply with applicable environmental and land use regulations or to restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject the company to future liability or cause its manufacturing operations to be curtailed or suspended 
the company acquired the semiconductor manufacturing operations of teledyne  inc previously conducted at the company s facility 
the semiconductor manufacturing operations conducted by teledyne components at the facility allegedly contaminated the soil and groundwater of the facility and the groundwater of properties located down gradient of the facility 
although the company was indemnified by teledyne as part of the acquisition transaction against  among other things  any liabilities arising from such contamination  there can be no assurance that claims will not be made against the company or that such indemnification will be available or will provide meaningful protection at the time any such claim is brought 
to the extent the company is subject to a claim which is not covered by the indemnity from teledyne or as to which teledyne is unable to provide indemnification  the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although the company may be considered a successor in interest to teledyne s operations at the mountain view facility  the company believes that it is unlikely to be subject to any material environmental liabilities relating to the operations of the facility conducted by teledyne because i the company has received no notice from any regulatory authority or any other person claiming that the company is responsible for the contamination caused by teledyne or the cost of any clean up relating thereto and ii the company is indemnified by teledyne under the acquisition agreements and lease between the company and teledyne with respect to any such liabilities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk related factors set forth herein 
overview the company came into existence in december as a result of a management led buyout of the teledyne components division from teledyne 
the company manufactures both proprietary and second source products 
average selling prices for the company s proprietary products have tended to decline at a slower rate than have those for the company s second source products  which are more susceptible to competitive pricing pressures 
the company generally recognizes higher gross margins on its proprietary products than on its second source products 
in november  the company entered into certain agreements with ic works  inc  a privately held company located in san jose  california 
pursuant to such agreements  the company purchased million of preferred stock of ic works and provided million in capital equipment 
in return for this investment  telcom received a guarantee of submicron wafer capacity at specified prices for a period of five years  projected to start in late the shortage of wafer capacity projected in late has diminished and since late  substantial foundry capacity has been available worldwide while overall demand has not increased proportionately 
consequently  wafer pricing has decreased dramatically  which has changed the economic viability of the foundry business in which the company invested 
as a result  in  the company recorded a loss of million on its foundry investment which consists of a million write down of the preferred stock  a loss on the sale of the equipment of million  and 
million of costs associated with prepayment penalties on financing of the equipment and legal fees 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  inc  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold the million of equipment at ic works for million and invested an additional million in preferred stock of ic works  inc this agreement terminates the company s operating agreement with ic works and its wafer production arrangement was amended to allow the company to purchase wafers for a period of time prior to finding an alternative supplier  up to april the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if the company is unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain its product mix between proprietary and second source products or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of its existing products  the company s operating results will be adversely affected 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of the company s backlog is cancelable without penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs on the semiconductor industry  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company has experienced and may in the future experience material adverse fluctuations in its operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past and would in the future materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data of the company as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales costs of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative loss on foundry investment total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income expense  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million or  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales volume in the company s power management product line 
net sales in for the company s geographical areas of the united states  asia and europe accounted for   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  in sales to the company s two largest oem customers  motorola and compaq were million or and million or  respectively  of net sales in compared to million or and million or  respectively  of net sales in gross margin 
gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin was caused by increased production volume in the company s wafer fabrication facility due to higher demand  increased efficiency in wafer fabrication and higher gross margins on sales of power management products 
the company s ability to increase gross margins will depend on the successful introduction of its new proprietary products and increasing manufacturing output at the company s wafer fabrication facility to spread the fixed costs over an increasing number of units  thereby reducing the fixed costs per unit 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in research and development expenses  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to cost of wafers and associated expense for new products  and costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of computer aided design cad systems for design engineers 
the company expects research and development expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars in future periods although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in absolute dollars  primarily as a result of i the hiring of sales personnel  ii an increase in outside sales commissions due to higher sales  and iii the distribution of management bonus and company wide profit sharing to all employees 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars in the future periods although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
loss on foundry investment 
in november  the company entered into certain agreements with ic works  inc a privately held company located in san jose  california 
pursuant to these agreements  in the company purchased million of preferred stock of ic works and provided million in capital equipment 
in return for this investment  the company received a guarantee of submicron wafer capacity at specified prices for a period of five years  projected to start in late the shortage of wafer capacity projected in late has diminished and since late  substantial foundry capacity has been available worldwide while overall demand has not increased proportionately 
consequently  wafer pricing has decreased dramatically  which has changed the economic viability of the foundry business in which the company invested 
as a result  in  the company recorded a loss of million on its foundry investment which consists of a million write down of the preferred stock  a loss on the sale of the equipment of million  and 
million of costs associated with prepayment penalties on financing of the equipment and legal fees 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  inc  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold the million of equipment at ic works for million and invested an additional million in preferred stock of ic works  inc this agreement terminates the company s operating agreement with ic works and its wafer production arrangement was amended to allow the company to purchase wafers for a period of time prior to finding an alternative supplier  up to april interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased from  in to an expense of  in  reflecting higher interest expense associated with equipment financing 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in at an effective rate of compared to an income tax benefit of  in at an effective rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due to the non deductibility of certain foundry investment losses and a tax charge relating to repatriation of certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales in were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales volume in mixed signal commodity products and temperature sensor products  experienced both in asia and the united states 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by increased sales volume in asia in power management products 
net sales in for the company s geographical areas of the united states  asia and europe accounted for   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  in sales to the company s two largest oem customers  motorola and compaq totaled million in compared to million in gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to i lower factory utilization of the company s manufacturing facilities ii lower yields in wafer fabrication and iii lower gross margins on high volume products in its power management products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to i increased staffing for design engineers and layout designers  ii the higher level of mask sets and wafer runs for new products  and iii costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of computer aided design cad systems for design engineers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the hiring of sales personnel in all geographical areas and increased staffing levels in the company s management information system department 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased from  in to  in  reflecting higher interest expense associated with equipment financing 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in at an effective rate of compared to million of expense in at a rate of 
the change in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the mix of net income loss arising from the various geographical regions where tax rates range from to and changes in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources in  the company generated approximately million from operating activities  principally from net income of million  depreciation of million  taxes payable of million and current liabilities of million 
these cash increases were primarily offset by growth in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  and an increase in net deferred taxes of  the company invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements in the company financed part of this investment through notes payable  which increased million  on a net basis  in in  the company generated approximately million from operating activities  principally from depreciation of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of  these increases in cash were primarily offset by taxes receivable of million and taxes payable of million 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements of which million was for purchases of capital equipment pursuant to an agreement with ic works  inc in the company financed part of this investment through notes payable  which increased million on a net basis 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  inc  the company invested million in preferred stock of ic works  inc in in  the company generated approximately million from operating activities  primarily from income before the loss on foundry investment  depreciation of million and a net increase of million in working capital items 
the net increase in working capital primarily reflects a decrease of income tax receivable of million  due to collection of tax refunds recorded in the prior year  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in taxes payable of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  due to higher fourth quarter sales than the prior year  and an increase in inventory of million  due to an increase in inventory in the company s sensor product line 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
pursuant to an agreement with ic works  inc  in the fourth quarter of  the company sold the million of equipment at ic works for million and invested an additional million in preferred stock of ic works  inc this agreement terminates the company s operating agreement with ic works and its wafer production arrangement was amended to allow the company to purchase wafers for a period of time prior to finding an alternative supplier  up to april in  the company invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company financed million of this investment through notes payable and paid million in principal payments of which million was for equipment sold as part of the ic works agreement and million was principal payments on other equipment financing for prior years 
the company expects capital expenditures of million in and has commitments related to such expenditures of million 
the company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations and its existing financing sources will be sufficient to support its operating and capital needs for the next twelve months 
any major change in the nature of the company s business  such as the acquisition of products  the need for significant new capital expenditures or the acquisition of an existing business  could change the company s capital requirements 
to the extent the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
year issues there is a risk to the company from unforeseen problems related to the year issue 
the year issue arises because most computer systems and programs were designed to handle only a two digit year  not a four digit year 
when year begins  these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
the company has recently performed an initial assessment of its information systems and does not anticipate any internal year issues from its own information systems  databases or programs 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors  and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is in the process of developing a plan to determine the impact that third parties who are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
market risk disclosure interest rate risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
at december   the company s investment portfolio is comprised of municipal government securities that mature within one year 
the company places investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of the company s sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to the company s consolidated results of operations
