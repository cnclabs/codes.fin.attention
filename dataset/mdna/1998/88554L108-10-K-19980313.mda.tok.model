item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations annual table percentages of net sales the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research and development operating income loss other income income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were million for  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million for the sales increase was as a result of several new programs in for a variety of customers  including a major office automation customer 
in  the company s largest customer accounted for net sales of million compared with net sales of million to that customer in  for an overall decrease of percent 
the company s major customer accounted for approximately percent of net sales for compared with approximately percent for one other customer accounted for million  or percent of the net sales  in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent for as compared with percent for the corresponding increase in the gross margin was the result of a number of factors  including decreased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  decreased unfavorable manufacturing variances occurring as a result of increased manufacturing volume  labor utilization  and material purchases  and a more mature product mix with higher margins and better yields 
in the third quarter of  the company took a special one time provision for excess and obsolete inventory related primarily to end of life programs for which the majority of shipments  expected to occur in the latter part of  never materialized 
furthermore  the company was required to make significant design modifications to a new product  which also resulted in obsolete inventory 
without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in the third quarter of  the cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  would have been percent for selling  general  and administrative expense was million for  as compared with million in selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in absolute terms as a result of increased selling expenses and the addition of administrative personnel 
as a result of increased revenue in  however  selling  general  and administrative expense declined to percent of net sales from percent of net sales in research and development expense totaled million  or percent of net sales  for as compared with million  or percent of net sales  for research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists and other personnel  related facilities costs  including certain expenses associated with the development of new processes on the lcd line in tempe  arizona  and various expenses for projects 
research and development expense has increased as the company has invested in new technologies and manufacturing processes  developed new potential products  and continued its in house process development efforts related to the high volume manufacturing lcd line 
the company believes that continued investments in research and development relating to manufacturing processes and new display technology are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace  as well as to provide opportunities for growth 
interest income net for was  up from  for the increase in interest income was the result of investing higher average cash balances during the year 
other expenses net increased to  for from  for the increase was primarily attributed to foreign exchange losses 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  as compared with a benefit from income taxes of million for this resulted primarily from having a loss in as compared with reporting net income in the overall tax rate for the company for was percent as compared with percent for the company expects that the tax rate for will approximate percent 
for  the company reported net income of million  or per share diluted  as compared with a net loss of million  or per share diluted  for without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in  the company would have reported net income of  or per share  in year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were million for  a decrease of percent compared with net sales of million for the sales decrease was primarily a result of lower order rates from the company s major customer for existing product programs 
during the first quarter of  that customer  which is in the wireless communications industry  informed the company that it had made an unexpected decision to begin phasing out certain of its cellular products that used display modules which comprised the company s highest volume  longest running programs 
subsequently  the phase out of those programs occurred even more quickly than the company had anticipated or its customer had initially indicated 
the sudden and unexpected reduction of those programs was the greatest contributor to the reduced revenue in the long product development time in the custom display business prevented the company from quickly replacing the phased out programs 
in  the company s largest customer accounted for net sales of million compared with net sales of million to that customer for  for an overall decrease of percent 
the company s major customer accounted for approximately percent of the net sales for compared with approximately percent for all other customers accounted for net sales of million for compared with net sales of million for cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent for as compared with percent for the corresponding decline in the gross margin was the result of a number of factors  including increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  manufacturing variances occurring as a result of decreased manufacturing volume and material purchases  and sales of low margin products 
in the third quarter of  the company took a special one time provision for excess and obsolete inventory related primarily to end of life programs for which the majority of shipments  expected to occur in the latter part of  never materialized 
furthermore  the company was required to make significant design modifications to a new product  which also resulted in obsolete inventory 
without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in the third quarter  the cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  would have been percent for selling  general  and administrative expense was million for  the same as in as a result of reduced revenue in  however  selling  general  and administrative expense rose to percent of net sales from percent of net sales in research and development expense totaled million  or percent of net sales  for as compared with million  or percent of net sales  for research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists and other personnel  related facilities costs  including certain expenses associated with the start up and continued operations of the lcd line in tempe  arizona  and various expenses for projects 
interest income net for was  down from  for the decrease in interest income was the result of investing lower average cash balances during the year 
other expenses net increased to  for from  for an increase in closed facilities expenses and foreign exchange losses in was partially offset by decreased net losses on the sale of assets 
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of million for  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million for this resulted primarily from having a loss in as compared with reporting net income in the reported tax rate for the company in the fourth quarter of was lower than normal because of an adjustment related to the difference between tax accruals and taxes actually incurred 
this adjustment was  and was reflected in the reduced tax provision in the fourth quarter of the overall tax rate for the company for was percent as compared with percent for for  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share diluted  as compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in the third quarter  the company would have reported net income of  or per share diluted in quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated financial results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the company believes that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 
quarters ended in thousands  except per share amounts mar june sept dec mar june sept dec net sales         costs and expenses cost of sales         selling  general  and administrative         research and development        operating income loss       other income expense interest  net other  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes 
      provision for benefit from income taxes    net income loss     earnings loss per common share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares basic         diluted         liquidity and capital resources during  the company generated million in cash flow from operations as compared with million during the decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable versus the reductions in accounts receivable that occurred in and the increase in inventory 
the increase in inventory and accounts receivable occurred primarily as a result of the increased sales activity in depreciation expense in was million versus million in this increase was primarily as a result of an increased number of starts on the lcd manufacturing line in tempe  arizona 
the high volume lcd line is depreciated on a units of production method based on units started 
the company anticipates that depreciation will rise in as a result of additional capital expenditures in  including a new building and equipment for the proposed manufacturing facility in china  the installation of additional equipment in its manila manufacturing location  and the installation of equipment in tempe  arizona to manufacture liquid crystal on silicon lcos tm microdisplays 
the company s working capital was million at december   up from million at december  the company s current ratio at december  was to as compared with a current ratio of to at december  including its cash and loan commitments  the company had over million in readily available funds on december  in may  the company entered into a new million revolving line of credit with imperial bank  which matures may  at december   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 
advances under the revolving line may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate 
the company s subsidiary  three five systems limited  has established an annually renewable credit facility with a united kingdom bank  barclays bank plc  in order to fund its working capital requirements 
the facility provides  of borrowing capacity secured by accounts receivable of three five systems limited 
advances under the credit facility are based on accounts receivable  as defined  and accrue interest  which is payable quarterly  at the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the united kingdom credit facility matures june  three five systems limited had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at december  in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to one million shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
as of december    treasury shares had been purchased by the company at a total cost of  capital expenditures during were approximately million  as compared with  during capital expenditures for consisted primarily of manufacturing and office equipment for the company s operations in manila and arizona and laboratory equipment for research and development 
the company anticipates that it will increase its capital expenditures during those expenditures will primarily relate to advanced manufacturing processes  the high volume lcd line  and necessary manufacturing equipment 
the company anticipates that it will spend approximately million in early on the capital equipment needed to manufacture lcos tm microdisplays 
a major portion of that equipment already is on order 
the company also has decided to expand its overseas manufacturing capabilities in by opening a manufacturing facility in beijing  china 
the company anticipates the facilities and capital cost for china in to be approximately million 
the company anticipates that accounts receivable and inventory will rise in if revenue levels increase as currently anticipated 
the company believes that its existing capital  and anticipated cash flow from operations and credit lines will provide adequate sources to fund operations and planned expenditures throughout should the company encounter additional cash requirements  however  the company may have to expand its loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raising capital 
effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company generally sells its products and services and negotiates purchase orders with its foreign suppliers in united states dollars 
an exception is the company s sub assembly agreement in the philippines  which is based on a fixed conversion rate  exposing the company to exchange rate fluctuations with the philippine peso 
although the company has not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date  there has been some minor benefit as a result of the recent peso devaluation 
if the peso devaluation were to continue  a substantial portion of the benefit to the company will likely be offset by an increase in the philippine labor rates and costs 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
the company is planning to commence operations in china in although the chinese currency currently is stable  there can be no assurance that it will remain so in the future 
the company from time to time may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
business outlook and risk factors this business outlook section has numerous forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors associated with those forward looking statements are set forth in risk factors below 
other important risk factors are set forth under special considerations in item of this report 
the company offers advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers 
the company specializes in custom displays and front panel displays utilizing liquid crystal display lcd and light emitting diode led components and technology 
the company experienced substantial growth from through with such growth dependent primarily upon the company s participation in the substantial growth of the wireless communications market and sales to a single major customer in that industry 
in  the company s sales declined  largely as a result of the phase out by that major customer of a significant family of programs in early in  sales returned to pre levels primarily as a result of several new programs and customers  including a major office automation customer 
the company had substantial growth in its revenues in with a percent rate of growth over fourth quarter revenues in were almost percent greater than first quarter revenues in this growth occurred because several new programs began production in the second and third quarters of while many existing programs were in the middle of their life cycles 
in  more than percent of revenue occurred in the second  third and fourth quarters 
in  the company anticipates that this type of revenue pattern will be repeated 
the company believes that a pattern of seasonality may be developing as oems with retail products develop shorter product life cycles and introduce new programs early in the year following holiday sales 
although the company expects some significant new programs to begin ramping up production in  several existing programs are nearing the completion of their natural life cycles 
previously  the company expected some of the new programs to begin to ramp up production in the first quarter prior to the completion of the mature programs 
as the result of customer design issues  it now appears that those new programs will not begin to ramp up until the second and third quarter in a manner similar to the ramp up that occurred in as a result  the revenue from those new programs will not be available in the first quarter to offset the loss of revenue occurring from the completion of the older programs 
thus  sales in the first quarter of will decline over sales in the fourth quarter of the company s estimated backlog of manufacturing revenue for programs currently in design is substantially greater than it was at the end of therefore  if additional programs currently in development begin to ramp up their production levels in the second and third quarter of as anticipated  the company should continue its year over year growth rate in in the past several quarters  the company has undertaken substantial efforts to diversify its business  broaden its customer base  and expand its markets  and the company intends to continue those efforts 
the company s historical major customer  which accounted for approximately percent of the company s revenue in  accounted for percent of the company s revenue in and slightly less than percent of the company s revenue in this reduced percentage occurred as a result of the increased sales to other customers and reduced product selling prices and overall revenue from that major customer 
late in  that major customer instituted an allocation process for awarding lcd module business 
although the allocation does not provide a guarantee of business  the company anticipates that business with that customer will increase in at a rate faster than increases in business with other customers 
therefore  the percentage of revenue attributed to that wireless communications customer may increase in  but the current business plan of the company targets that customer to account for no more than percent of its revenue 
another customer also accounted for percent of the company s revenue in  but the company expects this percentage to decline significantly over the next few quarters as current programs reach the end of their cycles and replacement programs with lower selling prices are introduced 
the company s gross margins are impacted by several factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  product differentiation  product uniqueness  billings for non recurring engineering services  engineering costs  product mix  and volume pricing 
generally  higher volume programs using more generic  low information content lcd displays have lower margins 
as the production levels of some of the company s new high volume programs increase in early  the gross margins on those programs  which are generally lower  may have more of an impact on the company s overall margins 
in addition  many of the company s competitors are asian suppliers  and a strong dollar gives a competitive pricing advantage to those suppliers 
thus  the company may see competitive margin pressure from asian suppliers  particularly those in korea and japan 
it is a goal of the company  however  for increased manufacturing efficiencies to occur on those high volume programs in order to maintain its gross margins at existing levels  although those efficiencies should not positively impact the company s gross margins until after the first quarter of the company also expects that more advanced display modules  expected to be introduced later in  will command higher margins and should enable the company to maintain its overall gross margins in the same range as the gross margins in as the company expands and diversifies its product and customer base  it may have to further increase its selling  general  and administrative expenses 
serving a variety of customers with complex and differing issues requires increased personnel committed to those customers 
as a result  the actual dollar amount of the selling  general  and administrative expenses in should be to percent greater than in  although sg a expenditures as a percentage of net sales should continue decreasing in the company believes that continued investments in research and development relating to new display technology and manufacturing processes are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace as well as to provide opportunities for growth 
in  the company continued to expand and intensify its internal research and development to focus on proprietary display products rather than emphasizing manufacturing process improvements 
use of the lcd manufacturing line in tempe  arizona as a resource for the testing of the new ideas is the key to the development of these products  some of which will be proprietary and not available from other display manufacturers 
in addition  the development of the high volume manufacturing lcd line has helped reduce the company s dependence on foreign suppliers of lcd glass 
the company also intends to pursue technologies being developed in related fields 
the company operates the highest volume fully automated lcd manufacturing line in north america 
as a result  several companies have approached the company about potential alliances 
the company believes that a strategic alliance with one or more of those companies could minimize the cost of entry into new markets and new technologies 
in august  national semiconductor corporation and the company entered into a strategic supplier alliance agreement for the development and manufacture of lcos tm microdisplays 
under the alliance  the two companies are working together in developing the lcos tm technology with each company focusing on its core competency of silicon and lcds  respectively 
the company also is considering licensing technologies from other companies that could be optimized on the lcd manufacturing line 
this internal and external focus on research and development will continue indefinitely 
as a result  the actual dollar amount of such expenditures in should increase over  although research and development expenditures should decrease as a percentage of net sales in the company has decided to establish manufacturing operations in the people s republic of china 
a site was recently selected in beijing  and an individual with management experience in china was hired to act as the general manager and vice president for the china operations 
the company plans to establish chinese manufacturing operations in for several reasons 
first  based upon its growth expectations for in the european and united states marketplaces  the company anticipates a need for manufacturing capacity beyond what is available at its philippine location 
china was selected because of the desire to diversify manufacturing locations and because of the cost benefits that are expected to be achieved in china 
the company also believes that locating a portion of its manufacturing operations in china will create synergistic opportunities for the company because many of the components used in the company s products are manufactured in china 
second  many of the company s existing and potential customers maintain manufacturing operations near the proposed china location 
despite the current asian situation  those customers continue to require lcd modules and the company participates very little in that market 
currently  there are few lcd module manufacturers in china 
under current chinese government rules  however  oems in china have a strong motivation to utilize locally manufactured components 
the company expects some start up costs in associated with its manufacturing operations in china in advance of the first revenues from china  which are expected to occur in the third or fourth quarter of other important risk factors are set forth under special considerations in item of this report 
risk factors forward looking statements in this report include revenue  margin  expense  and earnings analysis for as well as the company s expectations relating to operations in china  future technologies  and future design and production orders 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends  developments  and factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve its goals 
in addition  there are trends  developments  and factors beyond the company s control that may affect its operations 
the cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this document  and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission  identify important trends  factors  and currently known developments that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements contained in this report and in any written or oral statements of the company 
as noted previously  two customers currently are responsible for about two thirds of the company s revenue 
as a result  the majority of the company s revenue comes from a core customer base 
any material delay  cancellation  or reduction of orders from one or more of those core customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company expects the two thirds concentration levels from those two combined customers in to continue into although the trend of the company is to enter into more manufacturing contracts with its customers  the principal benefit of these contracts is to clarify order lead times  inventory risk allocation  and similar matters and not to provide firm  long term volume purchase commitments 
the company has no firm long term volume purchase commitments from its customers 
as a result  customer commitments can be canceled and expected volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed  or reduced commitments cannot be assured and  among other things  could result in the company holding excess and obsolete inventory or having unfavorable manufacturing variances as a result of under absorption 
these risks are exacerbated because the company expects that a majority of its sales will be to customers in the retail electronics industry  which is subject to severe competitive pressures  rapid technological change  and obsolescence 
another risk inherent in custom manufacturing is the satisfactory completion of design services and securing of production orders 
a significant portion of the company s anticipated revenue for the future will come from programs currently in the design or pilot production stage 
completion of the design is dependent on a variety of factors  including the customer s changing needs  and not every design is successful in meeting those needs 
in addition  some designs test new theories or applications and may not meet the desired results 
failure of a design order to achieve the customer s desired results could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operations if the expected production order for that product was significant 
even when a design is satisfactorily completed  the customer may terminate or delay the program as a result of marketing or other pressures 
finally  the company is frequently one of several sources to a customer on a program 
therefore  the company could satisfactorily complete all phases of the design and still fail to secure significant production orders on that program because of competitive issues 
the company plans to introduce several new products over the next few years 
these new products will require significant expenditures  including expenses for custom integrated circuits as well as various capital expenditures for manufacturing capability 
for example  the company estimates that its initial capital expenditures for production of lcos tm microdisplays will require approximately million 
the failure of the company to sell one or more of these new technologies  including lcos tm microdisplays  for any reason could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition to capital expenditures for new products  the company is currently spending research and development dollars on several new technologies that it plans to introduce in the future 
there is a risk that some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab to cost effective manufacturing capability  and such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks include technology problems  competitive cost issues  and yield problems 
in addition  even if a new technology proves to be manufacturable  it may not be accepted by the company s customer and the customer s marketplace because of price or technology issues or it may compare unfavorably with products previously introduced by others 
the company designs and manufactures products based on firm quotes 
as a result  the company bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
in addition  the company depends on certain suppliers  and the unavailability or shortage of materials could cause delays or lost orders 
recently  several material components of some of the company s major programs have been subject to allocation because of shortages by vendors and continued or increased shortages could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
in addition  although most of the components purchased by the company are purchased from vendors in asian countries unaffected by the current currency crisis  a significant portion of the silicon drivers purchased by the company are manufactured in korea and japan 
the instability in certain asian countries could cause supply problems with respect to these components 
the company s primary competitors are located in asia  including  japan  korea  and hong kong  and most of the company s customers are us based 
the recent currency devaluation of several asian countries could have an impact on the gross margins of the company as the competitors products become cheaper to purchase with a stronger dollar 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries to represent years 
for example  the year would be represented by 
these systems and products will need to be able to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from prior years 
as a result  systems and products that do not accept four digit year entries will need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
currently  the company is reviewing its internal systems to determine the impact of the year requirements 
the company believes that its internal systems are year compliant or will be upgraded or replaced prior to the need to comply with year requirements  and the company does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as the result of any failure by the company to be compliant 
the company believes that the overall cost of compliance will not be material and expenses such compliance costs when incurred 
it is uncertain whether the company s customers and suppliers will have year issues that may affect the company  but the company currently is developing a plan to evaluate the year compliance status of its customers and suppliers 
finally  the company s success  especially in penetrating new markets and increasing its oem customer base  depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of services of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled employees 
failure to do so could adversely affect the company s operations 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company s stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by investors  analysts  and brokers could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  other factors  which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods for reasons unrelated to the company s performance
