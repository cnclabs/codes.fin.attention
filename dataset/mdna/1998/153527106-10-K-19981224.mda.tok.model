overview the company entered into an agreement effective october  with solaris to become both the master agent and master distributor for sales of solaris products nationwide 
management believes that the relationship with solaris embodied in the solaris agreement has had a substantial impact on the company s results of operations 
under the solaris agreement  which runs through september   the company  in addition to serving as the master agent and master distributor for sales of solaris products  provides a wide range of value added services including logistics  order processing and fulfillment  inventory distribution and merchandising 
however  solaris continues to negotiate its sales prices directly with its direct sales accounts 
as a result of the solaris agreement  a majority of the company s sales of solaris products are derived from servicing direct sales accounts  whereas in and prior  a majority of the company s sales of solaris products were made by the company as a traditional distributor 
a substantial portion of these sales consists of large shipments to retail distribution centers which are characterized by lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales compared with sales made by the company as a traditional distributor 
the company believes that the operating expenses associated with this type of sale are lower than the operating expenses associated with sales made by the company as a traditional distributor 
the company believes that the gross profit as a percentage of net sales associated with the company s services to solaris direct sales accounts is higher than the gross profit as a percentage of net sales associated with the company s historical agency sales due to the greater services provided pursuant to the solaris agreement 
the company believes that the collective impact of these factors has led to substantially increased sales of solaris products  increased gross profit from sales of solaris products as well as lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
in addition  under the solaris agreement  the company s inventories of solaris products have increased significantly since the company is not only carrying inventories to support its own sales of solaris products but also certain inventory previously carried by solaris as well as additional inventories to support sales of solaris products by the company s network of independent distributors 
the solaris agreement provides for the company to be reimbursed for costs incurred in connection with services provided to solaris direct sales accounts and to receive payments based on the growth of sales of solaris products 
the company also shares with solaris in the economic benefits of certain cost reductions  to the extent achieved 
as a result  management believes that the company s profitability is more directly attributable to the success of solaris than it has been in the past 
monsanto has announced that it intends to sell its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup herbicide products for consumer use to the scotts company scotts and that it has entered into a separate  long term  exclusive agreement pursuant to which monsanto will continue to make roundup herbicide products for consumer use and scotts will market the products 
scotts has been for many years a substantial supplier to the company and  in connection with its direct sales  a substantial purchaser of the company s services 
the company expects to enter into a new relationship with scotts effective october  since scotts will then be the company s largest lawn and garden customer by a substantial margin  the terms of this new arrangement will have a substantial impact on the company s future profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in negotiating and implementing a new relationship with scotts or that the new relationship with scotts will provide the company with comparable profitability to the profitability it has experienced from its prior relationships with solaris and scotts 
the pending sale of the solaris business by monsanto and the approaching end of the solaris agreement subject the company s lawn and garden business to significant uncertainties 
these include the negotiation of new relationships with scotts and the final accounting for all issues between the company and monsanto under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from monsanto for cost reimbursements  payments for cost reductions and payments for services  the amounts payable to monsanto for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris direct sales accounts 
the resolution of such uncertainties could have a material effect  either positive or negative  on the company s results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other charges income from operations interest expense net other income expense net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for the year ended september  increased by or million to  million from million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired 
the increase related to the existing business was attributable principally to the lawn and garden operations with modest increases in branded product sales offset in part by a decline in pet supplies distribution 
gross profit increased by or million from million during the year ended september  to million for the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year while gross profit from existing operations increased compared with  a substantial portion of the total increase relates to newly acquired businesses 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due principally to a larger proportion of higher margin branded product sales relative to total sales in fiscal the change in sales mix is primarily attributed to businesses acquired since october for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million is attributable to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this percentage increase relates to the branded product businesses acquired during fiscal this type of business has significantly higher operating costs as a percentage of sales than the lawn and garden and pet operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales from existing operations decreased slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal year as branded products become a greater percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales should continue to increase 
for the year ended september   the company recorded other charges totaling million 
these charges related principally to the closure of of the company s branch locations and costs associated with professional and due diligence expenses principally related to a potential major acquisition that was not completed 
of the operations which were closed  seven were related to the company s pet supplies business  five in the western us and two in the northeast market 
the closure and consolidation of these operations into other existing pet supplies branches was principally due to the acquisition of regional pet retailers by two major pet retailers  and in the northeast market the decision by one major retailer to purchase a larger percentage of their products either directly from manufacturers into its retail store locations or distribute these products through internal distribution centers 
as a result of these actions  the overall market for the company s pet supplies business in these geographic areas was reduced 
the costs to realign and integrate the affected operations amounted to approximately million 
the company believes that the closure of these locations will enable it to serve its customer base more cost effectively 
the closure of two of the company s southern california garden branches was done in conjunction with the transfer of certain business previously shipped from the company s central california facility 
the operations of these three branches were consolidated into a larger existing facility in southern california 
the company believes that the move will reduce shipping costs within california while at the same time provide better service to its customers 
the remaining branches which were closed related to the company s vegetable seed distribution operation in celaya  mexico  and the consolidation of the pennington seed operation in arkansas into the company s branch in arkansas 
the celaya branch was part of a larger acquisition made by the company several years ago 
since the sale of vegetable seed has never been part of the company s core business and revenues have remained modest with little growth potential  the company elected to exit this business 
net interest expense for the year ended september  increased by or million to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding debt principally related to debt assumed on the businesses acquired since october  offset in part by an increase in interest income 
interest income was earned from funds available as a result of the public offering of the company s common stock completed in january substantially all of these funds have been used to acquire businesses during fiscal average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal the average interest rates for the fiscal years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate was for both fiscal years 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for the year ended september  increased by or million to million from million for the year ended september  of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired subsequent to october  the increase related to the existing business was attributable principally to the lawn and garden operations with modest sales increases in both the pet and branded areas of the company s operations 
gross profit increased by or million from million during the year ended september  to million for the same period in gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for the year ended september  to for the comparable period 
while the existing operations reported a modest increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales  the increase is due principally to a greater percentage of higher margin pet and branded sales relative to total sales than was the case in fiscal the change in sales mix is primarily attributable to the newly acquired businesses 
for the year ended september   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for the comparable period 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to a combination of increased sales and the addition of the newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased from in the twelve months ended september  to for the similar period 
this percentage increase relates principally to the pet and branded product operations which have significantly higher operating costs as a percentage of sales than the lawn and garden operations 
as these two product areas become a greater percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales will continue to increase 
interest expense net for the year ended september  increased by or million to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is due principally to the issuance of  convertible notes in november offset  in part  by interest income earned from funds available resulting from proceeds from the issuance of both the convertible notes and a public offering of the company s common stock in july average borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for the comparable period 
the average interest rates for the fiscal years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with for the similar period 
impact of year state of readiness 
in early  the company conducted an overall assessment of its computer systems  including year readiness 
based on this assessment  the company has developed a plan to deal with the year issue  which covers both systems and vendor customer issues 
the plan includes both upgrades to or replacement of current systems to bring all of the company s systems into compliance 
many of the existing information systems used by subsidiaries or divisions acquired by the company are being replaced  primarily in response to business reasons apart from the year issue 
the company will use primarily internal resources to reprogram or replace and test its information systems for year compliance 
in addition  the company will use certain external resources to replace outdated information systems at certain of its subsidiaries operations 
the company expects that the majority of the systems changes will be complete by early  and that the remaining issues will be resolved by the summer of the plan developed to address vendor and customer issues includes systems integration  testing and communication strategies 
the company has begun the process of initiating formal communications with significant vendors and customers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to a failure by any of these third parties to remediate their own year issues 
the company is currently testing electronic data transmissions to and from its major vendors and customers to ensure year compliance 
the company expects to conclude this testing by early in addition to vendors and customers  the company also relies upon governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company s vendors or customers  governmental agencies or other third parties will not suffer a year business disruption that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
costs to address the year issue 
to date  the company has incurred no significant incremental costs addressing year issues  although it has incurred costs  independent of the year issue  relating to the implementation of new systems for certain subsidiaries 
the company has no separate budget and none is currently planned for year issues 
the company does not expect expenditures relating to the year issue to be material or to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
risks presented by the year issue 
the company presently believes that with the planned upgrades and implementation of new systems and software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition  if any third parties who provide goods or services essential to the company s business activities fail to address appropriately their year issues  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
contingency plans 
the company s year plan includes the development of contingency plans in the events that the company has not completed all of its remediation plans in a timely manner or any third parties who provide goods or services essential to the company s business fail to appropriately address their year issues 
the company expects to conclude the development of these contingency plans by the end of the third quarter of inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of securities to the public 
the company received net proceeds after offering expenses of approximately million from its five public offerings of common stock in july  november  july  august and january in november  the company completed the sale of million subordinated convertible notes generating approximately million net of underwriting commissions 
the company s business is highly seasonal and its working capital requirements and capital resources track closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
since the company s short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  this quarter is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and consequently the company s ability to borrow is at its lowest 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  principally due to the solaris agreement  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
for the twelve months ended september   the company generated cash from operating activities of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million resulted from acquisitions and equity investments during the first and second fiscal quarters and the acquisition of office and warehouse equipment 
cash generated from financing activities of million consisted principally of net proceeds from the sale of  shares of the company s stock in december and january  less repayment of million of long term debt and approximately million of short term debt 
the company has a million line of credit through december  and million thereafter with congress financial corporation western 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon a specific asset borrowing base 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate per annum and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at september   the company had million of outstanding borrowings and had million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any substantial acquisition of a business 
in connection with the acquisition of three companies in fiscal  the company assumed combined lines of credit aggregating million  of which million was available on the one line of credit that remains outstanding from these acquisitions at september  interest related to this line is based on a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus  at the company s option 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its lines of credit will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
as part of its growth strategy  the company has engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and it anticipates it will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  the company may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject the company to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
weather and seasonality historically  the company s sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the markets it serves 
for example  during the first six months of both and and the first three months of the calendar year in  the company s results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in many parts of the country 
additionally  the company s business is highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales occurred in the first six months of the calendar year 
substantially all of the company s operating income is typically generated in this period which has historically offset the operating losses incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on the company s bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose basis points  the company s results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  the company has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
commodity prices 
the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains  bird seed and grass seed 
to protect against changes in market prices  the company purchases futures contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed 
foreign currency risks 
the company has minimal sales outside of the united states and  therefore  has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
