item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in late  the company made decisions to expand the san marcos  texas office and in  decided to expand services further by opening an office in salt lake city  utah 
these decisions came after the record breaking year of the operational losses from were unacceptable 
in order to correct the corporate direction  management made several positive steps to improve the financial condition of the company 
as a result  proved to be an eventful year for the company 
in  the company had a loss of  the company has continued to reduce their texas and utah offices and for year  reduced the loss by percent over the operating loss  of which approximately  was a carryover from office reductions 
the company still plans to work in these areas  but all jobs will be run out of the casper office 
of the  loss for  the company had non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization write offs of  texas office management closely scrutinized and discovered that the operation was not productive 
it was decided to reduce the personnel expense by percent 
these changes reduced the revenues by 
clients are now being serviced and maintained by the casper  wyoming office personnel 
further cuts and complete dissolution of the texas office will be realized in salt lake city office the management of the salt lake city office has been removed from employment with the company 
all clients are now being serviced from the casper and evanston  wyoming offices 
this consolidation occurred mid to late  and resulted in a percent decrease in losses 
casper office the casper office houses the hawks corporate offices  as well as maintaining the majority of the environmental equipment and personnel for the organization 
in a cost savings move on may  management reduced the salaries of two of the three executive officers employed by the corporation the salary reductions were as follow bruce a 
hinchey james e 
meador  jr 
on may  joseph j 
mcquade s salary was reduced by 
these corrections were the keystone to a net  cost savings 
in the first quarter of  joseph j 
mcquade  ceo  terminated his employment 
as a result a significant cost savings will result 
see note  subsequent events of the accompanying financial statements 
those negotiations were successful and his departure will be effective in the first quarter of it is important to note that the majority of funding for the agreement with mr 
mcquade will come from outside investors 
evanston  wyoming office the operation of the oil and gas production analytical laboratory realized an increase of more than and the net income increased 
the equipment remained in good operational condition  fewer repairs were needed  and our major clients in the area increased our workload as oil and gas production increased 
the industry wide reduction in environmental engineering and testing services continued through mid  however the trend reversed as evidenced by client contact late in and early environmental companies nationwide have faced the downturn 
those remaining  such as west  have faired well by increasing market share 
the company purchased approximately  in property and equipment for compared to  in and  in of the  purchased   was for equipment on the three development wells drilled in brundage canyon 
we are anticipating two additional development wells in and the environmental testing business will require some additional equipment 
purchases of equipment should be held to the figure 
the company continues to attempt to sell its facilities on wn road in casper and has leased two of the three facilities which amounts to approximately of the debt service on the buildings 
the sale of either of the casper properties or the san marcos property would have a significant positive impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
the following information is provided for the years ending december  and working capital   long term debt to equity cash provided utilized by operations   cash and short term investments available    loan on office building listed as current liability 
in addition  in late the company purchased acres of undeveloped commercial real estate in casper  wyoming 
the land is adjacent to and fronts interstate and is dissected by east second street the main business thoroughfare in casper 
the land was purchased for less than cents per square foot 
business real estate development has increased at adjoining property 
there is no announced time table for development of the land 
management believes that the carrying value of producing oil and gas properties is not in excess of the future revenues which will be recovered 
carrying value of producing properties  net of depletion is  oil and gas revenues  net of expenses were  for the year 
as many of the company s producing properties are natural gas properties with lives in excess of twenty five years  we believe the carrying value of the assets is fully recoverable 
in addition  the company has carrying value of  on non producing properties which is net of an allowance for impairment of  management believes the allowance is adequate and the remaining costs in the assets will be recovered 
management knows of no environmental assessment problems nor of the potential of any such environmental assessment 
all purchased real estate has had environmental studies done prior to purchase and our environmental lab has been instructed on the appropriate procedures for disposals of various kinds of waste 
such wastes although relatively insignificant in amount are tested prior to disposal as part of an environmental assurance program 
results of operations this summarization of the results of operations will not include the activities of the discontinued operations 
the reader is referred to the section above entitled liquidity and capital resources and to footnote no 
of the consolidated financial statements 
environmental revenues decreased from  to  between and  this was the result of the company being able to acquire several large clients in and the subsequent completion of some of those contracts 
with the completion of these jobs  and a general downturn in the demand for environmental services  environmental revenues decreased by  or  from  in to  in this decrease was mainly due from reducing the size of the texas office 
environmental expenses decreased from  in to  in but did not decrease proportionately with the dramatic decrease in revenues 
the reason for this is the company s inability to decrease its trained staff without jeopardizing its ability to compete in the market 
between and the company was able to reduce costs by  or from  in to  in  this decrease was mainly due to decreases in staff in texas  utah  and cheyenne and the majority of the jobs being run from the casper office 
oil and gas sales declined slightly from  in to  in oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in or due to the drilling of three development wells in in the brundage canyon field 
oil and gas expenses decreased by  to  from to this decline reflects the company s acquisition of certain producing overriding royalties as compared to the bulk of the sales being from more expensive properties in prior years 
oil and gas expenses increased from  in to  in  a increase reflecting the additional wells drilled in the brundage canyon field 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was  in compared to  in  a increase 
this increase reflects the depreciation on the increased assets purchased in and depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from  in to  in  a increase due to the depletion and depreciation in the brundage canyon oil field 
general and administrative costs increased from  in to  in this increase in overhead costs reflects an increased number of staff from to general and administrative costs decreased by  from  in to  in  a decrease due to decreases in staff and other cost cutting efforts 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease was due to a declining borrowing base between the years 
interest expense increased in to  from  in  a increase due to additional outstanding loans 
interest income decreased from  in to  in to  in  a decrease in and a decrease in reflecting the utilization of investments for operations 
provision for income taxes reflect the amount of current income taxes payable 
no provision has been made for deferred taxes in   or management believes that although disclosures mandated by sfas no 
are generally informative  that in the company s case the application of sfas no 
leads to disclosures which are confusing 
to comply with sfas no 
is to record deferred income tax expense on the books of the company  when in fact  the company has  of net operating loss carryforwards   of depletion carryforwards and  of various income tax credits 
this issue is derived from the application of the provisions of sfas no 
to companies who have had quasi reorganizations in the past 
hawks industries applied the quasi reorganization provisions arb  effective in specifically  paragraphs and of sfas no 
require that in cases where there has been a quasi reorganization  that the tax benefits of loss carryforwards and credits  earned prior to the date of the quasi reorganization  be ignored when calculating deferred income tax benefits 
although management believes that such obscure provisions may give rise to great fodder in the world of academia  we believe that to apply the principles of sfas no 
 paragraphs and  is at variance with the economic realities of the present case 
accordingly  we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
 paragraphs and it is management s intent to attempt to reflect the economic reality of our present tax situation 
given all of the future tax benefits which will be available to the company to offset future net income  management believes that the financial statements presented have accomplished our goal
