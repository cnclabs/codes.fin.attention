during fiscal  the company sold seven engines as compared to fiscal  during which the company sold four engines

going forward  however  the company s lease revenues will be positively affected by the company s acquisition and lease of three aircraft during the fourth quarter of fiscal although the company was able to replace reduced sales to one large customer  the increase in parts sales was insufficient to offset the decrease in aircraft sales and lease revenues and  as a result  total revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal fiscal revenues were increased as a result of the settlement of certain disputes with a customer 
pursuant to the settlement  the customer paid the company  and the company canceled a note receivable from the customer

the company has continued to maintain approximately a valuation allowance against its existing deferred tax assets due to the company s previous financial problems and its relatively short history of profitability 
if the company remains profitable  and there can be no assurance of such profitability  the company expects to further reduce the allowance in the future 
the fiscal expense of  related to amendments of certain prior year state and federal tax returns 
net earnings before an extraordinary loss for fiscal were  or per share basic  compared to a net of  or per share basic  during fiscal on a diluted basis  earnings per share before an extraordinary item were and per share during fiscal and  respectively

the revolving credit facility matures in october and the term loans mature between march and october the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and availability of amounts for borrowing is subject to certain limitations and restrictions

the company believes that its working capital and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the company for the foreseeable future 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results  both on an annual and a quarterly basis  are affected by many factors  including the timing of large orders from customers  the timing of expenditures to purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales  the timing of bulk inventory purchases  the mix of available aircraft spare parts contained at any time in the company s inventory  the timing of aircraft or engine sales or leases  unanticipated aircraft or engine lease terminations  default by any lessees and many other factors largely outside the company s control 
since the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers  it must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of its customers and discussions with customers as to their future requirements 
cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  due to the value of a single aircraft or engine sale relative to the value of parts typically sold by the company  any concentration of aircraft or engine sales in a particular quarter may obscure existing or developing trends in the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
