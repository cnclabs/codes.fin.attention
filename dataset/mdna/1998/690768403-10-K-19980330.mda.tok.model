item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
the company is not a party to any material derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk an increasing portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary foreign markets served by the company s affiliates are in latin america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela and europe principally italy  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company s affiliates operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency operating profit generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profit generally increases 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to mitigate the economic effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on that portion of foreign currency operating profit which is expected to be remitted to the parent company or invested elsewhere 
the company s foreign affiliates generally invest their excess funds in us dollars or dollar based instru ments  where such instruments are available with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  however  this strategy exposes the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company believes that the benefit of investing excess cash in us dollars or their equivalent outweighs the risk of report ing losses or gains from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in those countries with hyper inflationary economies  where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  this investment strategy for excess funds mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains 
because most of the company s foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable 
consid erations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrow ings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
as of december   the portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in a foreign currency was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its foreign affiliates 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates  the company could  at its option  convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps
