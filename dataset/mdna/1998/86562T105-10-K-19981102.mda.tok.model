the company currently anticipates that all internally used software will be year compliant in a timely manner 
additionally  various machines and other types of personal property at each facility have computer controls and or contain integrated circuits that may be affected  and the company is in the process of identifying and analyzing such property to determine year compliance 
although  the company currently believes that it will be internally year compliant in all material respects prior to january  and that the effort to achieve year compliance has not and will not have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of future operations of the company  the company remains concerned that the failure to comply by a relatively small number of large customers and or vendors  including banking institutions  utilities  telecommunications and transportation companies  could significantly disrupt operations at one or more of the company s facilities 
summa does not have a formalized company wide contingency plan covering worst case scenarios in the event of year non compliance  but any such plan  if and when formalized  would likely include technical contacts  access to backup systems and alternative vendor sources  among other things
