the million outstanding under lines of credit at september  mature in fiscal year  however  the company expects that it will be able to renew those commitments upon maturity

the lines provide the company with various interest rate options generally at rates less than prime 
the company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit 
the company finances its expansion and renovation program primarily with cash provided from operations and from borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company typically replaces such financing  as necessary  with long term financing secured by equipment and real estate 
as of september   the company had unencumbered real property and equipment with a net book value of approximately million 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flow from operations  borrowings under its lines of credit and long term financing 
the company believes  based on its current results of operations and financial condition  that its financial resources  including existing bank lines of credit  short and long term financing expected to be available to it and internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including any debt service requirements of additional borrowings 
however  there can be no assurance that any such source of financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  it is possible that  in the future  the company s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this report based on a number of intangible factors 
these factors may include  among others  increased competition  changing regional and national economic conditions  adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery and changing demographics

the company pays these dividends at the discretion of the board of directors and the continuation of these payments  the amount of such dividends  and the form in which the dividends are paid cash or stock depends upon the results of operations  the financial condition of the company and other factors which the board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  certain loan agreements contain provisions restricting the ability of the company to pay dividends to approximately million at september  self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation and group medical and dental benefits

the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
the company carries casualty insurance only on those properties where it is required to do so 
the company believes that its mix between insurance and self insurance is prudent  is in accordance with general industry practice and is in the best interest of the company 
impact of inflation inflation in food prices during fiscal  and continued to be lower than the overall increase in the consumer price index

ingles began making changes to non compliant corporate programs in and expects to complete the process by december   with testing scheduled to be completed in early costs of testing and upgrading at the corporate level are immaterial and are expensed as incurred 
as a part of an overall technological upgrade at the store level to provide new and expanded functionality  ingles will be replacing equipment and software in its stores throughout the new store equipment will be year compliant 
the estimated cost of the new technology of approximately million will be capitalized as incurred and is included in the capital budget for fiscal in addition to replacing store technology  other expenditures will be required to make remaining hardware and software year compliant

if system failures do occur  the most significant impact anticipated could be the inability of the stores to process customer transactions  the inability of vendors to supply timely delivery of inventory or loss of electric power 
the company cannot ensure that there will be no material adverse impact on the company if third parties do not appropriately address the year issues 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year plan 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in march and determine whether such a plan is necessary
