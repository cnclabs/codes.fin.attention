the fixed interest rates under the interest rate swaps currently outstanding range from to per annum 
net payments under the agreements amounted to approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the swaps are of notional amounts and maturities that relate to specific portions of outstanding debt  and accordingly  are accounted for as hedge transactions

the interest rate protection agreements  foreign exchange options and foreign exchange forward contracts described above were the only derivative instruments held or entered into by the company at year end or during fiscal and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk exposures the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies and procedures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
to manage exposure to interest rate movements the company uses interest rate protection agreements 
based on the company s overall exposure to interest rate changes  a hypothetical change of basis points across all maturities of the company s floating rate debt obligations  after considering interest rate protection agreements  would be immaterial to the company s pre tax earnings in fiscal the company utilizes foreign currency denominated borrowings to selectively hedge its net investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries

a change in the relevant currency exchange rates is estimated to have an impact of million on the fair value of such borrowings 
this quantification of the company s exposure to the market risk of foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments is necessarily limited  as it does not take into account the offsetting impact of the company s underlying investment exposures 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations as well as its us businesses  which import or export goods 
the company has made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk 
foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of the company s foreign operations at september  is the local currency 
the operations in brazil operated in a hyperinflationary economy until on or about october   when brazil was no longer considered hyperinflationary 
during the hyperinflationary period  the functional currency of the company s operation in brazil was the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  while revenue  expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
except for companies operating in hyperinflationary economies  translation gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the company s operations in brazil of million are included in other income expense  net  in each of fiscal years and effect of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in the company s principal markets  inflation did not have a material impact on its results of operations in fiscal  or year readiness disclosure many computer systems and other equipment with embedded technology use only two digits to define the applicable year and may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities and operations the year issue 
the company is actively addressing the year issue 
the compliance program is led by information technology staff at each operating company  with assistance from manufacturing staff and outside technology consultants where necessary 
progress is being monitored by each operating company president and reported to usi management 
the company uses outside technology consultants to provide independent reviews of year readiness 
the company s year efforts focus on three areas information technology it related systems and processes  such as operating systems  applications and programs  embedded logic non it systems and processes  such as manufacturing machinery  telecommunications equipment and security devices  and compliance efforts of third parties such as customers  suppliers and service providers 
within each of the it and non it areas  the project spans four phases assessment of programs and devices to identify those that are affected by the year issue  development of remediation strategies  testing such strategies  and implementing the solutions 
the third party aspect of the project involves contacting significant third parties to obtain information about their year compliance in order to determine and mitigate the risk to the company for third parties failures 
the company has completed an assessment of its critical it systems and  as a result  the operating companies have decided to modify  upgrade or replace portions of their systems 
the remediation efforts achieved significant progress in fiscal and  and remain underway 
the company expects that the remediation  testing and implementation of all critical it systems will be completed at dates ranging from january to september the company is continuing the process of assessing and remediating critical non it systems  as well  and expects that the assessment  remediation  testing and implementation of such systems will be completed by the fourth quarter of calendar year year costs for computer equipment  software and outside consultants incurred through september  are approximately million  of which million was expensed and million was capitalized 
estimated future costs to complete the year program are million  of which million are expected to be expensed as incurred and the remaining million are expected to be capitalized 
these costs have been  and will continue to be  funded from operating cash flow and available credit facilities 
most of the costs are for new systems and improved functionality 
these costs exclude internal costs  principally related to payroll costs for its employees who are involved in the year program  which are not separately tracked by the company 
the company is developing contingency plans to address the possibility of failure by the company or third parties to complete their year initiatives on a timely basis 
the company expects that preliminary plans will be in place by march  with further refinements anticipated through the end of based on the company s ongoing evaluation of its readiness as well as the status of compliance of third parties 
such contingency plans may include using alternative processes  such as manual procedures to substitute for non compliant systems  arranging for alternate suppliers and service providers  increasing inventory levels  and developing procedures internally and in conjunction with significant third parties to address compliance issues as they arise 
no amount of preparation and testing can guarantee year compliance 
however  the company believes it is taking appropriate preventive measures and will be successful in avoiding any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  the company recognizes that failing to resolve its year issues on a timely basis would  in a worst case scenario  significantly limit its ability to manufacture and distribute its products and process its daily business transactions for a period of time  especially if such failure is coupled with third party or infrastructure failures 
similarly  the company could be significantly affected by the failure of one or more significant suppliers  customers or components of the infrastructure to conduct their respective operations without interruption after because of the difficulty of assessing the year compliance of such third parties  the company considers the potential disruptions caused by such parties to present the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
adverse effects on the company could include business disruption  increased costs  loss of sales and other similar ramifications 
the costs of the company s year initiatives  the dates on which the company believes that it will complete such activities and the company s evaluation of third party effects are estimates and subject to change 
actual results could differ from those currently anticipated 
factors that could cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of key year personnel  the company s ability to respond to unforeseen year complications  the readiness of third parties  the accuracy of third party assurances regarding year compliance and similar uncertainties 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and a single european currency the euro 
during a transition period from january  through december   legacy currencies will continue in use  however  the value of such currencies will be set at fixed and irrevocable conversion rates to the euro 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued and the legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company is addressing issues raised by the conversion to the euro  such as assessing whether cross border price transparency will limit the company s flexibility to charge different prices for similar products and adapting its information technology systems 
the company s efforts to adapt its systems differ at its various european operations 
some operations are expected to be able to accommodate euro denominated invoicing and purchasing transactions by january  the company s significant european operations have formulated plans to accommodate all euro denominated transactions and conversion conventions by january  the company anticipates that its costs in connection with the euro conversion will not be material 
the company does not anticipate that the conversion from the legacy currencies to the euro would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
outlook the company believes that  based on initial forecasts for fiscal and subject to the factors described above under disclosures concerning forward looking statements  it should achieve earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of to 
management expects that earnings for fiscal will be more heavily weighted towards the third and fourth fiscal quarters than it was in fiscal and the re distribution reflects the increased share of the company s sales and profits derived from its plumbing and lighting businesses  which record higher activity in the spring and summer due to the seasonal nature of the construction industry 
also  weaker comparisons during the first and second fiscal quarters at usi diversified and usi hardware and tools will impact the overall distribution of earnings during fiscal item a
