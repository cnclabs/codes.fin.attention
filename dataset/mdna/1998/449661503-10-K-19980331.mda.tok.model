cost of vacation ownership interests sold as a percentage of vacation ownership interest sales decreased from in to in due to an increase in the number of biennial sales 
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of vacation ownership interests sales increased from in to in due to a promotional program in which offered certain purchasers of vacation ownership interests a vacation experience including accommodations  airfare and car rental 
while the cost of the vacation experience was added to the purchase price  it had the effect of increasing sales and marketing costs as a percentage of sales of vacation ownership interests 
additionally  included the recognition of  of revenue recognized on the percentage of completion method but for which marketing costs were recognized in when incurred 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of sales of vacation ownership interests from in to in reflects the expected performance of the portfolio of consumer paper based on the company s collection experience in the prior years  both sold and unsold 
the decrease in cost of resort operations as a percentage of resort operating revenue to in from in reflects lower costs of operations at los abrigados as a percentage of revenue due to increased occupancy  increased ilx owner rates and reductions in operating costs  net of the costs of operations for vca south bend and kohl s ranch  which began operations in and accordingly had lower occupancy than mature resorts

proceeds from the failed offering were intended for varsity clubs expansion  however  as a result of abandoning the bond offering  the company canceled its options on certain varsity clubs sites  and  of related costs were written off because the company no longer expected to build at these sites within the option periods 
the increase in interest expense from million in to million in reflects an increase in notes payable  including the note payable for the construction of vca south bend  which interest had been capitalized through completion in august  the acquisition notes for kohl s ranch  lomacasi cottages and the inn at los abrigados  and increased borrowings against consumer notes receivable 
income tax expense increased from a benefit in to a provision in because included a reduction in the valuation allowance  reflecting management s estimate of the future benefit to be derived from the utilization of genesis nol carryovers  and also a result of increased net income in minority interests are comparable between years

for  the minority interests include the minority interest ownership of the genesis land parcels sold in liquidity and capital resources sources of cash the company generates cash primarily from the sale of vacation ownership interests including upgrades  the financing of customer notes from such sales and resort operations 
during  and  cash provided by used in operations was million  million  and million  respectively 
the negative cash flow in was due primarily to an increase in resort property held for timeshare sales of million resulting from the completion of construction and opening of vca south bend  which was financed primarily through borrowings of million in because the company uses significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation ownership interests  but collects the cash on the customer notes receivable over a long period of time  borrowing against and or selling receivables is a necessary part of its normal operations 
for regular federal income tax purposes  the company reports substantially all of its non factored financed vacation ownership interest sales under the installment method 
under the installment method  the company recognizes income on sales of vacation ownership interests only when cash is received by the company in the form of a down payment  as installment payments or from proceeds from the sale of the customer note 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest may be imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method  as the interest expense is not estimable 
at december   the company  excluding genesis  had nol carryforwards of million  which expire in through at december   genesis had federal nol carryforwards of million  which are limited as to usage  because they arise from built in losses of an acquired company 
in addition  such losses can only be utilized through the earnings of genesis and are limited to a maximum of  per year 
to the extent the entire  is not utilized in a given year  the difference may be carried forward to future years 
any unused genesis nols will expire in in addition  section of the code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nol s by a corporation following various types of ownership changes which result in more than a change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
such changes may result from new common stock issuances by the company or changes occurring as a result of filings with the securities and exchange commission of schedules d and g by holders of more than of the common stock  whether involving the acquisition or disposition of common stock 
if such a subsequent change occurs  the limitations of section would apply and may limit or deny the future utilization of the nol by the company  which could result in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of cash investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash because of capital additions and loans to customers in connection with the company s vacation ownership interest sales 
net cash used in investing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to  due to the company s purchase of the minority interest in lap see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which included a cash payment of approximately  and due to the company s strategy of hypothecating its customer notes rather than selling them 
the company requires funds to finance the acquisitions of property for future resort development and to further develop the existing resorts  as well as to make capital improvements and support current operations 
the company is currently constructing vca tucson  arizona at an aggregate estimated cost of million 
construction of the facility commenced in and is expected to be completed in april the company has a commitment for construction financing in the amount of million  which is expected to be sufficient to build and furnish the property 
at december   million had been drawn against this commitment 
customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivables in that notes which are more than to days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company in effect must repay borrowings against such notes or buy back such notes if they were sold with recourse 
credit facilities the company has agreements with financial institutions for total commitments aggregating million under which the company may sell certain of its customer notes 
these agreements provide for sales on a recourse basis with a percentage of the amount sold held back by the financial institution as additional collateral 
notes may be sold at discounts or premiums to yield the consumer market rate as defined by the financial institution 
at december   approximately million was available under these commitments 
the company also has financing commitments aggregating million whereby the company may borrow against notes receivable pledged as collateral 
these borrowings bear interest at a rate of prime plus to prime plus and expire at various dates from through at december   approximately million is available under these commitments 
in the future  the company may negotiate additional credit facilities  issue corporate debt  issue equity securities  or any combination of the above 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  may bear interest at fixed or variable rates of interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional corporate debt or equity at or beyond current levels or that the company will be able to maintain its current level of debt 
the company believes available borrowing capacity  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity  operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
seasonality the company s revenues are moderately seasonal with the volume of ilx owners  hotel guests and vacation ownership interest exchange participants typically greatest in the second and third fiscal quarters 
as the company expands into new markets and geographic locations it may experience increased or additional seasonality dynamics which may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate 
year issues as with other organizations  some of the company s computer programs were originally designed to recognize calendar years by their last two digits 
calculations performed using these truncated fields would not work properly with dates from the year and beyond 
the company has initiated efforts to remedy this situation and expects all programs to be corrected and tested prior to the year the incremental costs of this project are not expected to have a material effect of the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenues  operating income and net income during any of the company s three most recent fiscal years 
however  to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the rates the company charges on its customer notes
