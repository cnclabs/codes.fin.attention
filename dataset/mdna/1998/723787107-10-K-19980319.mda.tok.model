item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the formation of pioneer pioneer natural resources company the company  a delaware corporation  was formed by the merger of parker parsley petroleum company parker parsley and mesa inc mesa on august  the company was significantly expanded by the subsequent acquisition of the canadian and argentine oil and gas business of chauvco resources ltd 
chauvco  a publicly traded independent oil and gas company based in calgary  canada on december  the company is an oil and gas exploration and production company with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located principally in the midcontinent  southwestern and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of the united states and in argentina and canada 
combining the physical assets and management teams of parker parsley and mesa into the company created a company with a solid foundation of core assets 
this foundation includes three core areas the hugoton gas field located in southwest kansas  the west panhandle gas field located in the texas panhandle  and the spraberry oil and gas field in west texas that provide consistent and dependable production  cash flow and ongoing development opportunities  a reserve portfolio which is balanced between oil and natural gas liquids and gas  a portfolio of exciting exploration opportunities  and a team of dedicated employees representing the professional disciplines and sciences which will allow the company to continue to provide its shareholders with superior long term value 
the company s first significant accomplishment after the merger was the acquisition of chauvco 
the chauvco acquisition provided the company with mmboe and mmboe of proved reserves in argentina and canada  respectively  and a substantial inventory of unproved oil and gas properties which will provide the company with many exploration opportunities with the potential for significant reserve additions 
although the acquisition of the portfolio of unproved properties from chauvco represents an exciting challenge to the company s team of engineers  geologists and geophysicists  such opportunities are not without risk 
us gaap requires periodic evaluations of these costs on a project by project basis in comparison to their estimated value 
these evaluations will be affected by results of exploration activities  future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects 
if the quantity of proved reserves determined by such evaluations are not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project  the company may be required to recognize significant noncash charges to the earnings of future periods 
there can be no assurance that economic reserves will be determined to exist for such projects 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board no 
 business combinations  both the merger with mesa and the acquisition of chauvco have been accounted for as purchases by the company formerly parker parsley 
as a result  the historical financial statements for the company are those of parker parsley  and the company s financial statements present the addition of mesa s and chauvco s assets and liabilities as an acquisition by the company in august and december  respectively 
specifically  the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include the financial results of mesa beginning in august the aggregate purchase consideration related to the assets and liabilities of mesa and chauvco  including transaction costs  was million and million  respectively 
financial performance the company reported a net loss of million per share as compared to net income of million per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss is primarily generated by a noncash charge of billion million after tax in december of  resulting from an impairment charge taken in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
in addition to the above  the process of organizationally  operationally and financially combining parker parsley and mesa to create the company resulted in the following pre tax charges the redemption of two issuances of senior notes at a loss of million  million of relocation expenses and million of severance expenses  and a million write off of commitment fees related to parker parsley s credit facility that was replaced with a new billion credit agreement for the company during as discussed more fully in results of operations below  the company s financial performance during has been positively affected by increases in oil and gas production and decreases in production costs per boe due to ongoing cost reduction efforts  offset by decreases in commodity prices  increases in exploration and general and administrative expenses and an increase in interest expense due to the additional debt assumed from mesa 
the year ended december  includes million per share related to net after tax gains on asset dispositions primarily due to the sale of the company s australasian subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was comparable to million for the year ended december  the additional cash flow generated by increased production was offset by increased general and administrative expenses and interest expense and the payment of certain liabilities assumed from mesa 
long term debt has increased to billion at december  from million at december  due principally to the assumption of the outstanding debt of mesa and chauvco and the property acquisitions described below 
the company strives to maintain its outstanding indebtedness at a moderate level in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility for future opportunities 
the company s total book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of total long term debt of billion and stockholders equity of billion 
consequently  the company s long term debt to total capitalization increased to at december  from at december  outlook during  the company plans to accelerate its portfolio management initiatives through a major divestiture program focused on improving operating efficiency and profitability 
approximately of the company s domestic fields generate only of the company s total cash flow 
the company plans to sell these nonstrategic fields for estimated proceeds of to million during the latter part of the proceeds will be used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness and to fund the company s capital expenditures program 
this will leave the company with approximately fields  which represent its core producing assets and complementary development and exploration opportunities 
the consummation of the company s divestiture plans is entirely dependent on finding one or more willing buyers who have the financial wherewithal to complete such a purchase 
until such a buyer is found  the company may reevaluate its portfolio of properties and at any time may adjust its plans concerning divestitures 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the divestiture of any or all of these properties will be completed or that the estimated proceeds will be realized 
coincidentally with the property divestiture program  the company has announced its intentions to reorganize its operations to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by the concentration of reserves in a small number of fields 
the company will combine the six domestic regions created by the merger between parker parsley and mesa into three geographic regions the permian basin region  the midcontinent region and the onshore and offshore gulf coast region 
the company anticipates that it will incur nonrecurring expenditures of approximately million during as a result of this reorganization 
during  the company will continue its emphasis on core development  exploration and production activities  with a primary focus on the exploitation of its current portfolio of drilling locations 
this portfolio was significantly enhanced and expanded by the major acquisitions completed in in addition  the and drilling programs have added a large number of new locations to which proved reserves have been assigned 
the company believes that its current portfolio of undeveloped prospects provides attractive development and exploration opportunities for at least the next three to five years 
the company expects to invest million in capital projects during of the total capital expenditure budget of million  the company has allocated million to exploitation activities  million to exploration activities and million to oil and gas property acquisitions 
the company anticipates that the million exploration and development budget will be spent geographically as follows million in the permian basin  million in the onshore and offshore gulf coast  million in the midcontinent  million in canada  million in argentina and million in africa and other international areas 
this capital expenditure budget reflects the company s plan to drill approximately oil and gas wells 
the company currently expects to fund its capital expenditure budget primarily with internally generated cash flow and the proceeds from the oil and gas property divestiture program 
this budget reflects the company s ongoing strategy to commit a greater portion of its cash flow to higher growth potential projects  including significant d seismic projects 
historically  mesa and parker parsley had each spent a small percentage of its respective capital on exploration projects 
the company now expects to spend approximately of its exploration exploitation capital budget on exploration 
during most of and  the company benefitted from higher oil prices as compared to previous years 
however  during the fourth quarter of  oil prices began a downward trend that has continued into march a continuation of the oil price environment experienced during the first quarter of will have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating cash flow  and may result in a downward adjustment to the company s current capital budget of million 
also  a continuing decline in oil prices could result in additional decreases in the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the forward looking statements in these projections  including statements relating to capital budget  production  cash flows and drilling activities  are based upon a number of assumptions  including among others  limited changes in oil and gas prices and the accuracy of reserve engineering studies 
these assumptions may prove not to have been accurate 
significant activities in property acquisition activities cotton valley 
in may of  the company acquired a interest in approximately  gross acres within the cotton valley pinnacle reef trend from union pacific resources company uprc for million 
the company and uprc have signed an exploration agreement to jointly explore and develop this area located in eastern texas and plan to begin drilling the first exploration well before the end of the year 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of assets in the east texas basin from american cometra  inc aci and rockland pipe co 
rockland  both subsidiaries of electrafina sa of belgium 
the total consideration paid was approximately million  consisting of million in cash and million shares of the company s common stock 
the company acquired all of aci s producing wells  acreage  gross and  net  seismic data  royalties and mineral interests and rockland s gathering system  pipeline and plum creek gas processing plant in the east texas basin 
the acquired acreage is in henderson  freestone  anderson and leon counties 
the acquired wells are currently producing approximately mmcf per day and have significant future drilling opportunities 
maude traylor 
in february of  the company completed the acquisition of a majority interest in the maude traylor field in calhoun county  texas for approximately million 
this acquisition represented an average working interest of in approximately  acres and five wells which produce from the upper and lower frio formations 
guatemala 
during may of  the company finalized negotiations with triton energy for a working interest in a joint exploration program of two blocks in guatemala s south peten basin 
drilling on the piedras blancas resulted in an unsuccessful exploratory well at a total cost to the company of million 
exploration and development activities drilling activities 
excluding the merger with mesa and the acquisition of chauvco  the company s capital expenditures totaled million reflecting expenditures of million for exploitation activities  million for exploration activities and million for oil and gas property acquisitions in the company s core areas 
during  the company participated in the completion of gross exploration and development wells  wells in the permian region  wells in the gulf coast region  wells in the midcontinent region  six wells in argentina and one well in guatemala 
of these wells  were in progress at december  of the total wells completed during the year ended december   wells were completed successfully which resulted in an success rate 
in addition to the wells completed during  the company had wells in progress at december  proved reserves 
the company s proved reserves totaled million boe at december   million boe at december  and million boe at december  the company achieved these annual increases in reserves despite having sold reserves of million boe in  million boe in and million boe in oil and ngl reserves at year end were million bbls compared to million bbls at year end and million bbls at year end a increase from to and an increase from to 
natural gas reserves at year end were  bcf  compared to bcf at year end and bcf at year end a increase from to and an decrease from to 
reserve replacement 
for the ninth consecutive year  the company was able to replace its annual production volumes with proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas  stated on an energy equivalent basis 
during  the company added million boe resulting in reserve replacement of of total production 
of the million boe reserve additions  million boe were added through acquisitions of proved properties  million boe were added through exploration and development drilling activities and million boe were the net result of revisions 
reserves added by development drilling are primarily from the identification of additional infill drilling locations and new secondary recovery projects 
reserve revisions result from several factors including changes in existing estimates of quantities available for production and changes in estimates of quantities which are economical to produce under current pricing conditions 
the company s reserves as of december  were estimated using a price of per bbl for oil  per bbl of ngls and per mcf of gas 
should prices decline in future periods  reserves may be revised downward for quantities which may be uneconomical to produce at lower prices 
the company s reserve replacement rate on a boe basis was  which included reserve replacement rates for oil and natural gas of and  respectively 
previous reserve replacement performance rates were in for oil and for gas and in for oil and for gas 
for the three and five year periods ended december   the three and five year average reserve replacement rates were and  respectively 
finding cost 
the company s acquisition and finding cost for was per boe as compared to the and acquisition and finding costs of and per boe  respectively 
the increased rate in is a result of the fair value assigned to mesa s long lived  low cost reserves 
the average acquisition and finding cost for the three year period from to was per boe representing a increase from the three year average rate of 
unproved properties 
although the acquisition of the portfolio of unproved properties from chauvco represents an exciting challenge to the company s team of engineers  geologists and geophysicists  such opportunities are not without risk 
us gaap requires periodic evaluations of these costs on a project by project basis in comparison to their estimated value 
these evaluations will be affected by results of exploration activities  future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects 
if the quantities of proved reserves determined by such evaluations are not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project  the company may be required to recognize significant noncash charges to the earnings of future periods 
there can be no assurance that economic reserves will be determined to exist for such projects 
other events asset dispositions 
from time to time  the company disposes of nonstrategic assets in order to raise capital for other activities  reduce debt or eliminate costs associated with nonstrategic assets 
for the year ended december   the company s asset disposition activity primarily consisted of the sale of certain domestic assets  primarily oil and gas properties  for proceeds of million  which resulted in a pre tax net gain of million  and the sale of the company s subsidiary with an ownership interest in oil and gas properties in turkey for proceeds of million  which resulted in the recognition of a pre tax gain of thousand 
during the year ended december   the company sold certain wholly owned australasian subsidiaries for proceeds of million resulting in a pre tax gain of million and certain nonstrategic domestic assets for proceeds of million that resulted in the recognition of a pre tax net gain of million 
the proceeds from the asset dispositions were initially used to reduce the company s outstanding bank indebtedness and subsequently to provide funding for a portion of the company s capital expenditures  including purchases of oil and gas properties in the company s core areas 
during  the company anticipates selling certain nonstrategic domestic oil and gas properties for approximately to million 
conversion of subsidiary preferred shares to common stock 
on july   the company exercised its right to require each holder of its cumulative guaranteed monthly income convertible preferred shares preferred shares to exchange all preferred shares for shares of common stock of the company see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
on july   the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for the  preferred shares outstanding 
as a result  the company will no longer incur interest expense associated with the preferred shares of approximately million per year 
information systems for the year the company will be required to modify its information systems in order to accurately process data referencing the year because of the importance of occurrence dates in the oil and gas industry  the consequences of not pursuing these modifications could be very significant to the company s ability to manage and report operating activities 
currently  the company plans to contract with third parties to perform the software programming changes necessary to correct any existing deficiencies 
the company currently believes the total cost to make the necessary software program modifications will be approximately million 
such programming changes are anticipated to be completed and tested by march  reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
reporting comprehensive income sfas which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
specifically  sfas requires that an enterprise i classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and ii display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  comprehensive income consists of the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources 
specifically  this includes net income and other comprehensive income  which is made up of certain changes in assets and liabilities that are not reported in a statement of operations but are included in the balances within a separate component of equity in a statement of financial position 
such changes include  but are not limited to  unrealized gains for marketable securities and future contracts  foreign currency translation adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustments 
segment reporting 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas which establishes standards for public business enterprises for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that such enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
this statement also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
sfas is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company operates in the one product line oil and gas production in limited geographic areas 
the geographic information and information about major customers is disclosed in the company s annual financial statements

total production costs per boe depletion per boe oil and gas revenues 
revenues from oil and gas operations totaled million in  million in and million in  representing a increase from to and a increase from to the increase from to is primarily attributable to increases in oil and gas production  offset by declines in commodity prices 
the majority of the increased production is a direct result of the oil and gas properties acquired from mesa 
parker parsley historically accounted for processed natural gas production as wellhead production on a wet gas basis while mesa accounted for processed natural gas production in two components natural gas liquids and dry residue gas 
the combined entities own three major gas processing facilities  and the majority of the gas processed by these facilities is owned by the company and produced by company operated properties 
consequently  the company now produces a higher proportion of processed gas relative to total natural gas production and will account for natural gas production as processed natural gas liquids and dry residue gas 
separate product volumes will not be comparable for periods prior to september  on a boe basis  production increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the additional production volumes from the mesa properties contributed of production growth from to the remainder of the increases are a direct result of the successes of the company s exploration and exploitation efforts 
such production growth becomes particularly evident in light of the fact that a portion of the average daily oil and gas production for related to properties included in the sale of the company s australasian subsidiaries and the sale of certain nonstrategic domestic assets 
excluding production associated with assets sold during and the mesa properties acquired in  on a boe basis  production increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended the increase in oil and gas revenues from to is primarily attributable to the higher average prices being received for both oil and gas production and increases in production due to the company s successful exploitation and exploration activities in and  offset by the decreased production resulting from the sale of the company s australasian assets and the and sales of certain domestic assets 
the average oil price received for the year ended december  decreased from in to in  and the average gas price received decreased from in to in 
during  the company received an average of per bbl for ngls 
the average oil price received for the year ended december  increased from in to in  while the average gas price received increased from in to in 
hedging activities the oil and gas prices that the company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the company s hedging activities 
the company utilizes commodity derivative contracts swaps  futures and options in order to i reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities the company produces and sells  ii support the company s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii lock in prices to protect the economics related to certain capital projects 
crude oil 
all material purchase contracts governing the company s oil production are tied directly or indirectly to nymex prices 
the average oil price per bbl that the company reports includes the effects of oil quality  gathering and transportation costs and the net effect of the oil hedges 
the company s average realized price for physical oil sales excluding hedge results for the years ended december   and was per bbl  per bbl and per bbl  respectively 
the company recorded net reductions to oil revenues of million  million and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of its oil price hedges 
natural gas liquids 
the company employs a policy of hedging natural gas liquids based on actual product prices in order to mitigate some of the volatility associated with nymex pricing 
natural gas liquids are sold under long term contracts which provide price flexibility and allow the company to maximize prices between trading hubs 
during the year ended december   the company realized an average natural gas liquids price for physical sales excluding hedge results of per bbl and recorded a net decrease to natural gas liquids revenue of  natural gas 
the company employs a policy of hedging gas production based on the index price upon which the gas is actually sold in order to mitigate the basis risk between nymex prices and actual index prices 
the average gas price per mcf that the company reports includes the effects of btu content  gathering and transportation costs  gas processing and shrinkage and the net effect of the gas hedges 
the company s average realized price for physical gas sales excluding hedge results for the years ended december   and was per mcf  per mcf and per mcf  respectively 
the company recorded net reductions to gas revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and an increase to gas revenues of million during  as a result of its gas price hedges 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for information concerning the company s open hedge positions at december  and the related prices to be realized 
production costs 
total production costs per boe decreased in and by approximately and  respectively from in to in to in 
the primary component of production costs  lease operating expense  has also decreased significantly  in and in these costs represent the majority of the oil and gas property operating expenses over which the company has control and the costs on which the company has focused its reduction efforts 
as discussed more fully in natural gas processing below  the company has adopted a new method of reporting the financial results of its natural gas processing facilities and is now presenting these results as oil and gas production activities 
in  the operating margin from the company s gas plants ie  third party processing revenues less processing costs and expenses is included in oil and gas production costs  specifically lease operating expense  which resulted in a decrease in lease operating expense per boe of 
for the year ended december   as compared to the additional reductions in lease operating expense during the three years ended december  are primarily due to the company s concentrated efforts to evaluate and reduce all operating costs and the sale of certain high operating cost properties during depletion expense 
depletion expense per boe increased in to in from in and decreased in from in 
the increase in depletion expense per boe in is primarily associated with the fair value allocated to mesa s long lived  low production cost natural gas reserves 
the decrease in depletion expense per boe in is primarily the result of the following factors i the significant increase in oil and gas reserves during and resulting from the company s exploration and development drilling activities  including revisions  and ii a reduction in the company s net depletable basis from charges taken in in accordance with sfas see impairment of oil and gas properties below 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of the company s assets 
historically  a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties has been the result of depressed commodity prices 
the company recognized noncash pre tax charges of billion million after tax and million million after tax related to its oil and gas properties during and  respectively 
see note b and note m of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for further explanation of the company s policies concerning sfas and its and charges for impairment 
exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs 
exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily the result of increased domestic exploratory drilling and geological and geophysical activity due to the expansion of the company s exploration program 
the decrease in is largely the result of decreased activity  both in exploratory drilling and geological and geophysical activity  resulting from the sale in march of the company s australasian assets see asset dispositions above and note l of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  offset by increases in geological and geophysical activity in the united states as a result of the company s increased focus on exploitation and exploration activities 
the following table sets forth the components of the company s  and exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs year ended december  in thousands exploratory dry holes united states    australia and other foreign    geological and geophysical costs united states    foreign    leasehold abandonments and other    approximately of the company s exploration exploitation capital budget will be spent on exploratory projects compared to in and in 
the company currently anticipates that its exploration efforts will be concentrated domestically in the gulf coast region and internationally in argentina  canada and africa 
the company continues to review opportunities involving exploration joint ventures in domestic and international areas outside the company s existing core operating areas 
natural gas processing the company historically reflected its ownership interests in and revenues and expenses related to its natural gas processing facilities as separate items in the consolidated financial statements while mesa reported revenues and expenses from its natural gas processing facilities as oil and gas production costs 
during the last four years  the company has sold its interests in natural gas processing facilities and now owns interests in seven facilities 
the ownership interest in the remaining gas plant facilities and the related results of operations from third party gas processed through such facilities are not material to the company s financial position 
to report the results of gas processing activities consistently within the financial statements  during  the company reclassified the natural gas processing facilities into oil and gas properties for financial statement purposes and will report all third party revenues and expenses from its natural gas processing facilities in oil and gas production costs 
natural gas processing revenues were million in and million in  and natural gas processing costs were million in and million in the natural gas processing revenues and costs decreased and  respectively  when compared to the amounts primarily due to the sale of four gas plants during and the sale of one gas plant during the average price per bbl of ngls increased in from in to in  while the average price per mcf of residue gas increased in from in to in 
during january  the company realized proceeds of million from sales of gas plants and related assets which resulted in the company recognizing a net pre tax gain of thousand 
in addition  in october  the company sold its interests in the cargray and schafer plants located in carson county  texas 
the company received net proceeds of million from the disposition of such plants which resulted in the company recognizing a net pre tax gain of million 
during  the company recognized noncash pre tax charges of million related to abandonments of certain of the company s gas processing facilities and the cancellation of certain gas processing contracts 
additionally  during  the company recognized a noncash pre tax impairment charge of thousand related to a natural gas processing facility 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in  representing a increase from to and a decrease from to the increase from to resulted from the increased size of the company and reorganization and relocation costs caused by the merger between parker parsley and mesa and the acquisition of chauvco 
the decrease from to is primarily due to including pre tax charges of million associated with the amortization of deferred compensation awarded in and organizational changes implemented by the company that were designed to reduce overall general and administrative expenses 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase from to is primarily the result of an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance of the company s indebtedness during as compared to due to the additional debt assumed from mesa 
the decrease from to is due to a decrease of million in the weighted average outstanding balance of the company s indebtedness for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   resulting primarily from the application of proceeds from the sale of the company s australasian assets and the sales of certain domestic assets during and  and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on the company s indebtedness from in to in in addition  the  and amounts include million  million and million of interest  respectively  associated with the preferred stock of the company s subsidiary  parker parsley capital llc  which was converted to common stock of the company in july see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the  and amounts also include million  million and million  respectively  of amortization of capitalized loan fees 
during each of the years  and  the company was a party to various interest rate swap agreements 
as a result  the company recorded a reduction in interest expense of thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively  and additional interest expense of thousand for the year ended december  for a description of the company s interest rate swap agreements  see note j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
other expense during  mesa entered into btu swap agreements covering  mmbtu per day from january  through december  under the terms of these agreements  the company will receive a premium of 
per mmbtu over market natural gas prices from january  through december  following this two year period  the company will receive of the nymex oil price for the volumes covered for a six year period beginning january  and ending december  as these derivative contracts do not qualify as hedges  the company recorded a million noncash pre tax mark to market adjustment to the carrying value of the btu swap agreements in these contracts will continue to be marked to market at the end of each reporting period during their respective lives and the effects on the company s results of operations in future periods could be significant 
income taxes the company s income tax benefit of million and million for and  respectively both of which exclude the tax effects related to extraordinary items  and its income tax provision of million for reflect the net provision or benefit  resulting from the separate tax calculation prepared for each tax jurisdiction in which the company is subject to income taxes 
for  and the company had effective total tax rates of approximately  and  respectively 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the company s income tax provision and benefits 
extraordinary items on december   the company completed a cash tender offer for a significant portion of the senior subordinated discount notes due and the senior subordinated notes due the notes collectively  the subordinated notes assumed from mesa for a redemption price of and  respectively  per  tendered plus any interest accrued on the notes the tender offer 
as a result of the tender offer  the company recognized an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million net of a related tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter of the company financed the purchase price of the subordinated notes tendered in the offer with borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  also includes a million net of a related tax benefit of thousand noncash charge for an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from the mergers 
this extraordinary loss relates to capitalized issuance fees associated with parker parsley s previously existing bank credit facility which was replaced by the new credit facility agreement for the company 
in october  the company transferred cash and certain oil and gas properties with an aggregate estimated value of million in full satisfaction of a non recourse note secured by the properties  the balance of which was approximately million 
as a result  the company recognized an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million net of related tax expense of million 
capital commitments  capital resources and liquidity capital commitments 
the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and working capital obligations 
the company s cash expenditures during  and for additions to oil and gas properties including individual property acquisitions  but not including company acquisitions totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the amount includes million for development and exploratory drilling and  as in and  the company s drilling activities were focused primarily in the spraberry field of the permian basin 
significant drilling expenditures in included million in the unitized portion of the spraberry field of the permian basin including million in the driver unit  million in the preston unit  million in the shackelford unit  million in the north pembrook unit and million in the merchant unit  million in other portions of the spraberry field  million in other areas of the permian basin  million in the onshore and offshore gulf coast region  million in the midcontinent region and million in argentina and guatemala 
the company s capital expenditure budget has been set at million  reflecting planned expenditures of million for exploitation activities  million for exploration activities and million for oil and gas property acquisitions in the company s core areas 
the company budgets it capital expenditures based on projected internally generated cash flows and routinely adjusts the level of its capital expenditures in response to anticipated changes in cash flows 
funding for the company s working capital obligations is provided by internally generated cash flow 
funding for the repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and the company s capital expenditure program may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow  proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in capital resources below 
capital resources 
the company s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets 
the company expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during of million was comparable to that of of million 
the additional cash flow generated by increased production was offset by increased general and administrative expenses and interest expenses and the payment of certain liabilities assumed from mesa  including severance payments made to former mesa employees 
during  net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in 
this increase during is primarily attributable to stronger oil and gas prices combined with declining production costs due to improvements in the company s overall cost structure in and financing activities as described more fully in note e of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  on august   the company entered into two credit facility agreements with a syndicate of banks which provide for a total domestic bank credit facility of billion 
the company had an outstanding balance under its bank facility at december  of billion including outstanding  undrawn letters of credit of million  leaving approximately thousand of unused borrowing base immediately available 
at december   the company also had million outstanding under its canadian credit facility leaving a borrowing capacity of million
