reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from  at march  to  at march  reserves have been charged for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods 
management believes these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances 
during fiscal the company invested approximately  primarily in computer hardware and software purchases required to support the company s development efforts  management information systems and expenditures related to new facilities in europe and canada 
in connection with the company s purchases of sony products to be distributed in japan  sony of japan requires cash deposits totaling one third of purchase orders 
additionally  nintendo of japan requires cash deposits on all orders of n cartridge products 
electronic arts  kk eaj utilizes lines of credit to fund these deposits for purchases of sony and nintendo products and for other operating requirements 
at march   eaj had lines of credit of approximately  of which  was outstanding 
the company s principal source of liquidity is  in cash and short term investments 
management believes the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is complex and pervasive as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with which the company deals on financial transactions worldwide 
failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to conduct business 
for example  a significant percentage of purchase orders received from the company s customers are computer generated and electronically transmitted 
a failure of the computer systems of the company s customers to be year compliant could significantly impact the orders received by the company from such customer 
the company s financial information systems include an oracle system in the united states and europe  which the company believes to be year compliant 
the company is analyzing its remaining computer systems to identify any potential year issues and will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
management has not yet determined the cost related to achieving year compliance 
in addition  the year could affect the ability of consumers to use the pc based products sold by the company 
if the computer systems on which the consumers use the company s products are not year compliant  such noncompliance could affect the consumers ability to use such products 
factors affecting future performance future operating results of the company depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect the company s operating results are as follows the industry and competition 
the interactive software business has historically been a volatile and highly dynamic industry affected by changing technology  limited hardware platform life cycles  hit products  competition  component supplies  seasonality  consumer spending and other economic trends 
the business is also intensely competitive 
a variety of companies offer products that compete directly with one or more of the company s products 
these direct competitors vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial  managerial and technical resources comparable to or greater than those of the company 
typically  the company s chief competitor on dedicated game platforms is the hardware manufacturer licensor itself  to which the company must pay royalties  and in the case of sony and nintendo  manufacturing charges 
for example  sony has aggressively launched sports product lines that directly compete with the company s sports products on the playstation 
in addition  competition for creative talent has intensified  and the attraction and retention of key personnel by the company is increasingly difficult 
products 
interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans of only to months 
in addition  the packaged goods market is crowded with a large number of titles competing for limited retail shelf space 
the company s future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce new competitive products on a timely basis and  in the packaged goods market  to get those products distributed widely at retail 
to compete successfully  new products must adapt to new hardware platforms and emerging industry standards  provide additional content and functionality and be successfully distributed in numerous changing worldwide markets 
if the company were unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and distribute such products in a timely manner  this inability would have a material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 
development 
product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia pcs are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
cd rom products frequently include more content and are more complex  time consuming and costly to develop and  accordingly  cause additional development and scheduling risk than earlier generation products 
for example  dungeon keeper  originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended june  shipped during the summer of in addition populous for pc cd and playstation were scheduled for shipment in the fiscal year ended march  and are now expected to ship in the fiscal year ending march  also  simcity  the follow on product to simcity  was expected to ship in fiscal  at the time of the merger with maxis 
due to additional development delays  it is anticipated that this product will ship during the first half of the fiscal year ending march  additionally  development risks for cd rom products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
the company s revenues and earnings are dependent on its ability to meet its product release schedule 
its failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year 
platform changes 
a large portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such as the playstation and the n the interdependent nature of the company s business and that of its hardware licensors brings significant risks to the company s business 
the success of the company s products is significantly affected by market acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms  and the company s ability to accurately predict these factors with respect to each platform 
in many cases  the company will have expended a large amount of development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems such as the new bit and bit systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will have continued product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than the company expected 
conversely  if the company does not choose to develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinues development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  the company s revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  the company has only released three products for the n through march since the introduction of this platform in september additionally  the company is developing a line of ea sports and other n products for release in fiscal the company believes that investment in products for the bit market  including both pc cd and cd video game platforms particularly the playstation was strategically important in positioning the company for the now completed transition to bit machines 
the company continues to believe that such investment is important and will continue its aggressive development activities for bit platforms 
although the playstation has achieved significant market acceptance in all geographic territories  there can be no assurance that its growth will continue at the present rates 
the market acceptance of the n  particularly in north america and europe  may adversely affect the growth rate of the bit cd platforms 
multiplayer online gaming 
while the company does not currently derive significant revenues from online games  the company believes that multiplayer online gaming will become a more significant factor in the company s business and in the interactive gaming business generally in the future 
online gaming  and particularly multiplayer online gaming such as the company s ultima online product  has at least four general areas of risk not currently associated with most packaged good sales 
first  the speed and reliability of the internet and the performance of the players internet service provider are not controlled by the company but impact game performance 
second  in massively multiplayer games such as ultima online  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects the performance of the game  and social issues raised by players conduct frequently determine player satisfaction 
the company s ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain 
third  the current business model is as yet experimental and maybe unsustainable  whether revenues will continue to be sufficient to maintain the significant support  service and product enhancement demands of online users is uncertain 
the company has little experience in pricing strategies for online games or in predicting usage patterns of its customers 
finally  the legal standards that may apply to online products are uncertain  the company has recently been sued in a class action lawsuit alleging defects in ultima online  regulation of the internet and the content it carries is regularly proposed by various legislators  and piracy of online games is difficult to prosecute under existing intellectual property laws 
the viability of this segment  generally  and the company s ability to compete in the segment will depend significantly on these and other factors outside the company s control 
hardware companies 
the company s contracts with hardware licensors  which are also some of the company s chief competitors  often grant significant control to the licensor over the manufacturing of the company s products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave the company unable to get its products manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the manufacturing process by hardware companies increases both the manufacturing lead times and the expense to the company as compared to the lead times and costs that the company can achieve independently 
for example  the company  in prior years  experienced delays in the manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the results of future periods may be affected by similar delays 
finally  the company s contracts with its hardware licensors often require the company to take significant risks in holding or prepaying for its inventory of products 
in particular  the company s agreement with nintendo for n products requires prepayment of costly cartridge based inventory  minimum orders and no rights of return 
revenue and expenses 
a substantial majority of the revenue of the company in any quarter typically results from orders received and products introduced in that quarter 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on development of products to be released in the future 
certain overhead and product development expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues 
this trend is increasing as the company increases the proportion of products developed internally 
as a result  the company s quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly revenues  operating results and net income to fall significantly below anticipated levels 
the company typically receives orders shortly before shipments  making backlog an unreliable indicator of quarterly results 
a shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause the results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
gross margins 
gross margins for the company s products as a whole decreased over the last year 
the company expects that margins may be consistent with or decline from fiscal levels for several reasons 
first  the mix in sales of the company s products has a significant effect on gross margins 
if the proportion of al revenues continues to increase in relation to other revenues  margins may continue to decline 
similarly  as the company releases more n products  which carry significantly lower margins due to high cost of goods  overall gross margins may continue to decline 
further  gross margins continue to be affected by increases in professional and celebrity license fees and royalties 
also  while the costs of development of new products for bit and bit systems have increased  overall costs of goods are not declining significantly 
for products on platforms for which the company is required to purchase its goods from the hardware companies  the company is unable to achieve cost reductions through manufacturing efficiencies  and in addition  pays manufacturing royalties to hardware companies 
additionally  retailers continue to require significant price protection for products 
with an increasing number of titles available for advanced platforms  such requirements for price protection may increase 
the company also anticipates that retail and wholesale prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may be further adversely affected 
marketing and distribution 
both the video game and pc businesses have become increasingly hits driven 
additional marketing and advertising funds are required to drive and support hit products  particularly expenditures for television advertising 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to produce hit titles  or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses 
employees 
competition for employees in the interactive software business continues to be intense 
large software and media companies frequently offer significantly larger cash compensation than does the company  placing pressure on the company s base salary and cash bonus compensation 
small start up companies such as those proliferating in the online business areas offer significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies like the company to match without significant stockholder dilution 
while executive turnover has decreased in fiscal as compared to prior years  many key executives continue to experience intense recruiting pressure 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain enough qualified employees in the future 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations 
for the fiscal year  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
the company expects foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of the company s revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
as a result of current economic conditions in asia  the company is subject to additional foreign currency risk 
though the company does not currently derive a significant portion of revenues and operating profits from sales in asia and other developing countries  the company s foreign currency exposure may increase as the company s operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends in asia continue 
there can be no assurance that these or other factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
investments in affiliates 
the company has a number of equity investments in affiliates  including small developers  such as firaxis  other publishers  such as accolade  inc and novalogic  inc  and new ventures such as mpath interactive 
additionally  the company has an equity investment in the do company 
these companies are generally small and may not have significant financial resources 
financial difficulties for any of these companies could cause a reduction in the value of the company s investment 
fluctuations in stock price 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this annual report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of the company s common stock historically has been  and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  entertainment  media or electronics industries or the securities markets in general 
for example  during the fiscal years and the price per share of the company s common stock ranged from to and from to  respectively 
seasonality 
the company s business is highly seasonal 
the company typically experiences its highest revenues and profits in the calendar year end holiday season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in june 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
