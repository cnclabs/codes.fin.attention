item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives substantially all of its earnings from the purchase  securitization and servicing of automobile loans 
at the time of purchase of each loan  the company pays a portion of the annual rate of interest paid by the obligor apr to the dealer for originating the loan dealer participation 
to fund the purchase of loans prior to securitization  the company utilizes its available cash balances and short term borrowing and repurchase arrangements with financial institutions and institutional lenders warehouse facilities 
pending securitization  automobile loans held for sale by the company generate net interest income resulting from the difference between the interest rate earned on automobile loans held for sale and the interest costs associated with the company s short term borrowings the net interest rate spread 
the company purchases loans under a tiered pricing system  allowing it to price loans according to the borrower s credit characteristics 
the company prices its loan products in order to maximize gross interest rate spreads relative to expected net losses within each tier 
classic loans purchased in represented of total purchasing volume compared with during and during and had aprs typically ranging from to while loans purchased under the premier program had aprs typically ranging from to 
the higher aprs of the classic program are intended to compensate the company for anticipated higher delinquency  default and loss rates associated with the classic program  which the company addresses through higher reserves for loan losses 
at december   the company maintained million in loan loss reserves  or of its servicing portfolio  compared to million  or  respectively  at december  the company aggregates the automobile loans it purchases and sells them to a trust  which in turn sells asset backed securities to investors 
by securitizing its loans  the company is able to fix the initial difference gross interest rate spread between the apr on automobile loans purchased and the interest rate on the asset backed securities sold securitization rate 
when the company securitizes its automobile loans  it records a gain on sale and establishes an asset referred to as finance income receivable 
gain on sale is determined by the difference between the net proceeds received and the basis of the loans sold as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas and is adjusted for any hedging gains and losses 
finance income receivable represents the company s retained interest in the loans sold and is determined by allocating the carrying amount of loans sold based on the relative fair value of such loans and the estimated future cash flows expected to be received by the company discounted at a market based rate 
the company s estimate of future excess cash flows takes into consideration i contractual obligations of the obligors  ii amounts due to the investors in asset backed securities  iii amounts paid to dealers for dealer participations  iv various costs of the securitizations  and v the effect of estimated prepayments of loans  losses incurred in connection with defaults  and corresponding reductions in the weighted average apr of loans sold 
subsequent to securitization  the company continues to service the securitized loans  for which it recognizes servicing fee income over the life of the securitization as earned 
in addition to the present value of estimated future cash flows from securitizations  finance income receivable includes accrued interest receivable on automobile loans held for sale through the date of sale  which will be returned to the company through the securitization trust  and the interest earned on previously discounted cash flows  calculated at the present value discount rate used in determining the initial estimate of future cash flows 
as noted above  future servicing fee income is recognized as earned and is not included in finance income receivable 
finance income receivable is reduced based on distributions to the company of excess cash flows from spread accounts 
the company uses a combination of its own historical experience  industry statistics and expectations of future performance to estimate the amount and timing of prepayments  losses upon defaults and corresponding changes in the weighted average apr 
the company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its finance income receivable to assess the impact of actual prepayment and loss experience compared with the company s estimates 
any impairment of finance income receivable  deemed to be permanent  is reflected as a reduction of current period earnings 
the company recorded such an adjustment during see special charges 
results of operations special charges 
included in the company s financial results are two special charges taken in march these charges include a non cash after tax charge of approximately million  due primarily to a change in accounting estimate and modifications to the company s retail disposition strategy  and an extraordinary charge of approximately million  net of tax  due to the early extinguishment of the company s senior term notes  due see extraordinary items 
approximately million of the million after tax charge is due to i a change in estimated recovery rates on current repossessed inventory and anticipated future inventory arising from existing securitization transactions  and ii a change in the company s accounting policy with respect to the estimated recovery rate realized upon disposition of repossessed inventory 
the remaining million after tax charge relates to various litigation and severance charges see operating expenses 
the recovery rate on repossessed inventory is measured by the liquidation amount realized on the repossessed vehicles as a percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the charged off loans associated with the repossessed vehicles 
the company s change in estimated recovery rates was based  in part  on a decline in the weighted average recovery rate experienced by the company during the first three months of during the first quarter of  the weighted average recovery rate on repossessed vehicles declined to approximately from approximately for the year ended december  this reduction in recovery rates primarily reflected an increase in the company s liquidation of repossessed inventory through wholesale auctions 
the company increased its use of wholesale auctions after a review by the company s new chief executive officer and other members of management conducted in mid march indicated that based on the number of retail dispositions during the first half of march the company s retail distribution channels were not sufficient to liquidate vehicles at a pace satisfactory to management and would not  in the foreseeable future  be adequate to exceed the number of additional repossessions expected each month 
in order to reduce the company s repossessed inventory to a level more acceptable to management  the company sold a significantly increased number of repossessed vehicles at wholesale auctions during the last half of march as a result  the company sold approximately of first quarter sales of repossessed vehicles through wholesale auctions  as compared with during calendar year the company s recovery rates were also affected during the first quarter of by lower pricing of repossessed vehicles sold through the company s retail distribution channels in an attempt to accelerate the liquidation of repossessed vehicles while maintaining consistent credit quality 
estimated recovery rates are also determined by an analysis of anticipated recovery trends in future periods 
based on its evaluation of certain events occurring late in the first quarter of  the company believed that recovery rates were not likely to increase above the level experienced during the first quarter of and that certain events might cause a further decline in these rates in future periods 
as explained above  the company did not believe that it had sufficient capacity to sell an increasing number of repossessed vehicles through its existing network of retail consignment dealers 
accordingly  the company expects to control the size of its repossessed inventory by continuing to increase the use of wholesale auctions to dispose of repossessed vehicles 
in april  the company s new chief executive officer completed a review of the company s retail disposition strategy 
consequently  based on the recommendation of the new chief executive officer  the company adopted modifications to its retail disposition strategy that were intended to reduce liquidity requirements of this strategy and establish more efficient operating procedures 
the company s retail disposition strategy generally requires it to hold a repossessed vehicle in inventory for a longer period of time than would a wholesale disposition strategy  and as a consequence delays the receipt of excess cash flows from securitization trusts following default of a loan 
in light of this  in april the company established a policy that limits the length of time a repossessed vehicle may be held for resale through retail channels 
the limitation on the length of time a repossessed vehicle is held for sale is intended to reduce delays in cash flow  but may reduce overall recovery rates due to an increased use of wholesale auctions 
the company intends to measure the effectiveness of the modified retail distribution strategy by the program s profitability as compared to a wholesale disposition strategy 
management of the retail disposition program will be accountable for optimizing the recovery rates on the repossessed inventory and achieving acceptable profitability levels 
as a result  management expects that the managers responsible for the modified retail disposition program will increase the use of wholesale auctions to control inventory size and the costs associated with the operation of the program 
the company s retail disposition strategy  as modified  is relatively new and evolving  and therefore  the company s management has concluded that recoveries under the program are uncertain and may be subject to further change 
in addition  in early the company anticipated a continued softening of the used car market and therefore lower retail and wholesale prices 
factors contributing to this market softening included the start up of superstore competition and forecasted levels of used lease vehicles that will be available in the market 
further  the company considered the risk of potentially higher interest rates  which have a direct impact on pricing of vehicles 
the company concluded that  for the reasons described above  future recovery rates after giving effect to related costs would be lower for the foreseeable future than those reflected in the company s prior accounting estimates 
in light of these items  the company elected to record an after tax charge of approximately million in march which reflected an adjustment of current inventory and estimated reduction to future cash flows due to lower expected recovery rates on future repossessed inventory arising from existing securitization trusts 
at the same time as the company changed its estimated recovery rates  the company also deemed it appropriate to review its accounting policy concerning the valuation of repossessed vehicles in light of the modifications to its retail disposition strategy and other factors 
as a result of this review  the company decided to change its accounting policy concerning the valuation of repossessed vehicles 
this change in policy requires the company to record all current and expected repossessed vehicles at recovery rates that reflect expected values to be achieved through wholesale auctions  regardless of the specific asset disposition strategy to be employed 
to the extent actual results are more favorable than estimates  greater recoveries are reflected in current period earnings when the vehicles are liquidated 
as a consequence of this policy change  the company s results of operations will depend  in part  on sales prices for used vehicles in wholesale auctions 
declines in wholesale recovery rates may adversely affect the company s results unless offset by higher retail recovery rates during the period 
the company believes that the revised accounting policy will better reflect its modified retail disposition strategy and accommodate a better understanding by users of the company s financial statements 
moreover  the company believes this change in accounting policy provides a financial presentation that is more comparable to that of other consumer finance companies and responds to recent events in the consumer finance industry which  the company believes  provide further evidence that lower estimated recovery rates are appropriate 
for these reasons  the company believes the change in accounting policy adopted in april reflects a preferable application of generally accepted accounting principles 
because the change in policy is inseparable from the estimation process referred to above  it is appropriate to reflect the effect of the change in accounting policy of approximately million after tax as a reduction to current period earnings 
net interest margin 
the company s net interest margin represents the sum of i net interest on loans held for sale based on the net interest rate spread  ii investment earnings on short term investments and other cash accounts and iii the recognition of the interest component of previously discounted cash flows  calculated at the present value discount rate used in the calculation of gain on sale 
the components of net interest margin for each of the three years in the period ended december  were dollars in thousands interest income on loans  net    interest income on short term investments and other cash accounts    recognition of present value discount    provision for credit losses on loans held for sale  net interest margin    the rise in net interest margin is primarily due to i growth in the average balances of loans held for sale pending securitization  ii wider net interest rate spreads earned on loans held for sale and iii interest earned on securitization related cash accounts  partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for sale 
the reduction in the rate of increase of net interest margin during compared to reflects the slow down in the growth of loan purchases partially offset by a rise in net interest rate spreads 
the company s loan purchasing and securitization volume for each of the three years ended december  is set forth in the table below 
dollars in thousands premier    classic    total automobile loan purchases    automobile loans securitized    in  the company initiated a program to increase the proportion of classic loans in its loan purchase mix in order to maximize gross interest rate spreads relative to expected net losses within each credit tier  to expand its share of the automobile loan market and to reduce initial cash requirements relative to those required by the premier program because the company offers lower dealer participations on classic loans 
as a result  approximately of the company s aggregate loan purchases were being made under the classic program during  compared with in and in the company may change its loan purchase mix at any time and from time to time 
the rise in loan purchasing volume resulted in an increase in the average monthly balance of loans held for sale to million during  up from million and million during and  respectively  on which the company earns net interest rate spread until such loans are securitized 
the weighted average net interest rate spread earned during rose to compared with and during and  respectively 
the rise in net interest spread earned on loans held for sale is principally due to higher average annual percentage rates apr paid by obligors primarily resulting from expansion of the company s higher rate classic loan program 
interest income on short term investments increased between and and between and this increase is primarily due to growth in the aggregate balance of securitization related cash accounts associated with the continued expansion of the securitization program 
income from the recognition of present value discount grew due to the increased volume of securitizations 
gain on sale of loans 
during  the company recognized a non recurring pre tax charge to gain on sale of loans of million see special charges 
excluding this non recurring charge  the company realized a gain on sale of loans of approximately million  compared with million and million during and  respectively 
the reduction in gain on sale of loans during  before the non recurring charge  is primarily due to increases in the loss rate  servicing fee and discount factor assumptions utilized in the company s computation of estimated future cash flows see special charges 
this impact was partially mitigated by a increase in loan securitization volume and a basis point widening of the gross interest rate spread earned on loans securitized see table below 
the increase in gain on sale of loans in over resulted primarily from the growth in the volume of loans securitized  increased gross interest rate spreads  and a decline in the participation rate paid to dealers for loan originations  partially offset by an increase in the reserve for loan losses established in connection with an increased volume of classic loans 
the following table summarizes the company s gross interest rate spreads for each of the three years in the period ended december  weighted average apr of loans securitized weighted average securitization rate gross interest rate spread before gains losses on hedge transactions 
the rise in the gross interest rate spread during and is primarily due to an increased proportion of higher yielding classic loans  resulting in an increased apr earned on loans purchased and subsequently securitized 
any unamortized balance of participations paid to dealers is expensed at the time the related loans are securitized and recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale 
due to the increased proportion of classic loan purchases  which generally require lower participation rates than premier loans  and a reduction of the maximum participation rate allowable under the premier program  participations paid as a percentage of the principal balance of loan purchases declined to during from and during and  respectively 
gain on sale of loans has been adjusted for million  million and million of net realized losses on hedging transactions during  and  respectively see hedging and pre funding strategy 
servicing fee income 
the components of servicing fee income for each of the three years in the period ended december  were dollars in thousands contractual servicing fee income    other servicing income    servicing fee income    the company earns contractual servicing fee income for servicing loans sold to investors through securitizations 
the servicing fee is per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the loans for all securitizations entered into prior to september and per annum on loans included in and subsequent to the third quarter securitization 
the growth in contractual servicing fee income is primarily related to an increase in the average servicing portfolio outstanding 
other servicing income consists primarily of collection fees  such as late payment fees and insufficient fund charges  and interest on collection accounts earned by the company as servicer of the loans 
the rise in other servicing income is principally due to increases in income from late fees and insufficient fund charges reflecting the increase in delinquency rates and growth in the company s servicing portfolio see delinquency  loan loss and repossession experience and increased collection account interest attributable to the growth in the average servicing portfolio outstanding and related obligor repayments 
the following table reflects the growth in the company s servicing portfolio from to at december  dollars in thousands  except as noted principal balance of automobile loans held for sale    principal balance of loans serviced under securitizations    servicing portfolio    average outstanding principal balance actual dollars    number of loans serviced    the company s servicing portfolio increased from to and between and this increase reflects loan purchases and subsequent securitizations of billion and billion during and  respectively  partially offset by defaults and scheduled repayments 
the decline in average outstanding principal balance of loans during reflects an increase in the proportion of used to new cars financed by the company 
salaries and benefits expense 
salaries and benefits increased to million during from million and million during and  respectively  representing an increase of during and during this increase is primarily due to growth in number of employees 
the company had  employees at december   compared with  and at december  and  respectively 
increased staffing has been necessary to accommodate the rise in loan purchasing volume and the subsequent servicing of such loans and reflects additional employees hired to staff four regional collection centers opened from october through december of general and administrative and other operating expenses other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased during to million  up from million in and million in other operating expenses include occupancy and equipment leasing charges  depreciation  outside professional fees  communication costs  servicing and collection expenses  marketing expenses  recruiting and staffing fees  travel  office supplies and other 
the increase in other operating costs during is primarily a result of the higher percentage of classic program loans in the portfolio which generally require greater collection efforts and related costs including increased telephone  fax  postage and repossession expenses than premier program loans 
in addition  an overall increase in delinquency rates during further contributed to an increase in loan and collection expenses 
the company has also experienced an increase in operating lease expense during attributable to a shift from the utilization of capital leases to operating leases 
also included in the operating costs during is a one time pre tax charge of approximately million primarily related to legal costs associated with defending litigation against the company as well as costs associated with resolving legal issues involving alleged improper practices at certain of the company s initial consignment dealers 
the company has since terminated its business relationship with such dealers 
also included in the special charge were severance expenses for certain former executives of the company 
the increase in other operating expenses during was driven by the growth in loan purchasing volume and the company s servicing portfolio  as well as an increase in occupancy and equipment charges related to the expansion of the regional collection and buying centers during and as a result of the items noted above  total operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  rose to of average servicing portfolio during compared with and in and  respectively 
impact of year the company recognizes that the arrival of the year poses a unique worldwide challenge to the ability of all computer systems to recognize the date change from december  to january  and  like other companies  is assessing  enhancing and updating its computer applications and business processes to provide for their continued functionality after said date 
in connection with its initiative to replace and enhance key operating systems  the company has engaged outside consultants to assist in the design and implementation of various systems that will be year compliant 
the company anticipates that the testing and implementation of such systems will be completed by mid  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs associated with the year project will be primarily for the purchase of the new software being developed to replace and enhance the company s current operating systems 
consistent with its capitalization policy  the costs of the company s new operating software will be capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
as such  the company believes that the impact of the year issue will not have a material effect on the results of operations 
long term debt and other interest expense 
long term debt and other interest expense rose during and in the increase in is primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes during  partially offset by the concurrent extinguishment of million of senior term notes 
the increase in was primarily due to the issuance of million of subordinated notes in march and million of senior term notes in april subsequently extinguished in 
income tax expense 
due to the difference in the basis of the finance income receivable for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes  the company continues to have available million of tax net operating loss carryforwards  a portion of which may be available to offset against income taxes in and future years  subject to applicable limitations 
the million income tax benefit during including the tax effect of an extraordinary item primarily reflects the company s estimated reduction to its deferred tax liability as of december  resulting primarily from a special charge during the first quarter of extraordinary items 
in march  the company issued million senior notes and utilized approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase and covenant defease the company s million senior term notes  including accrued interest of million and a premium of approximately million 
these charges and additional professional fees incurred to retire such debt have been treated as an extraordinary item  net of tax 
in february  the company entered into a temporary financing facility the facility under which it borrowed million through the issuance of senior notes during february and april of  and utilized the proceeds to retire the company s then outstanding million of senior secured notes 
in april  the company issued common stock and million of senior term notes and applied the proceeds to retire the notes issued under the facility and the company s then outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the prepayment fees for the early extinguishment of debt and the charge off of capitalized debt financing costs associated with such debt were accounted for as extraordinary items  net of tax 
preferred dividends 
the company paid dividends on its preferred stock outstanding of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in dividends paid from to is due to the conversion of preferred shares into common stock of the company 
as of december   all preferred shares had been redeemed or converted 
financial condition due from securitization trust 
at december  and december   the company had delivered million and million  respectively  of loans into a securitization trust for which the company received cash from the trust concurrent with the legal closing of the transaction in january and january  respectively 
the decrease in due from securitization trust is due to a reduction in the purchasing volume of loans during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of automobile loans held for sale 
the company holds automobile loans for sale in its portfolio prior to securitization 
the company s portfolio of loans held for sale increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the timing in delivery of loans associated with the company s securitizations 
finance income receivable 
finance income receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase represents amounts capitalized upon completion of securitization transactions during related to the present value of estimated cash flows 
finance income receivable at december  was also reduced by a non recurring million pre tax charge recorded in march of see special charges 
reserve for losses on securitized loans is included as a component of finance income receivable 
restricted cash in spread accounts 
restricted cash in spread accounts increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase reflects the company s continued securitization of loan purchases and the related accumulation of excess cash flows to levels defined within each securitization agreement and due to initial deposits related to certain securitizations  partially offset by the release of excess cash flows to the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  arcadia receivables finance corp 
furniture  fixtures and equipment 
furniture  fixtures and equipment increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the company s investment in new computer hardware and software technology  as well as office equipment for expansion of the regional collection and buying centers 
senior notes 
senior notes increased to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase reflects the issuance of million and million of senior notes in march and october  respectively  partially offset by the concurrent extinguishment of million of senior notes in march the senior notes issued in march included detachable warrants that when exercised entitle the holders to acquire an aggregate  shares of the company s common stock 
the value of the warrants  determined at the time of debt issuance  was treated as a discount on the senior notes issued and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the senior notes 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes  principally net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes and the finance income receivable  respectively 
the company s estimated net deferred tax liability at december   was million  compared to million at december  this decrease reflects the recognition of a tax benefit from the two special charges taken in march see special charges 
other liabilities 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to interest accruals associated with the increase in the outstanding principal amount of senior notes see senior term notes 
delinquency  loan loss and repossession experience the company s operating performance  financial condition and liquidity are materially affected by the performance of the automobile loans purchased  securitized and serviced by the company 
in connection with the servicing of automobile loans  the company is responsible for managing delinquent loans  repossessing the underlying collateral in the event of default and selling repossessed collateral 
the company provides an allowance for credit losses inherent in sold loans and includes such allowance as a component of the fair value of finance income receivable utilized to allocate the carrying amount of loans sold in determining gain on sale 
management believes that the company s allowance for estimated credit losses adequately provides for potential future losses on securitized loans 
the following tables describe the delinquency  credit loss and repossession experience  respectively  of the company s servicing portfolio for the three years in the period ended december  a delinquent loan may result in the repossession and foreclosure of the collateral for the loan 
losses resulting from repossession and disposition of automobiles are charged against applicable allowances  which management reviews on a monthly basis 
there can be no assurance that future delinquency  credit loss and repossession experience will be comparable to that set forth below 
at december  delinquency experience number of number of number of loans balances loans balances loans balances dollars in thousands servicing portfolio at end of period       delinquencies days       days      days or more      total loans delinquent or more days       delinquencies as a percentage of number of loans and amount outstanding at end of period amount in repossession total delinquencies and amount in repossession       all amounts and percentages are based on the principal amount scheduled to be paid on each loan 
the information in the table includes previously sold loans which the company continues to service 
amounts shown do not include loans which are less than days delinquent 
amount in repossession represents financed automobiles which have been charged off but not yet liquidated 
year ended december  credit loss repossession experience dollars in thousands average servicing portfolio outstanding during the period    average number of loans outstanding during the period    number of charge offs    gross charge offs    recoveries   net losses    gross charge offs as a percentage of average servicing portfolio net losses as a percentage of average servicing portfolio all amounts and percentages are based on the principal amount scheduled to be paid on each loan 
the information in the table includes previously sold loans which the company continues to service 
gross charge offs represent principal amounts which management estimated to be uncollectable after the consideration of anticipated proceeds from the disposition of repossessed assets and selling expenses 
includes post disposition amounts received on previously charged off loans 
the increase in delinquencies  gross charge offs and net losses during is primarily due to the continued seasoning of the company s existing servicing portfolio to include a greater proportion of loans in the period of highest probability for delinquencies and defaults generally six to months from the date of origination  especially with respect to the company s premier loan portfolio 
much of the increase in performance statistics is due to performance of loans originated in and the first half of which represent approximately of the servicing portfolio 
as expected  performance statistics have also increased during as a result of a rise in the proportion of classic loans in the company s portfolio 
at december   the portfolio consisted of approximately classic loans compared to at the same time a year ago 
net losses during the year have been further affected by selling an increased proportion of repossessed vehicles through wholesale auctions 
during  the company liquidated approximately of all repossessed vehicles sold through wholesale auctions compared to during because recovery rates are generally lower on vehicles sold at auction compared to those liquidated through retail channels  the increased utilization of auctions has increased net losses experienced by the company 
included in the gross charge off and net loss statistics is a special charge of approximately million resulting from a revision to the company s inventory valuation policy see special charges 
the increase in the rate of delinquencies  gross charge offs  net losses and repossessions during  experienced by both the premier and classic programs  was primarily due to i increased demands on the company s servicing and collection resources as the result of rapid growth in its servicing portfolio and as a result of continued expansion of the classic loan program which generally requires greater collection efforts than the premier program  ii the performance of the company s discontinued classic product for first time automobile buyers and the company s financed repossession program  which experienced significantly higher delinquencies  repossessions and losses than the company s other products and programs and iii the continued seasoning of the company s servicing portfolio 
the significant rise in repossession inventory levels during was the result of the growth in the company s servicing portfolio and increased utilization of retail distribution channels to liquidate repossessed automobiles 
liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to purchase and finance automobile loans pending securitization  ii dealer participations  iii cash held from time to time in restricted spread accounts to support securitizations and warehouse facilities and other securitization expenses  iv interest advances to securitization trusts  v repossession inventory  and vi interest expense 
the company also uses significant amounts of cash for operating expenses 
the company receives cash principally from interest on loans held pending securitization  from excess cash flow received from securitization trusts and from fees earned through servicing of loans held by such trusts 
the company has operated on a negative operating cash flow basis and expects to continue to do so in the near future 
the company has historically funded  and expects to continue to fund  these negative operating cash flows  subject to limitations in various debt covenants  principally through borrowings from financial institutions  sales of equity securities and sales of senior and subordinated notes  among other resources  although there can be no assurance that the company will have access to capital markets in the future or that financing will be available to satisfy the company s operating and debt service requirements or to fund its future growth 
see capital resources 
principal uses of cash in operating activities purchases and financing of automobile loans 
automobile loan purchases represent the company s most significant cash flow requirement 
the company funds the purchase price of loans primarily through the use of warehouse facilities 
however  because advance rates under the warehouse facilities generally provide funds ranging from to of the principal balance of the loans  the company is required to fund the remainder of all purchases prior to securitization with other available cash resources 
the company purchased billion of loans in  compared with billion in and billion in amounts borrowed under warehouse facilities are repaid upon securitization of the loans 
the company regularly completes securitizations to optimize its use of available warehouse facilities and the company s cash investment in loans held for sale 
dealer participations 
consistent with industry practice  the company pays dealers participations for selling loans to the company 
when loans are securitized  the related dealer participation is expensed and subsequently recovered over the estimated life of the underlying loans through the return to the company of excess cash flow from securitization trusts 
aggregate participations paid by the company to dealers in were million  compared with million in and million in these participations typically require the company to advance an up front amount to dealers  which represented of the principal balance of loans purchased during compared to in and in the decrease in dealer participations paid as a percentage of the principal balance of loans purchased reflects the growth in volume of loans purchased under the classic program  which generally requires a lower participation payout rate and a reduction in the cap on participation rates paid on premier loans 
the company has some limited ability to recover dealer participations from the dealers by offset against future participations in the event of prepayment or default on the related loan within a specified period of time 
however  to the extent the loan does not prepay or default within that period of time  the company expects to recover the cash used to pay dealer participations over the estimated life of the underlying loans through the return to the company of excess cash flows from securitization spread accounts 
this relationship between the up front payment of cash to the dealers and the deferred recovery through collection of excess cash flow will continue to represent a significant demand on capital resources to the extent the company expands the growth of loan purchases 
securitization of automobile loans 
in connection with securitizations  the company incurs certain expenses  including underwriting fees  credit enhancement fees  trustee fees and other costs  and is required to fund spread accounts related to each transaction 
the company funds these spread accounts by foregoing receipt of excess cash flow until these spread accounts exceed predetermined levels generally within months of the formation of the securitization trust 
in certain securitizations  the company also has been required to provide initial cash deposits into such accounts 
the amount of time required to initially fund each spread account varies depending on numerous factors  including  but not limited to i the size of any required initial deposit  ii the gross interest rate spread  iii defaults  iv delinquencies  v losses and vi turnover of repossession inventory 
the company had million of restricted cash in spread accounts at december   compared with million at december advances due to servicer 
as the servicer of loans sold in securitizations  the company periodically makes interest advances to the securitization trusts to provide for temporary delays in the receipt of required interest payments by borrowers 
in accordance with the relevant servicing agreements  the company makes advances only in the event that it expects to recover such advances through the ultimate payments from the obligor over the life of the loan 
beginning in december  the company s servicing agreements were modified to require interest advances only when the related loan is days delinquent or greater 
repossession inventory 
at december   repossessed inventory managed or owned by the company and held for resale was million  compared with million at december  the rate of repossessed inventory turnover impacts cash available for spread accounts under securitization trusts and  consequently  the excess cash available for distribution to the company 
at december   repossessed inventory was of the total servicing portfolio compared with at december  any improvement in excess cash flows due to an increase in the inventory turnover rate may be partially reduced by lower recoveries realized through an increased use of wholesale auctions 
interest expense 
although the company records net interest margin as earned  a significant portion of the interest income component is generally received in cash from excess cash flow  while the interest expense component primarily warehousing interest is paid prior to securitization 
principal sources of cash in operating activities excess cash flow 
the company receives excess cash flow from securitization trusts  including the realization of gain on sale  the recovery of dealer participations  and the recovery of accrued interest receivable earned  but not yet collected  on loans held for sale 
recovery of dealer participations and accrued interest receivable  which occur throughout the life of the securitization  result in a reduction of the finance income receivable and  because they have been considered in the original determination of the gain on sale of loans  have no effect on the company s results of operations in the year in which the participations and interest are recovered from the securitization trust 
during  the company received million of excess cash flow  compared with million in and million in the rate of increase in excess cash flow during exceeded the rate of increase in loans securitized principally because spread accounts related to securitizations have reached required reserve levels and have begun releasing cash during the current year 
these obligations generally reach pre determined spread account levels within months following the formation of the securitization trust 
servicing fees 
the company also receives servicing fees for servicing securitized loans included in various securitization trusts 
the servicing fee for loans in securitization trusts is equal to one percent per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the loans for all securitizations entered into prior to september and percent per annum on loans subsequently securitized 
the company received cash for such services in the amount of million  million and million during  and  respectively  which is reflected in the company s revenues as earned 
capital resources the company finances the acquisition of automobile loans primarily through i warehouse facilities  pursuant to which loans are sold or financed generally on a temporary basis and ii the securitization of loans  pursuant to which loans are sold as asset backed securities 
additional financing is required to fund the company s operations 
warehouse facilities 
automobile loans held for sale are funded on a short term basis primarily through warehouse facilities 
at december   the company had three warehouse facilities in place with various financial institutions and institutional lenders with an aggregate capacity of million  of which million was available 
two of the liquidity facilities supporting the warehouse facilities are subject to renewal or extension at various times in at the option of the lenders 
the company has a commitment extending into for the third facility 
proceeds from securitizations  generally received within seven to ten days following the cut off date established for the securitization transaction  are applied to repay amounts then outstanding under warehouse facilities 
securitization program 
an important capital resource for the company has been its ability to sell automobile loans in the secondary markets through securitizations 
the following table summarizes the company s securitizations during the three years ended december   all of which have been publicly issued and were rated aaa by standard poor s and aaa by moody s investor services  inc remaining remaining balance as a current weighted gross dollars in thousands balance as percentage weighted average interest original of december of original average securitization rate date balance  balance apr rate spread february   march   june   september   december   march   june   september   december   march   june   september   december   at december   million of automobile loans had been delivered to the trust and million cash remained in the pre funded portion of the trust 
in january  the company delivered sufficient loans to the trust and obtained the release of the remaining cash in the pre funded portion of the trust 
see hedging and pre funding strategy below 
the company utilizes net proceeds from securitizations to invest in additional loan purchases and to repay warehouse indebtedness  thereby making its warehouse facilities available for further purchases of automobile loans 
at december   the company had securitized approximately billion of automobile loans since its inception in  and had remaining balances of approximately billion 
all of the company s securitization trusts and one of the company s warehouse facilities are credit enhanced through financial guaranty insurance policies issued by fsa  which insure payment of principal and interest due on the related asset backed securities 
in order to obtain fsa insurance  the company is obligated to establish spread accounts  and to maintain such spread accounts at pre determined levels  in connection with each insured securitization through the collection and restriction of excess cash flow from the loans securitized 
these spread accounts are funded through initial deposits  when required  and out of excess cash flow from the related securitization trust 
thereafter  during each month excess cash flow due to arfc from all insured securitization trusts is first used to replenish spread accounts to predetermined levels and is then distributed to the company 
if excess cash flow from all insured securitization trusts is not sufficient to replenish all spread accounts  no cash flow would be available to the company from arfc for that month 
excess cash flows include cash received from the liquidation of repossessions under defaulted receivables 
such cash is generally received in months subsequent to default and can therefore result in timing differences as to when excess cash flows are released to the company 
the spread account for each insured securitization trust is cross collateralized with the spread accounts established for the company s other insured securitization trusts 
excess cash flow from performing securitization trusts insured by fsa may be used to support negative cash flow from  or to replenish a deficit spread account in connection with  non performing securitization trusts insured by fsa 
the company s obligations to fsa in respect of insured securitizations and one of the company s warehouse facilities are limited to the amounts on deposit in the spread accounts and excess cash flow 
in connection with its securitizations  the company continually seeks to improve its structures to reduce up front costs and to maximize excess cash flow available to the company 
the company may consider alternative securitization structures  including senior subordinated tranches  and alternative forms of credit enhancement  such as letters of credit and surety bonds 
during  the company realized a portion of its finance income receivable by selling an interest only strip in its september securitization 
proceeds from the sale of the interest only strips were approximately million in there were no interest only strips sold during or the structure of each securitized sale of loans will depend on market conditions  costs of securitization and the availability of credit enhancement options to the company 
hedging and pre funding strategy 
the company employs hedging strategies  including the use of pre funding accounts in connection with securitization transactions and forward us treasuries  to manage its gross interest rate spread 
through the use of these hedging strategies  the company is able to determine its approximate financing cost prior to  or near to  the purchase of loans and thereby maintain its gross interest rate spread within a desired range 
because interest rates on asset backed securities for automobile loans generally tend to rise or fall when other shorter term interest rates fluctuate  a material increase in interest rates prior to securitization could adversely affect the profitability of such securitization to the company in the absence of a hedging strategy 
by utilizing pre funding accounts in connection with securitization transactions  the company mitigates its exposure to interest rate risk through a pre funding strategy in which it securitizes its loans then held for sale along with future loans in a pre funded securitization 
in a pre funded securitization  the principal amount of the asset backed securities issued in the securitization exceeds the principal balance of loans initially delivered to the securitization trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in trust earning money market yields until released upon delivery of additional loans 
the company agrees to deliver additional loans into the securitization trust from time to time generally monthly equal in the aggregate to the amount by which the principal balance of the asset backed securities exceeds the principal balance of the loans initially delivered 
in pre funded securitizations  the company predetermines the borrowing costs with respect to loans it subsequently purchases and delivers into the securitization trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funding securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in trust prior to the subsequent delivery of loans and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities 
the company also has some interest rate exposure to falling interest rates to the extent that the company s offered rates decline after the company has engaged in a pre funded securitization  although the company s offered rates generally respond less rapidly to rate fluctuations than financing costs 
by selling forward us treasuries that most closely parallel the average life of its portfolio of loans held for sale  the company is able to obtain an inverse relationship between the loans being hedged and the us treasury market 
the hedging gain or loss is netted against the gain on sale of loans 
such hedges include certain risks created by the cash versus non cash relationship of the hedging instrument and the related securitization 
this relationship arises because us treasury forward contracts are settled with current cash payments and the gain on sale of loans represents the present value of estimated future cash flows 
to the extent hedging gains or losses resulting from us treasury forward contracts are significant  the resulting up front cash payments or receipts may impact the company s liquidity 
the company receives the up front gains or losses back over time through a higher or lower spread at the time of securitization 
hedging transactions required an initial net use of cash of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
management has controls and policies in place to assess and monitor its risk from hedging activities 
management reviews the interest rate movements in the us treasury markets and receives a daily internal report tracking such movements 
daily  management receives an interest rate report that describes not only interest rate movements  but also the amount of corresponding increase or decrease in the value of its hedged securitizations 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by members of the company s senior management  and are subject to approval by the company s chief executive officer 
in connection with this  management assesses factors including the interest rate environment  loan production levels and open positions of current hedging positions
