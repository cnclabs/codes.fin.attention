item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s market place 
the possibility of state or federal budget related mandates that reduce premiums for medicaid or medicare recipients 
the potential for increased medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
inflation in provider and pharmaceutical costs 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits or limit the company s oversight ability 
the possibility that the company is not able to expand its service territory as planned due to regulatory delays and or inability to contract with appropriate providers 
the possibility that the company is not able to increase its market share at the anticipated premium rates 
general during the three year period ended december   the company experienced rapid expansion through  followed by a year of relative stability 
while membership in certain products continues to grow  others have shown substantial decreases when compared with the company has achieved its overall size by continually expanding its product lines which include point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products  medicaid and medicare  group term life and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have remained at or near competitive levels for the company s market place 
during  the company s consolidated operating margin showed a profit after being slightly negative in the company achieved s results  in part  by implementing product price increases and reducing membership in products or effectively terminating groups that had the potential for continued unprofitability 
the company anticipates that it will continue to increase premium rates during this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of those risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially effected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of providers will result in continued profitability 
due to the continued escalation of health care costs and the inability of many individuals to obtain health care insurance  numerous proposals relating to health care reform have been made  and additional proposals may be introduced  in the united states congress and the legislatures of the states in which the company operates or may seek to operate 
recently  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  commonly called the kennedy kassebaum bill for its primary sponsors  was enacted 
this bill establishes certain federal requirements for large group  small group  and individual health benefit plans  and applies not only to insurers and hmos but also to erisa plans 
kennedy kassebaum is intended to make coverage more portable and available by limiting pre existing condition requirements  providing special enrollment periods for employees who lose other coverage or whose family status changes  prohibiting group plans from denying an individual coverage or charging a higher premium based on the individual s health status or history  and by guaranteeing coverage availability and renewability in certain circumstances in the small group and individual markets 
kennedy kassebaum also allows for the establishment of medical savings accounts  increases the penalties for health care fraud and abuse  and calls for standardized health care information in order to reduce administrative costs 
the effect of kennedy kassebaum differs from state to state 
in the group market  state laws remain in effect unless they prevent the application of the new federal requirements  and in the individual market  state laws govern if the health and human services secretary determines that it provides an acceptable alternative mechanism to the federal requirement 
this means that in those states like maryland  where state reforms have already been enacted  the legislation has little  if any  effect in the small group market  but may have some effect on the individual market 
in other states  the legislation has greater effect 
most of the provisions of kennedy kassebaum took effect on july   but some  like the provisions pertaining to medical savings accounts  took effect earlier and some  like administrative simplification  take effect later 
in recent years  state legislatures in the company s service area have been active in health care reform legislation targeted at the small group market  ie  usually for groups of to employees 
this small group reform is now in place in maryland  virginia  delaware and north carolina  but not in pennsylvania  washington  dc or west virginia 
although different in many of the details  this type of legislation generally requires all hmos and insurers that offer small group coverage to accept all small employers who apply for coverage and to guarantee coverage to their employees seeking coverage regardless of their health status 
the legislation also requires renewal of these small group employer plans  limits rate renewal increases  mandates adjusted community rating and eliminates pre existing condition limitations either entirely or within a short period of time  usually six months 
in addition  many states have begun to legislate certain mandated benefits like minimum hospital length of stays and required coverages 
the company believes that the current political environment in which it operates will result in continued legislative scrutiny of health care reform and may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact upon the company of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or health care financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the district of columbia  which has not previously regulated hmos  enacted legislation effective july  providing for regulatory oversight similar to that currently provided by other states 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative impact on its operations because of the new regulatory oversight in the district of columbia 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations consolidated net income loss of the company was  and  in and  respectively 
net earnings loss per share was 
in as compared to 
in the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to a decrease in the medical loss ratio for commercial products which was slightly offset by an increase in the administrative expense ratio 
the medical loss ratio decreased principally due to increased efforts by the company to control medical costs through utilization review  enhanced claim adjudication  and increased claims audit and claims reversal activity 
the company has priced its products competitively in order to increase its membership base and thereby enhance its strategic position in its market place 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia and certain areas of west virginia  north carolina and pennsylvania 
revenue for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent decrease in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in a decrease of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in the average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
the net decrease in revenue is mainly related to the company s withdrawal from the maryland medicaid program and from certain areas of the virginia medicaid program due to inadequate premiums paid by the states 
management believes that commercial health premiums should increase over the next twelve months as the company increases its commercial membership and as new and renewing groups are charged higher premium rates due to legislatively mandated benefit enhancements and general price increases initiated by the company 
effective january   the company has modified its medicare product offering 
this modification has the potential to significantly reduce the company s medicare membership and related premium revenue 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of the risk factors that may effect health premiums per member 
the company has implemented increased premium rates across essentially all of its commercial products which began to take effect in july  as the company s contracts are generally for a one year period  increased pricing cannot be initiated until a contract reaches its renewal date 
therefore  price increases cannot be made across the company s membership at the same time 
additionally  the company received an approximate percent premium rate increase in its virginia medicaid program effective july   an approximate percent premium rate decrease in its north carolina medicaid program effective august   and an approximate percent premium rate increase in its medicare program  effective january  management believes that the commercial premium rate increases may have the effect of slowing the company s future membership growth as compared to membership growth in through in addition  management reevaluated premium reimbursement rates with regard to its medicare and medicaid participation and reduced or eliminated certain service areas 
specifically  effective january   counties and cities were eliminated from the company s medicare service area 
effective january   the company again reduced its medicare service area  modified certain benefits and began charging an additional premium in certain areas 
also effective january   the company discontinued participation in the mandated portion of the virginia medicaid program which serves medicaid eligibles in the tidewater area of virginia 
in addition  the company has withdrawn from the maryland medicaid program due to changes to premium and benefit levels and other requirements made by the state of maryland after it obtained an waiver and became a mandated state 
as the company was the largest provider of managed care medicaid in maryland  the company continued to provide services in until an orderly transition was accomplished 
the company was compensated during the transition period at a rate higher than the mandated program allows but lower than historical reimbursement 
in  the company became licensed to serve portions of the medicaid populations in west virginia and north carolina 
the company s future membership growth depends on several factors such as relative premium prices and product availability  future increases or decreases in the company s service area  increased competition in the company s service area and changes in state mandated enrollment in medicaid hmo programs in which the company participates 
enrollment may also decrease if the company determines that premium reimbursement rates related to certain state medicaid programs are inadequate  which would cause the company to voluntarily withdraw from participation 
as previously described  this determination was made in connection with the maryland medicaid program and part of the virginia medicaid program 
service revenue from non mamsi affiliated entities earned by the company s home health care subsidiaries contributed million in revenue in as compared to million in this increase is the result of increasing business volume for these subsidiaries  particularly in the home infusion area  which is largely offset by an increasing relative percentage of business conducted for mamsi hmo and indemnity members which is eliminated in consolidation 
revenue from life and short term disability products contributed million in as compared to million in in  mamsi invited the national committee for quality assurance ncqa  a private  non profit organization  to evaluate the company s methodologies in an effort to receive ncqa accreditation 
ncqa accreditation is a voluntary process 
in the review  the company did not meet certain of ncqa s criteria and  therefore  did not receive ncqa accreditation 
in response  mamsi adopted methodologies and programs designed to respond to concerns and questions raised in ncqa s assessment 
the company requested the ncqa to perform another accreditation review which took place in december of in may   ncqa informed the company that its flagship hmos received one year accreditation 
the company has implemented the health plan and employer data and information set hedis which represents a core set of performance measures developed by ncqa to serve the employer as a purchaser 
in addition  in october  the maryland health care access and cost commission released the results of maryland s first ever statewide hmo report card 
mamsi s maryland hmos exceeded the state wide average in overall satisfaction  accessibility and quality 
in another survey of member satisfaction taken by the us office of personnel management  federal employees expressed satisfaction with the company s federally qualified hmo 
medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical loss ratio decreased to percent for as compared to percent for and  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses decreased percent 
this decrease is due to a combination of factors including continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  expanded activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the adoption of regionalized and product specific fee maximums for health services  and the identification and possible termination of certain providers and specialists from the delivery network following a continuing intensified peer review analysis 
in addition  during  the company identified certain claims which had been overpaid and recorded as a reduction of medical expenses approximately million relating to claims incurred and paid in the company believes that it has taken the appropriate action and implemented appropriate controls to ensure that future claims are paid at the appropriate amounts although the complexity of paying claims and the increasing sophistication of providers requires constant evaluation of historical payment patterns which might indicate improper payments 
additionally  the company has greatly expanded its initial health assessments of new medicare members after they have enrolled and has also increased its case management personnel 
these initiatives should help to control the company s medical loss ratio 
the statements in the preceding paragraphs regarding future utilization rates  cost containment initiatives  total medical costs and future increases in health premiums per member are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information above for a description of risk factors that may affect medical expenses per member and the medical loss ratio 
the administrative expense ratio for increased to percent as compared to percent for this increase is due primarily to increased salaries and expenses in certain administrative areas of the company  including utilization management  claims audit  and customer service departments  as well as reduced revenue 
management believes that the administrative expense ratio will remain near the current level over the next year 
management s expectations concerning the administrative expense ratio are forward looking statements 
the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums per member  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
the net margin rate increased from 
percent in to percent in this increase is primarily due to the decrease in the medical loss ratio 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations consolidated net income loss of the company was  and  in and  respectively 
diluted net earnings loss per share was 
in as compared to in the reduction in earnings is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the medical loss ratio for commercial products  continuing losses in the company s medicare product and lower earnings from the company s medicaid products 
the medical loss ratio increased principally due to increased member utilization 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while the average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  remained approximately the same 
service revenue from non mamsi affiliated entities earned by the company s home health care subsidiaries contributed million in revenue in as compared to million for this increase is the result of increasing business volume for these subsidiaries  particularly in the home infusion area  which is largely offset by an increasing relative percentage of business conducted for mamsi hmo and indemnity members which is eliminated in consolidation 
revenue from life and short term disability products contributed million in as compared to million in medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical loss ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent for and  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
this significant increase is due to a combination of factors including lower commercial premiums charged due to competitive forces  higher than expected utilization by commercial members  cost increases due to legislatively mandated benefits and extremely high medical expenses related to the company s medicare enrollment 
the administrative expense ratio for increased to percent from percent in this increase is due primarily to increased salaries and expenses in certain administrative areas of the company  including utilization management and customer service departments  as well as additional sales expenses in new expansion areas in investment income increased million or percent primarily due to an increase of million in realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities 
the net margin rate decreased from percent in to 
percent in this decrease is primarily due to the increase in the medical loss ratio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to health care providers  which generally vary in direct proportion to the health premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in provider billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source  coupled with the company s operating line of credit  will be sufficient in the future 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  this million increase is primarily due to amounts due from the federal government related to the company s federal employees health benefit program participation 
prepaid expenses  advances and other current assets decreased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to the receipt of tax refunds for net operating loss carrybacks 
statutory deposits increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the increase in state regulatory deposits related to certain of the company s regulated subsidiaries 
property and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the purchase of a new office building for existing and future office space needs as well as the replacement and upgrade of certain of the company s computer equipment 
short term investments are marked to market at the end of every quarter and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected in the ending stockholders equity balance 
accordingly  stockholders equity at december  reflects an unrealized gain of 
million  net of tax  on the company s short term investments 
medical claims payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to decreased membership  decreased member utilization and related claims accruals and reversals of claims previously paid 
additional paid in capital decreased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to activity in the company s stock compensation trust 
this trust is used to provide shares of the company s stock to meet its stock option plan obligations 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences that  in management s opinion  are more likely than not to be realized in the current or future periods 
the company s history of operating revenue and income growth  and expectation of future operating income  provides strong positive evidence that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain subsidiaries that are not deductible on a consolidated tax return 
management intends to continue to monitor the realizability of deferred tax assets in light of future circumstances and assess the reasonableness of the valuation allowance 
the company currently has access to total revolving credit facilities of million  which is used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   approximately million was drawn against these facilities 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company december in thousands cash and cash equivalents   short term investments   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   certain mamsi subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state insurance departments must notify state regulators before the payment of any dividends to mamsi and  in certain circumstances  must receive positive affirmation prior to such payment 
the company does not perceive these requirements to be a significant restriction on the subsidiaries ability to pay appropriate future dividends to the parent company 
the company does not anticipate any adverse impact on future liquidity due to medical malpractice issues because the company carries substantial professional liability insurance 
the company believes that cash generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned expanded operations 
certain capital expenditures will be made over the next year to enhance the company s computer systems  and to make necessary improvements to new and existing administrative offices 
in  the company began the process of identifying  evaluating and implementing changes to computer programs necessary to address the year issue 
this issue affects computer systems that have time sensitive programs that may not properly recognize the year this could result in major system failures or miscalculations 
the company is currently addressing its internal year issue with modifications to existing programs 
the company is also communicating with vendors  financial institutions  software vendors and others with which it conducts business to help them identify and resolve the year issue 
while the company has determined that certain of its software programs require modification  it does not anticipate any future material impact on its financial statements 
the total cost associated with the required modifications and conversions is not known at this time  however  it is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
the statements in the preceding paragraph regarding future effects of the year issue is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information for a description of risk factors 
at its february meeting  the board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program 
the company may purchase its stock on the open market  through block trades  or in private transactions over the next months 
the program may be discontinued at any time
