part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company is the world s leading integrated producer of titanium sponge and mill products and has the largest sales volume worldwide 
the company is the only integrated producer with major manufacturing facilities in both of the world s principal markets for titanium  the united states and europe 
the company estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of world sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were over of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in diverse new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive uses 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and cast products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip  extrusions  wire and castings 
the company believes it is a low cost producer of titanium sponge and melt products due in part to its economies of scale  manufacturing expertise and investment in technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like the company  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company believes that at least of the world s titanium sponge is produced by six companies 
the company intends to continue its focus on the following goals and objectives to change the traditional way business is conducted 

maximize the long term value of its core aerospace business by focusing on the company s basic strengths of sponge production  melting  forging and casting of various shapes of titanium products and by entering into strategic agreements with major titanium users to help mitigate cyclicality of the aerospace business 

invest in strategic alliances  including joint ventures  acquisitions and entreprenurial arrangements  as well as new markets  applications and products to help reduce dependence on the aerospace sector 

invest in technology  capacity and innovative projects aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity  quality  customer service and production capacity 

stabilize the cost and supply of raw materials 

maintain a strong balance sheet 
timet has taken a number of recent actions to further these objectives including the items discussed below 
the company has an agreement with the boeing company under which timet will be the principal supplier of titanium products to boeing commercial airplane group boeing  and its family of suppliers for a year period beginning in the boeing agreement 
this innovative agreement with the world s largest end user of titanium provides timet with a significantly higher market share of boeing titanium requirements than it might otherwise have and should help mitigate cyclical fluctuations in aerospace prices and volumes 
see markets and customer base 
in order to meet the expected volume increases as a result of the boeing agreement  the company is adding additional melting and forging capacity intended to be cost effective even in a market downturn 
these capacity additions are generally expected to be completed during the second half of timet has also entered into a long term agreement to purchase  beginning in  titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to help stabilize both cost and supply of this raw material 
see raw materials 
in  the company combined its us welded tube operations with those of valinox welded  a french manufacturer of welded tubing  principally stainless steel and titanium  with operations in france and china 
the joint venture  valtimet  is owned by timet and owned by valinox welded a subsidiary of vallourec 
the joint venture is intended to combine best manufacturing practices and market coverage 
timet is the principal supplier of titanium to valtimet 
the company has agreed to acquire for cash the titanium business of loterios spa  one of italy s largest fabricators and distributors of titanium products  with sales of approximately million 
loterios has emerged in recent years as one of the premier producers and suppliers of titanium pipe and fittings to the offshore oil and gas drilling and productions markets and is the leading supplier of these products in the north sea offshore market 
the acquisition of loterios  scheduled to close in april  is expected to increase timet s market share in industrial markets and to provide increased geographic sales coverage 
timet s strategy for investing in new markets and uses for titanium also includes investing in emerging businesses 
in this regard  during the company acquired equity interests in ti 
pro  llc  titanium memory systems  inc tms and ticomp  inc ti 
pro s focus is on developing the market for titanium in automobile racing and other specialty vehicle applications  tms is engaged in development and production of a titanium substrate for use in computer hard disk drives  and ticomp is working on the development and production of layered titanium and composite materials for a variety of potential applications 
acquisitions and capital transactions during at the beginning of  the company was owned by tremont corporation and its operations were conducted primarily in the united states 
during  among other things  the company expanded both geographically and operationally as a result of the acquisition of the titanium business of imi plc the imi titanium acquisition  the acquisition of certain assets from axel johnson metals  inc the ajm acquisition and certain smaller acquisitions in europe  all of which transactions are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also significantly improved its liquidity and capital structure during through its initial public offering of common stock which included sales by some of its shareholders and the issuance of company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities the convertible preferred securities through a subsidiary trust  timet capital trust i 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
tremont now holds approximately of timet s outstanding common stock

recent industry conditions 
the titanium industry historically has derived the majority of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the historical fluctuations in performance of titanium companies and contributed to cyclical peaks in titanium mill product shipments in and and cyclical lows in and the titanium industry improved dramatically during the last three years due to a combination of factors  including a resurgence in commercial aerospace demand beginning in  continuing and stable industrial demand and the emergence of new uses for titanium in diverse sectors such as military armor and consumer goods 
worldwide industry mill product shipments increased in each of the last three years 
industry shipments of approximately  metric tons in were above levels 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components such as rotor blades  discs  rings and engine cases  and air frame components  such as bulkheads  tail sections and wing supports  can be separated into commercial and military sectors 
industry shipments to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of total aerospace demand of total industry wide titanium demand 
according to the airline monitor  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of over billion estimated in  up one third from billion in  and substantially better than profitability levels of and and the significant losses during to despite recent aircraft deferrals and cancellations by some asian airlines  most major carriers are believed to be continuing to invest in upgrading and expanding their fleets 
the company understands commercial aircraft producers carry record backlogs with deliveries not expected to peak until in addition  current generations of airplanes use substantially more titanium than their predecessors 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will result in demand for titanium products 
since titanium s initial application in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
existing industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities and automotive uses 
several of these emerging applications represent potential growth opportunities that the company believes may reduce the industry s historical dependence on the aerospace market 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and cast products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip  extrusions  wire and castings 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
a portion of the company s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nevada  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
the balance of the company s sponge production capacity uses a leaching process rather than distillation to remove residues 
titanium ingots and slab are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for most finished titanium products 
timet closely monitors the melting process for ingots and slabs utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and meet customer specifications 
titanium mill products result from forging  rolling  drawing and or extruding titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip and extrusions 
the company sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to the company s service centers 
the company s customers usually process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
titanium cast products are produced by remelting ingot or billet and pouring molten metal into a cast  the cavity of which has been created in the shape of the part to be produced 
after the metal has cooled and solidified  the part is removed from the cast and delivered to the customer or a third party for finishing 
the casting process provides significant flexibility in the shapes that can be produced and is frequently utilized in forming tolerance critical components such as diffusers  fan frames  seal rings  fluid system components and missile components 
during the production process and following the completion of products  the company performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  mill products and castings 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing  ultrasonic and x ray testing  and dye penetration testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
the company is dependent upon the services of outside processors to perform important processing functions with respect to certain of its products 
in particular  the company currently relies upon a single processor to perform certain rolling steps for some of its plate  sheet  and strip products  and upon a single processor to perform certain finishing and conditioning steps for its slab products 
although the company believes that there are other metal processors with the capability to perform these same functions  arranging for alternative processors or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
the company is exploring ways to lessen its dependence on any individual processor 
in approximately of the company s sales were generated from the sale of titanium ingot  slab  a wide variety of mill products and sponge  was generated from titanium castings  and the balance from sales of titanium tetrachloride and other by products 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill and cast products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying materials 
the company is the only domestic integrated titanium products producer that processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
as a result  the company is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market price of titanium sponge than its competitors 
in  the company produced  metric tons of sponge  of which approximately was sold pursuant to a long term agreement with the remainder used internally 
while the company is one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge  under current market conditions it cannot supply all of its needs for titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a portion of its sponge needs approximately one half in 
the company obtains sponge from suppliers in japan and the former soviet union fsu  both on a spot purchase basis and pursuant to fixed price contracts 
timet has entered into a long term agreement for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan 
the sponge purchase agreement is for ten years beginning in  with firm pricing for the first five years subject to certain adjustments 
volumes purchased under the contract will be up to  metric tons annually 
the company expects to have annual contracts with other sponge suppliers which it believes will cover the balance of its needs 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  africa south africa and sierra leone  india and the united states 
a majority of the company s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company obtains its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
in addition  although the company believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single source near the company s henderson  nevada plant  but alternative suppliers are available 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
the company has long term agreements with certain suppliers for a substantial portion of its alloy requirements at fixed and or formula determined prices 
markets and customer base 
about of the company s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to customers in other regions 
no single customer represents more than of the company s direct sales 
however  in  about of the company s sales were used by the company s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
the company expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace sector  industrial and consumer goods markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the aerospace industry is dominated by two major manufacturers of commercial aircraft and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines 
typically  the company s sales are not made directly to the major aircraft and engine manufacturers but rather to companies that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
however  if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce build rates  there could be a material adverse effect on certain of the company s direct customers who supply to such manufacturer and  therefore  an indirect adverse effect on the company 
the company entered into the boeing agreement to help mitigate the impact of aerospace cyclicality 
under the terms of the boeing agreement  timet will supply a minimum of of boeing s annual needs for titanium  depending upon boeing s requirements each year 
timet s share of boeing s total titanium requirements will increase as boeing s volume requirements decrease  down to a minimum mutual commitment of million pounds  metric tons per year 
the agreement is effective for shipments beginning in  but it is not anticipated to reach expected volume levels until pricing under the boeing agreement is firm for the first five years and will be reviewed annually for inflationary conditions for the next five years based upon an aerospace related index 
the companies have also agreed to utilize boeing s lean manufacturing program to develop cost savings that will be shared by both companies 
the company may also enter into similar long term agreements with other key aerospace customers 
the company s order backlog was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  approximately of the year end backlog is expected to be delivered during although the company believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect the company s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing including mcdonnell douglas and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of  an increase of in following a increase in the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to at the end of and at the end of growth in firm order backlog for narrow body aircraft increased during and in  to  at the end of the year 
through various strategic relationships  the company seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  fsu and china 
the company is one of four integrated producers in the world 
the company regards firms that produce at least both sponge and ingot as integrated producers 
a number of non integrated producers exist that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
the company believes that us  european and japanese producers are generally operating near practical capacity levels while some unused capacity is available in the fsu 
the company s principal competitors include oregon metallurgical corporation oremet and allegheny teledyne  inc which have proposed to combine and rmi titanium company 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of the increased availability of imports by purchasing sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products for use in its own operations  the negative effect of increased imports on the company has been somewhat diminished 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
starting in  imports of titanium mill products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
in recent years  the gsp program has been subject to annual review and renewal and is currently scheduled to expire in june in  gsp benefits to russian products were suspended when the level of imports of russian mill products reached of all us imports of titanium mill products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products 
in addition  a petition has also been filed to bring titanium sponge and ingot under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
the company believes these petitions are likely to be acted upon during the second quarter of in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from russia  kazakhstan  and ukraine has for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
however  beginning in these antidumping duties were significantly reduced  and in one case eliminated altogether  for the two principal importers of russian sponge into the us regular annual reviews to assess the appropriate level of antidumping duties with respect to titanium sponge from russia and kazakhstan are currently underway 
in march  the united states international trade commission itc initiated a changed circumstances review of the antidumping duty orders on titanium sponge from the fsu and japan in order to determine whether revocation of the orders would result in a recurrence of material injury to the untied states titanium sponge industry 
if the itc determines that injury would not recur  the orders will be revoked in july in addition  proceedings will begin in to evaluate the continuation generally of all outstanding us antidumping orders  including those covering titanium sponge 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
however  the company has  in recent years  been one of the largest importers of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent the company remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to the company for these products to the extent the company currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to produce titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in certain applications 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward improving process technology  developing new alloys  enhancing the performance of the company s products in current applications  and searching for new uses of titanium products 
for example  one of the company s proprietary alloys  timetal r s  has been specified for a number of aerospace applications including the boeing additionally  timetal lcb  a new low cost beta alloy  is being tested for new non aerospace applications  and timetal has been introduced into the sporting goods markets 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its nevada laboratory  which the company believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton  england facility 
the company s research and development expenditures approximated million in  up from million during each of the two prior years  and are expected to be million to million in patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually evaluates whether patent protection with respect to its technical base is advisable and in the past has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
the company believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
as of december   the company employed approximately  persons in the us and approximately persons in europe  up from a total of  at the end of the company s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
employees at the company s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in february  employees at timet castings albany  oregon facility voted to not be represented by the uswa 
substantially all of the salaried and hourly employees at the company s european facilities are covered by collectively bargained labor agreements 
in january  new one year agreements covering the uk and french union employees were entered into  providing for modest wage increases in the uswa engaged in a nine month work stoppage at the company s henderson facility in and in a three month stoppage at the toronto facility in while the company currently has long term contracts with the uswa and considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
the company s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the federal clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at the company s henderson  nevada facility  the company uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
the company has used such substances during substantially the entire history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in the company s operations 
the company s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws are generally less stringent than us laws and which have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that such foreign laws will not become more stringent 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker safety laws 
the company s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental performance 
from time to time  the company may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties  but to date no material penalties have been incurred 
the company incurred capital expenditures for safety  environmental protection and compliance of approximately million in and its capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately two thirds of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
the company and the industry were significantly and adversely affected during the early s by excess worldwide production capacity  depressed levels of spending for both military and commercial aircraft  and depressed selling prices resulting from  among other things  weak demand and relatively inexpensive titanium scrap  sponge and other mill products  principally from the fsu 
the company estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products were relatively flat in the period between and  increased in  in and further increased in  to approximately  metric tons 
the company also estimates that industry mill product shipments to the commercial aerospace market in approximated  metric tons  a increase over levels following a increase in the company s order backlog increased to approximately million at december   from million at december  beginning in the second half of and continuing through  the company experienced a significant increase in requests for quotations  increased orders and increased prices on accepted orders resulting in an increase in average mill product prices of in following a increase in prices for have generally flattened  in part due to the price stabilizing influence of the boeing agreement 
growth in the company s earnings over the next few years is expected to be primarily dependent upon volume increases and productivity improvements rather than higher prices 
the company expects to operate its plants at or near practical capacity in due to the volume increases that the company expects as a result of the boeing agreement  expected continued growth in industrial markets and emerging uses of titanium  the company is adding additional melting and forging capacity during that should be more cost effective than certain present capacity and would replace existing equipment in the event of a downturn 
while aircraft production rates and backlogs appear to indicate a longer  flatter aerospace cycle than previous cycles  the company believes that customers have built inventories based on expected further increases in aircraft production rates that were later modified 
as a result  the company believes there is some excess titanium in the aerospace production system that could result in push out of some shipments to customers and some order cancellations as customers adjust their inventories in the short term 
certain current initiatives to invest in the company s future are expected to result in higher expenses in  with benefits not fully realized until or beyond 
spending in for research and development  other corporate development activities related to development of new markets and expenses related to the company s enterprise wide business process information systems sap project and related upgrade of information technology infrastructure are expected to be higher than in as a result of certain systems being designed to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain of timet s information and manufacturing systems have date sensitive software and hardware that may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could result in system failures or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of manufacturing or other normal business activities 
many of timet s information systems are being replaced in connection with the implementation of sap which is expected to be completed in sap is year compliant 
timet is in process of expediting its remaining portfolios of non compliant software and hardware and expects to complete this process in the company s preliminarily estimates that the costs  excluding the implementation of sap  to address the year issue could be over million  which is expected to be incurred primarily from mid through mid sales and operating income all mill products price and volume comparisons in this discussion are pro forma assuming the imi titanium acquisition and the ajm acquisition  both completed during  had occurred at the beginning of the pro forma effect of other acquisitions on price and volume information is not material 
the significant improvements in sales  operating income and operating margins in over and in over were driven by price and volume increases for titanium products in both commercial aerospace and other markets 
sales volume of titanium mill products increased in  to approximately  metric tons  following a increase in average selling prices in were approximately over  which were up approximately over the selling price increases reflect both the pass through of cost increases  particularly raw material costs  and real price improvement associated with increased market demand 
operating levels at the company s plants in both and were generally higher than in the respective prior year and contributed to the improved operating results 
the vdp titanium sponge plant operated at approximately of its annual practical capacity in both and and in the company restarted production of titanium sponge at its original kroll leach facility during the second quarter of in response to demand for certain grades of titanium sponge  and further increased production levels in in  the company s worldwide mill product capacity utilization approximated  up from in and in operating income in included a special charge of million and in included a restructuring credit of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom 
the us dollar value of the company s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may slightly impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
approximately one half of the company s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally major european currencies 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge  for the company s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
interest expense interest expense declined in both and principally due to relative average borrowing levels 
minority interest annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million  including amortization of financing costs  and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by cezus 
income taxes the company s income tax rate in and varied from the us statutory rate principally due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes and  in  a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from a change in estimate of the net operating loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax carryforwards that would more likely than not be realized in the future 
the company s effective income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate due primarily to losses for which recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate at the time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
for financial reporting purposes  the company has recognized substantially all of its carryforwards and  accordingly  expects that its effective income tax rate beginning in will increase and more closely approximate the us federal statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million of cash and equivalents and million of borrowing availability under its us and european bank credit lines 
indebtedness consisted primarily of capital lease obligations related to certain of its european manufacturing facilities and a relatively nominal amount of european working capital borrowings 
the convertible preferred securities do not require principal amortization and the company has the right to defer interest payments for one or more periods of up to consecutive quarters 
operating activities 
reflecting improved operating results  cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities was million in compared to million in and million in changes in assets and liabilities used million of cash in  million in and million in reflecting the higher levels of working capital necessary to support the higher production and sales levels 
one of the company s goals is to better manage working capital such that both days sales outstanding in receivables and days sales in inventory improve in over investing activities 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  up from million in and million in about one third of capital expenditures in relate to capacity expansion projects  the largest of which include a  metric ton annual capacity electron beam furnace in the us and a rotary forge press in the us  both to be completed by the second half of capital spending in related to the major sap project to implement integrated information systems throughout the company  expected to be completed in  approximated million 
certain significant costs associated with the sap systems project  including training and reengineering  are expensed as incurred 
the companies acquired during accounted for million of the million increase in capital spending over  with much of the remaining increase resulting from projects deferred in prior years 
the company estimates capital expenditures in will total million to million  approximately of which is related to the capacity expansion projects associated with volume expected under long term customer agreements 
in addition  the million loterios acquisition is expected to close in april other cash investments in include million of cash contributions in connection with the formation of valtimet and otherwise consist principally of the company s investments in companies developing new markets and uses for titanium 
acquisitions  principally the imi titanium acquisition and ajm acquisition  aggregated million in million cash  million stock 
the company believes these acquisitions augmented the company s scale and geographic reach and increased its production flexibility 
in addition  the acquisition of the scrap processing business acquired in the ajm acquisition enhanced the company s flexibility in optimizing its mix of its raw material purchases 
financing activities 
debt repayments in relate primarily to reductions in european working capital borrowings  including amounts due to timet s minority partner in timet savoie 
the company s net proceeds from the initial public offering in june approximated million 
the company used approximately million of such net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the convertible preferred securities by timet capital trust i in november the company used approximately million of such net proceeds to prepay indebtedness incurred in conjunction with the ajm acquisition 
reductions of indebtedness in included installments on bank term debt and payment of the final installment due on the note associated with the company s purchase of its original interest in tht in the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its alternative uses of capital  its debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital  and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  incur  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase shares of capital stock  sell assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company investigates  evaluates  discusses and engages in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and related industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  the company may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness
