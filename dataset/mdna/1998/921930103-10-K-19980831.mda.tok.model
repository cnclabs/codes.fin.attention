sfas nos 
and are effective for the company as of june  the company believes the adoption of sfas nos 
and will not significantly affect the company s financial statement presentation

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting for derivative and hedging activities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet determined the impact of adopting this new standard on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company will adopt sop effective in the adoption of sop will require the company to modify its method of accounting for software

seasonality historically  the company s business has been moderately seasonal  with the largest percentage of sales realized in the first fiscal quarter june through august  the so called back to school months 
in addition  because snowboarding is a winter sport  sales of the company s snowboard boots  and switch s autolock step in boot binding system  have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
as the company increases its international sales and experiences changes in product mix  it believes that future quarterly results may vary from historical trends 
in addition to seasonal fluctuations  the company s operating results fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of holidays  weather  timing of shipments  product mix  cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels 
because of such fluctuations  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts 
year compliance the company is dependent upon complex information technology it systems for many phases of its operations  including production  sales  distribution and delivery 
many existing it programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year ie  read the year as the year issue 
the company has commenced a program intended to timely identify  mitigate and or prevent the adverse effects of the year issue through an analysis of its own it systems and non it systems  and pursue year compliance by its vendors  creditors and financial service organizations 
the company has completed the analysis of its it system and has received certifications of year compliance from its it systems vendors 
the company is still analyzing its non it systems for year compliance and expects to complete substantially all of such analysis by the end of with respect to third party vendors  creditors and financial services organizations  the company has identified over such third parties who the company believes are material to its business 
the company has inquired as to the year readiness of each of such parties and has sought certifications of year compliance from them 
to date  the company has received responses from approximately of such third parties which indicate either year compliance or that they have instituted programs to assure such compliance 
the company is pursuing answers from all third parties who have  to date  failed to respond to the company s inquiries 
the company expects to receive substantially all of such answers by the end of since the company has not completed the data gathering phase of its year compliance program  it cannot yet quantify the costs  if any  that may be required to fix the year issue or any losses to the company which might result therefrom 
however  to date  the company has not incurred any material expenses on fixing the year issue or experienced any losses therefrom 
in the event the company discovers that either internal it or non it systems or the systems of key third party vendors  creditors or financial service organizations will not be year compliant  the company will either obtain alternative it systems that are year compliant or systems that do not rely on computers  and  in the case of third parties  switch to other vendors which have year compliant systems 
the company intends to develop a more specific contingency plan upon completion of the data gathering phase of its compliance program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable 
these are forward looking statements regarding the completion date of the data gathering phase of the company s year compliance program 
the actual date of completion may be different depending on a number of important factors  including but not limited to i the complexity of the analyses needed to determine year compliance for non it systems embedded in items such as machinery and equipment  and ii the level of cooperation the company receives from third parties with respect to its compliance inquiries
