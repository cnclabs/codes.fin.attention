the growth in sales from to is primarily the result of the company increasing its production capacity and the expansion of the electronic components industry 
this expansion has been due primarily to the growth of computer  telecommunications and automotive manufacturers usage of passive electronic components  as the use of electronics in all walks of life become more widespread and sophisticated 
during this period of growth in the industry  the average selling prices of electronic components  as well as the selling prices of the end use products which rely on passive components  have declined 
in order to lower the costs of production  the company continues to increase automation of its manufacturing processes and transfer certain labor intensive manufacturing processes from countries with high labor costs to lower labor cost areas such as the czech republic  el salvador  and mexico

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs having time sensitive software would recognize a date using as the year rather than the year based on a recent assessment of the company s date sensitive systems  the company has determined that certain systems will need to be updated  replaced or modified 
this will be accomplished through software vendors and internal resources 
the company does not expect any material cost to be incurred as a result of these modifications or any significant disruption to its operations
