overview the company was incorporated in to develop  manufacture and market innovative manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry  and shipped its first product  a spin rinser dryer  that year 
during the s  the company introduced several generations of its acid and solvent spray surface preparation and cleaning tools and vertical furnaces  and began to market its products to manufacturers outside the semiconductor industry 
since  the company has developed its single substrate surface preparation and cleaning system  its storm wafer carrier cleaning system  and its automated multi module surface preparation processing system 
the company also developed the high throughput production ready copper plating tool  the lt c 
the unit selling prices for the company s products range from  to  for a spin rinser dryer  to  to over million for the magnum and ecd tools 
due to these relatively high unit selling prices  a significant portion of the company s revenue in any given period is often derived from the sale of a relatively small number of units 
from time to time  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its results of operations  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet expectations  operating results will be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the company s operating results in a particular period 
these factors include specific economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  customer cancellations or delays of shipments  specific feature requests by customers  production delays or manufacturing inefficiencies  management decisions to commence or discontinue product lines  the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the introduction of new products by the company or its competition  the selection of the company s or its competitors products by semiconductor manufacturers for new generations of fabrication facilities  the timing of research and development expenditures  exchange rate fluctuations  and expenses attendant to acquisitions  strategic alliances and the further development of marketing and service capabilities 
the company markets and sells its products worldwide with an emphasis on europe and asia as its principal international markets 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage of international sales may fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes its sales  service and support organizations are important to the long term success of its customer relationships 
the company provides sales  service and support worldwide  primarily through direct employees in the united states  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan  and through distributors elsewhere in the world 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s results of operations for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended september  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended september  and net sales 
net sales consists of revenues from sales of equipment  spare parts and service  and fab supervisory systems 
net sales decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales in surface preparation and cleaning  and thermal products was partially offset by increased sales in electrochemical deposition products  spare parts and service  and fab supervisory control systems 
electrochemical deposition sales for fiscal  were million  up from million in the prior fiscal year 
essentially all of the sales increase in electrochemical deposition products was provided by sales of tools for copper plating applications 
the overall sales decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of capital equipment spending by the company s customers in response to the semiconductor industry downturn driven by excess capacity and the asian economic decline 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
orders backlog decreased nearly to million at september   from approximately million at september  the company includes in its backlog those customer orders for which it has received purchase orders or purchase order numbers and for which shipment is scheduled within the next twelve months 
orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalty 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery schedules  cancellations of orders and delays in product shipments  the company s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
the continuing market weakness and the low orders backlog level at the beginning of fiscal  limits the company s visibility into fiscal  however  the company will likely have substantially lower sales and possibly a net loss for the year 
gross profit 
gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin is attributable to a number of factors including improved efficiencies earlier in the year which were partially offset later in the year by excess capacity costs  lower material costs and sales mix 
the company s gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the cost to manufacture  service  and support new and enhanced products  as well as the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
the company anticipates that the cost to manufacture and support newer tool models will improve over time  but that it will continue to design and sell additional models of its existing tools and additional tool types  which may offset in part the anticipated improvement 
gross profit margins declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to be under downward pressure in fiscal as a result of excess capacity 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
the million increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects the full year effect of the company s decision to transition to a company staffed sales and customer support organization in the asian marketplace  the larger domestic and european customer service organization  and a fourth quarter million bad debt provision for an international receivable 
a substantial portion of the company s sg a expense is fixed in the short term  however  the company expects it s sg a expenses to decrease in fiscal research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with the company s research and development efforts 
r d expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
spending on r d increased or million in absolute dollars over the prior year due to the number and complexity of projects undertaken 
major projects during the year include development of the lt c linear copper plating tool  the development of the high throughput fully automated spectrum  and the millennium platform with its unique capsule chamber 
the hydrozone cleaning process was also developed during fiscal the company is committed to technology leadership in the semiconductor equipment industry and expects to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multiyear perspective 
such funding has resulted in fluctuations in r d expenses from period to period in the past 
the company expects such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
other income expense 
interest income on short term investments declined from  in fiscal to  in interest expense increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal due to additional debt related to the building purchased for rhetech 
other expense in fiscal also includes a  write off of capitalized costs associated with a canceled building project 
provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
years ended september  and net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from sales of equipment  spare parts and service contracts 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of the company s automated batch chemical processing tools accounted for the majority of the increase 
the company shipped a number of new tool models during the first wafer batch size magnum with a newly designed work in process wip station was delivered during the fiscal year 
new versions of magnum also include vision systems to guide the robotics and an ozone injection system designed to decrease operating expenses and enhance performance 
in addition to our own proprietary  newly designed model based temperature controller which decreases cycle time  the express furnace received new robotics and a fully standard mechanical interface smif compatible wip station 
the adoption of any of these tools for future widespread production use is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  performance and pricing competition from other equipment manufacturers 
international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the company s gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the costs to manufacture  service and support new and enhanced products  as well as the mix and average selling prices of products sold 
the company believes that the largest single factor in the gross margin decline is costs and inefficiencies related to recently developed products 
the company anticipates that the cost to manufacture and support the newer tool models will improve over time  but that it will continue to design and sell additional models of its existing tools and additional tool types  which may somewhat offset the anticipated improvement in gross margins 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
the million increase in sg a expense in as compared to reflects higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  a broader range of equipment to market and service  and costs associated with additional sales and service personnel supporting the domestic and asian marketplaces 
a substantial portion of the company s sg a expense is fixed in the short term 
while it is the company s goal to reduce sg a expense as a percentage of net sales during periods of rising sales  a decline in net sales would cause the company s selling  general and administrative expense to increase as a percentage of net sales and could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with the company s research and development efforts 
r d expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in the prior year 
major projects during the year include development of the equinox lt linear copper plating tool and the completion of development of the mm magnum and mm express products 
spending on r d increased or million in absolute dollars over the prior year due to the number and complexity of projects undertaken 
the company is committed to technology leadership in the semiconductor equipment industry and expects to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multiyear perspective 
such funding has resulted in fluctuations in r d expenses from period to period in the past 
the company expects such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net sales 
other income expense 
interest income on short term investments declined from  in fiscal to  in provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes for and were million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth since its february initial public offering primarily through amounts raised in conjunction with that offering  operations and borrowings on its revolving line of credit 
cash generated by operating activities in fiscal was million as compared to million generated by operations in fiscal substantial reductions in accounts receivable and inventory  and increases in non cash expenses in offset the decline in accounts payable and net income 
as of september   the company had million of accounts receivable and million of inventory  compared to million of accounts receivable and million of inventory at september  as is customary in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  products are generally built to fill specific customer orders  with typical order fulfillment times ranging from four to six weeks for certain products to six months or more for more complex products 
accordingly  while the company s finished goods inventory accounts for slightly over of total inventory  overall inventory levels tend to fluctuate with the level and type of orders received 
currently  the tools with the longest average cycle times are the automated batch chemical tools and the single substrate processor 
the company expects future receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions of property and equipment and intangible assets in fiscal property and equipment purchases used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal major purchases of plant  property and equipment during the year include the purchase of a building site for semy engineering  the purchase of an airplane  purchase of land adjacent to the company s cambridge  england site  the purchase of land and building for rhetech  and increases in lab equipment which includes the purchase of a fixed ion beam microscope 
investments in intangible assets used cash of million in fiscal and consisted of million for fab supervisory systems software development costs which were capitalized once technological feasibility was reached and  for patents and trademarks financing activities consisted primarily of million in new financing related to the purchase of the land and building to house rhetech  and  in new debt related to the land purchased in cambridge  england 
as of september   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million available under the company s million revolving line of credit  which was renewed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit facility is with seafirst bank and bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate 
the revolving line of credit expires on april  and all principal amounts owing are due by april  the revolving line of credit agreement has various restrictive covenants  including a prohibition against pledging or in any way encumbering current or operating assets during the term of the agreement and the maintenance of various financial ratios 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  and funds available under its bank lines will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital requirements during the next twelve months including the spending of approximately million to purchase property  plant and equipment 
the company believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may effect additional equity or debt financings to fund such activities or to fund greater than anticipated growth 
the sale of additional equity securities or the issuance of equity securities in a business combination could result in dilution to the company s shareholders

year the company s year yk readiness project is well underway 
the project consists of six major phases planning completed july assessment completed october testing in progress  scheduled to be completed march repairs reinstallations in progress  scheduled to be completed march retesting in progress  scheduled to be completed june contingency plans june october 
the planning phase has been completed and consisted of assigning resources and timelines to tasks with the projects scheduled to be complete by june the plan is updated as new information is collected 
the assessment phase has also been completed and consisted of taking an inventory of products  information technology it systems  non it systems  and customers suppliers that need to be tested and certified as to yk readiness 
products 
other than some spare parts  many of the company s products include software both internally developed and purchased from vendors 
some equipment also includes numerous sub systems with embedded software 
much of this software is customized to meet customers specific needs 
it system 
these systems include the company s business and manufacturing systems  computer aided design  e mail and others 
the majority of these systems were developed by software vendors  are not highly customized  and are either under a software maintenance agreement which requires the vendor to make the systems yk ready or have been updated to yk compliant revisions 
many of the systems have been certified by the manufacturer to be yk ready 
non it systems 
these systems include but are not limited to controllers on machinery used in production  the heating and air conditioning systems  communication systems  and electronic security devices 
we are working closely with suppliers of such systems to ensure their products work properly 
customers suppliers 
the company is working with its customers and suppliers to determine yk readiness to insure that goods and services will be delivered timely and that transaction processing is proper 
the company does have electronic data interface edi transactions with some customers  however  these edi transactions are provided by third parties who have certified their yk readiness 
the company is working with key vendors who supply yk sensitive products 
the assessment phase consisted of identifying which systems have potential yk problems and the possible affects of those problems 
the problems were then prioritized and those with the largest potential impact on operations were scheduled for early testing 
the company is currently in the testing phase with its it systems  non it systems  and its customers and suppliers 
the company is using test procedures developed by sematech  a consortium of semiconductor and semiconductor manufactures for its it systems 
this work is performed by the company s it personnel 
the non it systems and customers and suppliers testing is either done jointly or completely by the supplier 
as testing is completed  repairs reinstallations  and retesting will occur 
some of the company s equipment and the fab supervisory systems that it sells contain hardware and software components that are subject to the yk problems 
the company is currently in the testing  repairs reinstallation and retesting phases with its products 
all products shipped since april  are yk ready and most of the products shipped prior to that date have upgrades available or installed 
the installed upgrades have been retested 
the company will formulate contingency plans for those systems not yk ready by june of it is not anticipated the contingency plans will be needed for the mission critical it and non it systems  nor does the company expect that contingency plans will be needed for its internally developed software products 
it is not known at this point if contingency plans will be needed for customers suppliers and for outsourced components 
the cost incurred thus far with regard to yk consists mainly of it personnel payroll expenses for it  non it and customers suppliers issues 
software engineering payroll cost has been the primary expense related to yk products related issues 
the company does not track yk costs as a separate cost 
total estimated costs are not anticipated to exceed  due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the yk issue  the company cannot anticipate all of the possible problems that may occur 
adverse consequences from yk issues may materially affect the company s warranty liability  the value of its capitalized software and the carrying value of its inventory as well as the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the yk problems could also subject the company to litigation which may include consequential damages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity the company as of september  has approximately million in long term debt and approximately million in short term debt 
the company s long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate 
as a result  changes in the fixed rate interest market would change the estimated fair value of its fixed rate long term debt 
the company believes that a change in the long term interest rate would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or result of operations 
the company s short term debt bears interest at a variable rate 
based on the million of short term debt outstanding as of september   a change in interest rates would affect on the company s results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company conducts its japanese business in japanese yen 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily as an economic hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations of its japanese subsidiary 
these contracts are denominated in the japanese yen 
the maturities of the forward foreign exchange contracts are generally short term in nature 
the company s forward exchange contracts are marked to market as are the underlying transactions being hedged 
the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts generally offsets the related impact on anticipated transactions denominated in yen 
the effect of a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates on the japanese yen forward exchange contracts and the underlying transactions would not be material to the company s financial condition  results of operations or the cash flows 
in general  net foreign currency gains and losses have not been material
