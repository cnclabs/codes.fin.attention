the following table sets forth the sources of the company s revenues by customer type as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the three years ended august   and year ended august  dtca hospital contracts dtca managed care payor contracts other principal sources of revenues for dtca have been its operating contracts for hospital based diabetes treatment centers 
these centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services to this population 
the following table presents the number of dtca hospital contracts in effect and the number of hospital sites where dtca services were provided under the terms of these contracts or was in the process of initiating operations as of the end of fiscal years  and the number of hospital contracts and hospital sites for these periods includes two arthritis and osteoporosis care center aocc contracts with hospitals to provide comprehensive arthritis and osteoporosis services that are operated by dtca 
as of august  hospital contracts hospital sites where services are provided the components of changes to the total number of dtca hospital contracts and hospital sites under these contracts for fiscal years  and are presented below 
year ended august  hospital hospital hospital contracts sites contracts sites contracts sites total contracts sites at beginning of period new contracts sites signed contracts sites discontinued conversion of stand alone contract to multiple site contract total contracts sites at end of period during fiscal and  and contracts  respectively  were renewed for dtca hospital based diabetes treatment centers 
during fiscal  there will be hospital contracts which will reach the end of their terms unless renewed 
the company periodically renegotiates existing dtca hospital contracts and  in that connection  has historically agreed to reduce its fee structure in certain of these contracts in order to maintain favorable long term client relationships with these hospitals 
the company anticipates that it will continue to make such fee reductions or center contract restructurings which will have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
during fiscal  ten dtca hospital contracts were discontinued and during fiscal nine dtca hospital contracts were discontinued 
during fiscal and  three dtca contracts and eight dtca contracts  respectively  that were discontinued were with hospitals owned by columbia hca healthcare corporation columbia 
while dtca did renew one contract in fiscal and three contracts in fiscal with columbia hospitals  it believes that the majority of its seven contracts with columbia  as of august   will be discontinued over the next two years 
during fiscal  five dtca contracts with columbia hospitals will reach the end of their terms unless renewed 
while dtca s revenues historically have been generated primarily by its operating contracts with hospitals  dtca has also developed and is continuing to refine products which are designed to assist managed care payors in reducing the total costs and improving the quality of care for individuals with diabetes enrolled in their plans  and believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will result from healthcare management contracts with managed care payors 
implementation of dtca s first management contracts with managed care payors occurred in fiscal these diabetes population management products enable dtca to manage the total healthcare needs and or the specific diabetes care needs of populations of individuals with diabetes 
dtca believes that its intensive diabetes education  patient support and treatment regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  will assist in assuring that the most effective care is delivered at the lowest cost and that ultimately such intensive diabetes education  support and treatment efforts will reduce or prevent the devastating and costly complications of diabetes 
pursuant to dtca s diabetes population management contracts  dtca provides a core group of diabetes clinical and support staff that are responsible for coordinating and supporting the management of the treatment of individuals with diabetes in accordance with treatment standards and protocols that have been developed by dtca and have been approved by the medical leadership at each managed care plan 
the actual treatment of the individuals is provided by physicians and hospitals who are part of the payor s network of providers 
services provided under contracts for dtca s diabetes netcare tm product comprise its most comprehensive product offering and includes dtca professional staff on site at the hmo location to assist in the delivery of this service 
services provided under dtca s diabetes netlink tm product are provided telephonically and via mail by a team of diabetes treatment and support staff from a telephone center located in nashville  tennessee  and are designed primarily to improve blood glucose management for diabetes patients and to monitor and promote compliance with certain standards of care for diabetes patients and to support the case management activities of the hmo 
diabetes population management contracts require a sophisticated management information system to enable dtca to manage the care of large diabetes patient populations and to assist in reporting outcomes and costs 
the company has developed a clinical management system which it believes meets dtca s information management needs for its diabetes population management services and has installed and is utilizing the system for the enrollees of each of its managed care contract customers 
as of august   dtca had contracts with eight managed care payors to provide diabetes population disease management services to hmo markets 
the number of covered lives under management pursuant to these contracts for its diabetes netcare tm and its diabetes netlink tm products as of august   and is presented on the following table 
at august  covered lives under management netcare tm contracts   netlink tm contracts  total covered lives under management   in addition  covered lives at august  excludes  netcare tm contract lives and  netlink tm contract lives under existing contracts that are scheduled for implementation subsequent to august  during fiscal  dtca s managed care operations reduced the company s pretax profitability by approximately million 
this negative impact resulted primarily from initial operating losses for the new managed care payor contracts signed by dtca at the end of fiscal and during fiscal together with the overhead costs related to these contracts and from the costs associated with marketing efforts to enter into additional disease management contracts 
while dtca s managed care operations for all of fiscal reduced the company s pretax profitability by approximately million  this operation began contributing to overall dtca profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that its managed care operations will contribute to dtca s profitability during fiscal the company s initial managed care contracts for diabetes population management services that were entered into during fiscal and fiscal were shared savings diabetes netcare tm contracts with initial terms of five years 
health care cost savings resulting from the company s programs at these hmo sites were shared with the hmo according to ratios set forth in the respective contracts 
under these arrangements  dtca was at risk for the costs of operating its program and the hmos were at risk for of their members healthcare costs 
because of expected ramp up periods to generate cost savings and the time lag in calculating cost savings  dtca s profitability was negatively affected during the first to months of operation at each site 
during fiscal all new diabetes netcare tm and diabetes netlink tm contracts signed with managed care payors were based on per member per month payments to dtca for the hmo s enrollees who have diabetes and participate in dtca s programs 
in most of these contracts  individuals with diabetes in these plans are automatically enrolled in dtca s program but are permitted to decline to participate 
these contracts were generally for terms of three years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provided that between and of the per member per month fee is at risk subject to dtca s performance against clinical and financial cost savings criteria 
the structures of the managed care contracts signed during fiscal significantly reduced or eliminated the start up losses that have been experienced under the managed care contracts signed during fiscal and in addition  during fiscal all managed care contracts signed during fiscal and were converted to per member per month structures similar to those signed in fiscal or were terminated as part of a mutual agreement reached with coventry healthcare to discontinue six diabetes netcare tm site operations at principal healthcare hmos acquired by coventry healthcare during fiscal consequently  as of august   dtca does not have any shared savings contracts with managed care payors for its diabetes population management products 
as a result of the mutual agreement to terminate the coventry healthcare contracts in july  the company recorded additional revenue of approximately million associated with this settlement and also recorded additional costs of million associated with the termination of services at these locations 
the resulting pretax profit of approximately million from this settlement was recognized during the company s fourth fiscal quarter of the company s growth strategy is primarily to develop additional relationships with managed care payors responsible for the healthcare costs of individuals with diabetes and to further develop and expand its hospital based diabetes treatment center business 
in addition  the company has begun evaluating opportunities to develop or acquire capabilities in chronic disease management areas other than diabetes 
the company believes that the healthcare payor market is recognizing the potential cost savings and improved outcome benefits of chronic disease management programs  including diabetes population management services 
the company also believes that its position as the leading provider of diabetes treatment services to hospitals and physicians  as well as the positive clinical and financial results it has produced at its initial managed care contracts  will be an advantage in comparison with other potential competitors and with payors who are considering developing and providing such services themselves but who have no actual large scale diabetes population disease management experience 
in november  the company received an administrative subpoena for documents from a regional office of the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health and human services in connection with an investigation of dtca under certain federal medicare and medicaid statutes 
on february   the company learned that the federal government had declined to take over and pursue a civil whistle blower action brought under seal in june on behalf of the government by a former employee dismissed by the company in february the company believes that this lawsuit triggered the oig investigation 
the civil suit was filed in june against the company  dtca  and certain named and unnamed medical directors and client hospitals and was kept under seal to permit the government to determine whether to take over the lawsuit 
following its review  the government made the determination not to take over the litigation  and the complaint was unsealed on february  various preliminary motions have been filed regarding jurisdictional and pleading matters  resulting in the filing of a number of amended complaints and the dismissal of the company as a defendant 
dtca continues to be a defendant 
all of these preliminary motions have now been resolved and the lawsuit is now in the discovery stage 
the company has cooperated fully with the oig in its investigation  and believes that its operations have been conducted in full compliance with applicable statutory requirements 
although there can be no assurance that the existence of  or the results of  the investigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company  the company believes that the resolution of issues  if any  which may be raised by the government and the resolution of the civil litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations except to the extent that the company incurs material legal expenses associated with its defense of this matter and the civil suit 
year compliance plan historically  many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the program failing to properly recognize a year that begins with instead of potential system failures or miscalculations are generally referred to as year issues 
while the company s business does not involve the sale of computer services or medical equipment that might be affected by year compliance  the company does make extensive use of information technologies to support its operations 
in particular  the company s managed care operations are structured around its electronic medical record capability and various data interchange capabilities with its managed care customers 
the underlying electronic medical record system upon which the company s propriety standards of care are built is licensed from an outside software company 
the company has initiated an extensive effort to address year compliance and has engaged a major national healthcare consulting company to assist in the development and implementation of this plan 
this year project addresses software applications  information technology hardware  other infrastructure and customer and other third party relationships and data exchanges 
the structured approach of this project includes compiling an inventory of affected technology  systems and processes  assessing year compliance for critical components of the company s operations and selection of appropriate remediation efforts where required  remediating  converting or replacing each critical non compliant component  testing each critical component for compliance  and implementing remediated and tested components 
because the company is highly dependent  particularly in its managed care operations  on the ability of its customers to provide dtca with enrollment  claims and other data which is utilized by the company to provide services under its contracted service agreements  the year project also includes activities related to coordinating and  in some cases  testing compliance of key data exchange systems with the company s customers 
as of november   the company has completed the inventory phase of its year project 
in addition  the company has identified the electronic medical record utilized in its managed care operations as its primary mission critical component and has recently initiated a planned upgrade of this software capability to a version of the base electronic medical record that the third party provider of this platform represents as year compliant 
this conversion will position the company to realize significant operating enhancements for the system in addition to year compliance 
pursuant to its year project plan  the company expects to have addressed all of its mission critical systems and processes for year compliance by august  some non critical systems may not be addressed until after that date or until after january  however  the company believes that the potential failure of some or all of these non critical systems does not pose a material threat to its operations 
the company believes that it will incur up to  in operating expenditures  which represents approximately to of the company s information technology operating budget for the fiscal year ending august   to support the year project through completion 
this estimate is based on presently available information and will be updated as the company continues its assessment and proceeds with implementation of the year project 
most of these expenditures will be made during the year ended august  and there were no material expenditures related specifically to year issues incurred during the year ended august  in addition  the company expects that there may be limited amounts of equipment and infrastructure capital expenditures that will be accelerated because of year compliance issues 
however  because the majority of its information technology and infrastructure capital expenditures for its managed care operations have been made within the last two years and primarily have included equipment which the company believes will prove to be year compliant  the company currently anticipates that accelerated capital expenditures because of year issues will be less than  the company also anticipates that a primary focus of its managed care information technology system development resources throughout fiscal will be directed toward year compliance efforts 
the company also believes that it has the resources and capabilities to support current customer information technology needs and also believes that its ability to add new managed care business and hospital center business will not be negatively impacted by its year efforts 
while the company believes that it has the resources and the capabilities to adequately address year compliance  if the company s unique proprietary medical record application cannot be made year compliant  or if the data exchanges between the company and its managed care customers cannot be made year compliant because of failure of the company s or a customer s system or a supplier s system on which the company relies  there can be no assurances that these failures would not have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
the company has not yet established a contingency plan to address any such failures but intends to formulate plans to address unavoided or unavoidable risks and expects to have the contingency plans formulated by august results of operations the continuing operations of the company represents the results of operations of dtca and the corporate costs of american healthcorp  inc included in the results from discontinued operations are charges to amsurg for general management  administrative and accounting services provided by the company 
charges to amsurg for such services approximated the company s cost 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues for from resulted from improved performance under dtca s shared savings managed care contracts for diabetes population management services  an increase in the average number of lives enrolled in dtca s diabetes population management contracts to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as well as from million of revenue in fiscal resulting from the settlement with coventry healthcare terminating diabetes population management contracts at six hmo sites covering approximately  enrolled lives effective july  these increases in managed care payor contract revenues were offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital treatment center contracts resulting from a decrease in same contract revenues for contracts in operation as of september  and from a decrease in the average number of hospital contracts in operation between the periods from contracts during to contracts during the reduction in same contract revenues resulted from hospital contract rate renegotiations and restructurings  which are expected to continue in the company anticipates that continued new hospital contract signings and reduced hospital contract terminations will increase the average number of contracts in operation during compared with the company also anticipates that dtca revenues for will increase over revenues primarily as a result of additional lives enrolled under its existing diabetes population management contracts with managed care payors as well as from additional lives from new managed care payor contracts anticipated to be signed during the increase in salaries and benefits for over resulted primarily from higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of lives enrolled in dtca s managed care payor contracts  from increased employee incentive compensation awards associated with improved operating performance during and from severance and other employee related costs of approximately  associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare managed care payor contracts 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at its managed care contract operations and as a result of the settlement associated with the coventry healthcare contract terminations 
the company anticipates salaries and benefits expense to increase during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased staff required for expected increases in the number of lives enrolled under dtca s managed care contracts 
the increase in other operating expenses for over resulted primarily from higher costs associated with increases in the average number of lives enrolled in dtca s managed care payor contracts and from other operating expenses of approximately  associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare managed care payor contracts 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for primarily as a result of improved revenue performance at dtca s managed care payor contracts 
the company anticipates other operating expenses will increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased costs associated with anticipated increases in the number of lives enrolled under dtca s managed care payor contracts as well as from increased expenses associated with planned improvements in the company s information technology capabilities including the costs associated with its year compliance efforts 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for from resulted from decreased amortization expense associated with its hospital treatment center operations as a result of expensing contract start up costs as incurred during in comparison to amortizing these costs over periods of one to three years during prior years 
this decrease was offset somewhat by the increased depreciation expense associated with furniture  equipment and computer related capital expenditures associated with its diabetes population management operations for managed care payors 
the company anticipates depreciation and amortization expense to increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased information technology and other capital expenditures associated with expected increases in the number of covered lives enrolled under dtca s managed care payor contracts as well as from improvement in the company s information technology capabilities 
as a result of the company s distribution of its amsurg common stock and pursuant to the terms of the company s stock option plans  the number of shares issuable pursuant to the company s outstanding stock options and the exercise price per share were adjusted to maintain the value of the options subsequent to the distribution at the pre distribution level 
this adjustment had the effect of reducing the average exercise price of outstanding options to per share from per share and resulted in an additional  shares being subject to options 
additionally  all outstanding options became fully vested 
as a result of this adjustment of the stock options  generally accepted accounting principles required that the company record non cash compensation expense and an equal increase in stockholders equity additional paid in capital in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate exercise price of outstanding options to purchase shares of the company s common stock having an exercise price below the market price of the company s common stock and the aggregate market price for such shares immediately prior to the distribution 
the compensation expense and associated increase in additional paid in capital were recognized because generally accepted accounting principles require such recognition when an adjustment results in a change in the ratio of the exercise price to the market price per share even though no change in the aggregate value of the options has taken place 
the impact of this adjustment on the company s financial statements is summarized below net income increase decrease compensation expense  estimated deferred income tax benefit  net decrease in net income  stockholders equity increase decrease increase in paid in capital  net decrease in net income  net increase in stockholders equity  the company s income tax benefit increased to million for compared to  for primarily as a result of the income tax benefit generated in from the non recurring stock option expense adjustment associated with the amsurg distribution offset partially by improved operating performance in the company s operating results before consideration of this stock option expense adjustment 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax benefit rates during both and are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and the amortization of excess costs over net assets of purchased companies which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
the results of operations from discontinued operations for and for include the company s share of amsurg s net income or loss based on the company s percentage ownership of amsurg as well as the company s expenses associated with the distribution which totaled  during and  during fiscal compared to fiscal the dtca revenues decrease for from resulted primarily from the impact of dtca hospital contract rate renegotiations and restructurings and hospital contract terminations  offset somewhat by revenues from new dtca hospital contracts and by revenues generated during under the managed care payor contracts for diabetes population management services 
hospital contract rate renegotiations and restructurings were the primary reasons for a decrease in same contract revenues for contracts in operation as of september  the increase in overall dtca salaries and benefits for over resulted primarily from higher staffing costs associated with dtca s managed care contracts for diabetes population management services and from normal salary and benefit increases 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues for were as compared with for this increase resulted primarily from the impact of additional salary costs associated with the company s managed care contract operations which produced limited revenues during the increase in dtca s other operating expenses for over resulted primarily from increased costs associated with the implementation of managed care contracts for diabetes population management services causing other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for to increase to compared with for the increase in dtca s depreciation and amortization expense for from resulted from additional amortization expense associated with the costs of hospital contract development at contracts recently placed in operation plus the depreciation expense associated with furniture  equipment and computer related capital expenditures at the managed care payor sites partially offset by reduced amortization at dtca hospital contracts where the costs of contract development have been fully amortized 
the decrease in income tax expense resulting in an income tax benefit for compared with income tax expense for for from resulted from a non recurring favorable  adjustment to income tax expense in from the favorable resolution of prior year income tax issues with the irs as well as from decreased operating results for the differences between the federal statutory income tax rate of and the company s effective income tax rates during the periods are due primarily to the favorable nonrecurring adjustment in  the impact of state income taxes and the amortization of certain excess costs over net assets of purchased companies which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal generated million in cash flow which included a cash flow benefit of approximately million associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts 
investing activities during this period used million which consisted of million used for the acquisition of property and equipment purchases for dtca primarily associated with its expanding managed care payor operations  and  in amsurg distribution costs paid during the year 
financing activities associated with continuing operations for fiscal used  in cash flow which included  used to repurchase the company s stock offset partially by  in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase the company s common stock 
the company believes that cash flow from dtca operating activities and the company s available cash balances of million at august  will continue to enable the company to fund dtca s current working capital needs  including the working capital and capital expenditures associated with its managed care payor operations  the payment of the remaining costs associated with the termination of the coventry healthcare contracts  and the costs associated with the company s year compliance efforts 
in addition  the company may also utilize its cash resources to fund repurchases of the company s common stock  as of august  the company had repurchased  shares of stock pursuant to an authorization to purchase up to  shares as approved by the company s board of directors in january
