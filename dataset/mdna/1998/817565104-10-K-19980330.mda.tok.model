dollars in thousands  except average sales prices and per share data a primary objective of the company is to maximize shareholder value 
to accomplish this goal  one of the company s strategies has been to provide consistent growth in earnings per share

the majority of the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are established in and around metropolitan areas to take advantage of operational efficiencies  particularly the sharing of operating expenses such as service personnel  vehicles  preparation services  clerical staff and certain building facility costs 
personnel costs  the largest operating expense for the company  is the cost component most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allow the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities during fluctuations in the number of funeral services and cemetery interments performed in a given period 
the company s acquisitions are primarily located within existing cluster areas or create new cluster area opportunities 
the company has approximately clusters  which range in size from two operations to operations 
there may be more than one cluster in a given metropolitan area  depending upon the level and degree of shared costs

financial condition and liquidity at december  general historically  the company has funded its working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank revolving credit agreements and commercial paper 
funding required for the company s acquisition program has been generated through public and private offerings of debt and the issuance of equity securities supplemented by the company s revolving credit agreements and additional securities registered with the commission 
the company believes cash from operations  additional funds available under its revolving credit agreements  proceeds from public and private offerings of securities will be sufficient to continue its current acquisition program and operating policies 
at december   the company had net working capital of  and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of  and a current ratio of at december  revolving credit agreements the company has various revolving credit facilities and lines of credit which currently provide for aggregate borrowings of approximately  at december   approximately  was available under these facilities 
these facilities have financial compliance provisions that contain certain restrictions on levels of net worth  debt  liens and guarantees 
sources and uses of cash cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  this increase was primarily due to improved operating results in significant uses of operating cash include an increase in net receivables resulting from increased sales of funeral services and cemetery products and merchandise 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in cash used in acquisitions and  of increased capital expenditures including new construction of facilities and major improvements to existing properties 
cash used for capital expenditures was  during the year ended december  additionally  the company used approximately  to increase its investment in existing equity investees  while approximately  in cash was provided by the sale of the company s interest in eci 
cash used relating to prearranged funeral activities decreased due to the timing of cash payments to and withdrawals from trusts  offset by increased cash outlays on prearranged marketing efforts 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  as of december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was compared to at december  the interest rate coverage ratio for the year ended december  was excluding the gain on the sale of the company s investment in eci  compared to for the same period in this interest rate coverage level has been relatively consistent  despite higher levels of debt outstanding  for several years 
the company believes that the acquisition of funeral and cemetery operations funded with debt or company common stock is a prudent business strategy given the stable cash flow generated and the low failure rate exhibited by these types of businesses 
the company believes these acquired firms are capable of servicing the additional debt and providing a sufficient return on the company s investment 
the company expects adequate sources of funds to be available to finance its future operations and acquisitions through internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of securities 
at december   the company had approximately  of available borrowings under various revolving credit facilities and lines of credit 
at december   the company had the ability to issue  in securities registered with the commission under a shelf registration in march  the company issued  of long term notes under the shelf to repay borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
in addition   shares of common stock and a total of  of guaranteed promissory notes and convertible debentures are registered with the commission under a separate shelf registration to be used exclusively for future acquisitions 
prearranged funeral services the company has a marketing program to sell prearranged funeral contracts and the funds collected are generally held in trust or are used to purchase a life insurance or annuity contract 
the principal amount of these prearranged funeral contracts will be received in cash by a company funeral service location at the time the funeral is performed 
earnings on trust funds and increasing benefits under insurance funded contracts also increase the amount of cash to be received upon performance of the funeral and are intended to cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service as well as any selling costs 
during  the company completed a review of the prearranged trust investment process which included an asset liability study 
this has resulted in a new investment program which entails the consolidation of multiple trustees  the use of institutional managers with differing investment styles and consolidated performance monitoring and tracking 
this new program targets a real return in excess of the amount necessary to cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service as well as any selling costs 
this is accomplished by allocating the portfolio mix to the appropriate investments that more accurately match the anticipated maturity of the policies 
the company is currently reallocating the portfolio to achieve a new asset allocation of approximately equity and fixed income 
marketing costs incurred with the sale of prearranged funeral contracts are a current use of cash which is partially offset with cash retained  pursuant to state laws  from amounts trusted and certain commissions earned by the company for sales of insurance products issued by third party insurers 
the company sells prearranged funerals in most of its service markets including its foreign markets 
auxia  the company s french life insurance subsidiary  primarily sells insurance products used to fund prearranged funerals to be performed by the company s french funeral service locations 
prearranged funeral service sales afford the company the opportunity to both protect current market share and mix as well as expand market share in certain markets 
the company believes this will stimulate future revenue growth 
prearranged funeral services fulfilled as a percent of the total north american funerals performed annually approximates and is expected to grow  thereby making the total number of funerals performed more predictable 
cremations in recent years there has been steady  gradual growth in the number of cremations that have been chosen as an alternative to traditional methods of disposal of human remains 
in  nearly of all families served by the company s north american funeral service locations selected the cremation alternative  substantially more than the national average according to industry studies 
the company has a significant number of operating locations in florida and the west coast of north america where the cremation alternative continues to gain acceptance 
based on industry studies  the company believes that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in australia and the united kingdom 
it is estimated that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in france 
though a cremation typically results in fewer sales dollars than a traditional funeral service  the company believes that funeral operations which are predominantly cremation businesses typically have higher gross profit margin percentages than those exhibited at traditional funeral operations 
cremation memorialization has long been a tradition in the australian and united kingdom markets 
the company has expanded its product alternatives in these markets which has resulted in higher average sales 
the company has also established markets in select areas within north america and believes that memorialization of cremated remains represents a source of revenue growth

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to substantially hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
accordingly  movements in currency rates that impact the swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying assets being hedged and movements in interest rates that impact the fair value of the interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying debt being hedged 
similarly  currency movements that impact foreign interest expense due under the cross currency interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the earnings of the foreign operation 
fair values included herein have been determined based on market prices provided by counterparties 
the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes four  eight and nine to the consolidated financial statements 
in general  interest rates are managed such that to of the total debt excluding debt which offsets the provident loan receivable portfolio is floating rate and thus is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
after giving effect to the interest rate swaps  the company s total debt has been converted into approximately  of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately  of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
at december   a one percent increase in the various floating rate indices referenced in the debt and swaps excluding amounts borrowed to issue loans by provident would cause a  net increase in interest expense 
however  the company s overall sensitivity to floating interest rates is diversified in that approximately of the company s floating rate exposure is based in four markets other than the united states 
in general  the company hedges up to of its net investment in foreign assets when such investment is considered significant and when it is reasonably cost efficient to do so 
the death care industries in countries where the company has foreign operations are generally stable and have had predictable cash flows 
in addition  those countries have not had highly inflationary economies 
approximately one third of the company s net assets and one quarter of its operating income are denominated in foreign currencies 
due to the cross currency hedges described above  approximately of the company s net assets and approximately of the company s operating earnings are subject to translation risk

for certain assets and debt  the table below presents principal cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
for swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and expected interest rates that the company will receive and pay that exist by contractual dates
