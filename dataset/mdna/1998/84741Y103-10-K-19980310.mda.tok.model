overview the company manufactures superalloys and special alloys  which are highly engineered metal alloys designed to withstand extreme heat  stress and corrosion 
special metals operates three divisions 
the superalloy billet and bar division manufactures a wide array of wrought superalloy and special alloy products in billet  bar and cast form  which are used primarily in jet engines 
this division also produces shape memory alloys  such as nitinol  which are primarily used in medical and dental applications 
the powder division produces powder metallurgy superalloy products for military jet engines and the latest generation of large commercial jet engines and is the world s largest independent manufacturer of superalloy powder products 
the dental division is the leading north american producer of amalgamable dental alloys 
in  the superalloy billet and bar division  the powder division and the dental division accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales of million 
net sales 
net sales include sales of the company s superalloy and special alloy products and revenue earned from toll conversion 
sales of the company s products are made under conventional purchase orders  one year supply contracts  long term firm price contracts and indexed price contracts 
long term firm price and indexed price contracts have become more prevalent in the superalloy industry because jet engine manufacturers are required to provide firm price quotations to airlines for jet engines to be delivered several years in the future 
approximately of the pounds shipped of the company s wrought products in were sold under long term firm price contracts negotiated in because of the adverse business conditions prevailing when the long term firm price contracts were negotiated in  the pricing on these contracts was unfavorable for superalloy producers and resulted in severely depressed margins in the superalloy industry from to special metals recognized losses on these long term firm price contracts in and generally did not earn a profit on such contracts in or all of the firm price contracts negotiated in expired prior to december  in recent years  to the extent that it has entered into long term agreements  the company has sought pricing terms that are either indexed or otherwise accommodate changes in product and raw material markets 
export sales represent a significant portion of the company s business 
in  and  sales to purchasers outside of the united states totaled  and of the company s net sales  respectively 
all of the company s export sales are conducted in us dollars 
costs of goods sold 
the superalloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs  and profitability is therefore significantly affected by changes in volume 
variable costs such as raw materials  labor  supplies and energy primarily electricity generally account for over three fourths of the company s costs of goods sold 
fixed costs  such as indirect overhead and depreciation  constitute the remainder of the company s costs of goods sold 
the company has undertaken numerous projects to maintain and improve its efficiency and cost position over the last few years 
a substantial portion of the company s raw material used in production consists of commodities  such as nickel  which are subject to wide price fluctuations 
the price the company pays for nickel is usually based upon quoted prices on the london metals exchange the lme plus a premium due to quality  location  and volume purchased 
although the company s long term agreements provide for certain price adjustments to reflect changes in the price of raw materials  once a customer places an order  the price is fixed and is not subject to further adjustment 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks associated with raw material price fluctuations and to match raw material purchases with firm price product orders  the company often enters into forward contracts to manage its exposure to changes in nickel prices and also enters into contracts for the purchase of scrap with customers 
nickel forward contracts obligate the company to make or receive payment equal to the net change in value of the contract at its maturity 
substantially all contracts are designated as hedges of the company s firm sales commitments  are timed to correspond to the commitment period  and are effective in hedging the company s exposure to changes in nickel prices during that cycle 
at december   the company had open purchase contracts with a notional principal value of approximately million 
the fair value of the material covered by these contracts  based on the december  price quoted on the lme  was approximately million 
unrealized gains and losses on the contracts which have been designated  and are effective  as hedges for firm sales commitments  totaling approximately million  have been deferred 
unrealized losses on forward contracts not designated or effective as hedges  totaling approximately 
million  have been recognized in income currently

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments and working capital 
the company has historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations and from short term and long term debt financing including borrowings from the principal stockholders 
the company s business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in the manufacturing process and compliance with environmental laws 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
improvements in cash flows from operating activities are principally the result of improved operating results  offset by increased working capital requirements principally attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from increased sales during the period 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the company s principal sources of funds are i funds generated from operations and ii borrowings under the company s credit agreement with credit lyonnais and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  as amended  the company may borrow  repay  and re borrow from time to time  the lesser of a million  declining million per year from through  at which time all remaining outstanding amounts are due  or b the company s borrowing base

as of december   the borrowing base was million 
the company s ability to borrow under the credit agreement is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions  including compliance with certain financial covenants 
the amount the company may borrow under the credit agreement is reduced by the aggregate amount of any letters of credit issued for the account of the company 
all advances under the credit agreement bear interest at the company s option at i a base rate  which is the higher of the bank s short term commercial reference rate or the federal funds rate plus  ii the eurodollar rate  which is the new york interbank offered rate  plus or iii libor plus

over the next four years  the company plans to invest up to million in capital expenditures to expand and modernize its melting  forging and finishing equipment  install a state of the art information system and make other investments to maintain its position as a technical leader 
currently planned capital expenditures for include the completion of two var furnaces  an esr furnace  construction and equipping of a new  square foot building at its new hartford facility  upgrades to the management information systems and a potential upgrade in forging capabilities 
in addition to planned capital expenditures  the company expects to evaluate from time to time potential acquisitions 
potential acquisitions may include investments in companies  technologies or products that complement the company s business or products 
sources of funds for such acquisitions could include funds generated from operations or alternative sources of debt or equity capital 
certain covenants in the credit agreement may restrict or limit the company s ability to enter into or complete an acquisition 
under such circumstances  the company would need to amend  obtain a waiver of or refinance the credit agreement 
the company does not expect the future recurring operation costs of compliance with currently enacted environmental laws and adopted or proposed regulations to have a material impact on its liquidity and capital resources 
however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental laws and the possibility of increased enforcement could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters 
the company expects that its cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under the credit agreement will be adequate to meet its anticipated operating requirements and planned capital expenditures over the next months 
backlog as of december   the company s backlog orders aggregated approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  the increase in backlog orders is primarily due to market demand and customer order patterns 
the company defines backlog as firm purchase orders  which are generally subject to cancellation by the customer 
substantially all orders in the backlog at december  are expected to be shipped within the months beginning january  due to the cyclical nature of order entry experienced by the company and its dependence on the aerospace industry  there can be no assurance that order entry will continue at current levels or that current firm purchase orders will not be canceled or delayed 
inflation although the company s sales and results of operations are affected by the prices of raw materials used to make its products and the cyclicality of the aerospace industry  the company does not believe that general economic inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation for the periods presented 
legal proceedings reference is made to the information included in item legal proceedings beginning on page of this form k  which is hereby incorporated by reference 
impact of year based on a preliminary assessment  the company believes it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has undertaken a project aimed at replacing its current management information systems with new management information systems which it believes will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
however  the company also believes that modifications to certain of its process control computers will be required so that they will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  a material impact on the operations of the company could result 
the company is in the process of initiating formal communications with its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s estimate of the time to complete its year project includes the estimated time associated with the impact of third party year issues  and is based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has determined it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company expects to utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project in  prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company is not able  at this time  to estimate what the ultimate cost of its year project will be 
the time frame during which the company believes it will complete the year modifications is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that the estimated time of completion will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
