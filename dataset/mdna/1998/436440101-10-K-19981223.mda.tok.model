item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
overview since inception  the company has experienced generally increasing annual sales as interest in bone diseases  such as osteoporosis  has grown  as new drug therapies have become available in the united states and other countries to treat these diseases and as the use of dxa systems to measure bone density has become more widespread 
in fiscal  sales of the company s x ray bone densitometers reached record levels  especially in the united states as the clinical use of bone densitometers continued to expand 
the company introduced the first dual energy x ray absorptiometry dxa bone densitometer in and continued with a string of new product advancements including the introduction of the fourth generation clinically oriented acclaim series of bone densitometers in fiscal in july  the company began international shipments of sahara  a completely dry ultrasound bone sonometer system that does not require water as a coupling medium like the other competitive devices 
in march  sahara was approved for sale in the united states by the food and drug administration 
the company believes that future growth will be in part conditional upon the success of sales of sahara  especially in the united states to the primary care market 
in fiscal  the company acquired fluoroscan imaging systems  inc  an industry leader in the field of mini c arm imaging systems 
sales of mini c arms has accounted for less than of the company s total revenues since the acquisition 
the availability of reimbursement to healthcare providers for bone density measurements of patients continues as an important factor in the attractiveness of the company s bone densitometers 
effective january   the health care finance administration  the agency which administers medicare  increased the recommended reimbursement rates for central dxa tests to a national average of  from  and in october  the american medical association established a permanent certified procedural terminology cpt code for ultrasound bone density measurement 
the newly created cpt code will become effective january  with a recommended national average reimbursement rate of in addition  the recommended reimbursement rate for central dxa tests will remain at approximately on average 
in connection with a fee per scan program offered for the company s dxa bone densitometers  the company has entered into a remarketing agreement whereby the company has agreed to perform certain remarketing activities on a best efforts basis and to cover any losses incurred by the leasing company up to of the total fee per scan contracts funded 
the leasing company purchases all such dxa densitometers covered under these contracts from the company 
the company has reserved for potential losses under these contracts by deferring revenue of an amount equal to of the contracts funded 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by items as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales other revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation expenses 
acquisition expenses income from operations interest income other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was due to an increase in the total number of sahara the company s ultrasound bone sonometer product sales  especially in the united states  and an increase in the total number of dxa product sales which were partially offset by decreased sales of mini c arm imaging systems 
the increase in the number of dxa bone densitometers sold was primarily attributable to a significant increase in sales to the primary care market in the united states partially offset by a decrease in sales to the domestic hospital and radiology markets and a decrease in the number of dxa s sold internationally  especially in asia 
additionally  in the united states  the increase in the number of dxa bone densitometers sold was partially offset by lower average selling prices primarily attributed to this shift in sales to the primary care market 
the primary care market accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased from million in the immediately preceding quarter and remained relatively unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the sequential quarter decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the focus of the company s us distributor for the primary care market to the sahara bone sonometer from the dxa line of bone densitometers 
in the current quarter  compared to the immediately preceding quarter  sales of dxa bone densitometers into the primary care market decreased significantly and were only partially offset by increased sahara sales 
the company believes that sales of the sahara were adversely impacted by a lack of a permanent reimbursement code for ultrasound bone density measurement 
the company further believes that the approval by hcfa of a permanent reimbursement code for these measurements  scheduled to take effect in january  should positively impact sahara sales 
however  the company cannot assure that sahara sales will increase 
the company s sales may also be somewhat seasonal  with generally lower sales in its fourth quarter  reflecting summer vacation schedules 
other revenues consist primarily of revenue relating to medical data management services provided to pharmaceutical companies to assist in the collection and monitoring of clinical trial data  royalty revenues from the company s licensing of its technology to a related party and additional revenues generated from the company s strategic alliance program on a fee per scan basis 
in fiscal  other revenues increased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to additional fee per scan revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in other international markets and in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia and in other international markets 
the company expects that foreign sales in the current fiscal year will continue to account for a substantial portion of product sales 
continued economic and currency related uncertainty in a number of foreign countries  especially in asia and latin america  could reduce the company s future sales to these markets 
costs and expenses 
the cost of product sales increased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to i a dramatic shift in the product sales mix to the primary care market in the united states  ii lower sales to its hospital and radiology markets which tended to purchase the higher gross margin acclaim systems and iii lower sales prices for mini c arm systems 
in the first half of the fiscal year  the company predominantly sold the lower gross margin qdr plus in the primary care market 
in the second half of the fiscal year  sales shifted in this market to the company s qdr c but at an average selling price less than in the prior year 
partially offsetting these factors were increased sales of the higher gross margin sahara ultrasound sonometers  especially in the united states 
research and development expenses increased to million of total revenues in fiscal from million of total revenues in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel and outside consultants working on the development of new products and product enhancements 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million of product sales in fiscal from million of product sales in fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses in is primarily due to an increase in sales commissions based on the higher sales volume in the primary care market in the united states 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of total revenues in fiscal from million of total revenues in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable reserve related to the company s foreign accounts receivable  especially in brazil  and an increase in employee benefit related expenses 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  the company held a higher investment base than in the prior year 
the company has invested these proceeds in investment grade corporate and government securities 
other expense 
in fiscal and the company incurred other expenses of approximately  and  respectively 
these expenses were primarily attributable to the interest costs on a bank line of credit used by the company s european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for all intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure on those transactions 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  the company may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although the company has established a borrowing line denominated in the two foreign currencies the french franc and the belgian franc in which the subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful or can fully hedge its outstanding exposure 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the company s effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rates due primarily to the favorable federal and state tax treatment afforded the company s foreign sales corporation and the favorable state tax treatment of certain of the company s interest income 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the total number of dxa product shipments in the united states  europe and latin america 
the increase in dxa product revenues in these markets were partially offset by fewer sales in asia and  to a lesser extent  by decreased sales of mini c arm imaging systems 
there has also been a shift in product sales mix to the company s new line of bone densitometers  the acclaim series  which the company began shipping in january the new acclaim products have higher average selling prices than the comparable dxa bone densitometers which they replace 
in fiscal  other revenues increased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to additional fee per scan revenues and from an increase in royalty revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in asia  in europe and in other international markets 
costs and expenses 
the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to i increased shipments of the latest family of dxa bone densitometers  the acclaim series  which earns a better gross margin than the company s older dxa systems  ii a volume increase in the number of dxa systems sold resulting in certain manufacturing efficiencies and iii an increase in sales by the company s direct sales force primarily in the united states which resulted in higher average selling prices 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased costs and lower sales relating to mini c arm systems 
research and development expenses increased to million of total revenues in fiscal from million of total revenues in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel working on the development of new products  product enhancements and the funding of serex to develop a biochemical marker strip test 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million of product sales in fiscal from million of product sales in fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales personnel and related expenses  marketing and promotional costs incurred in connection with the acclaim series and increased sales commissions based on the higher sales volume 
in addition  the company incurred additional costs in connection with its strategic alliances for the introduction and planned introduction of new products and the distribution of products through new sales channels 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million of total revenues in fiscal from million of total revenues in fiscal the decrease in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to certain efficiencies achieved in connection with the integration of fluoroscan 
litigation expenses incurred in fiscal were in connection with the company s disputes with lunar corporation lunar and bv optische industrie de oude delf oldelft 
legal expenses in connection with the patent litigation with lunar began in october and represent a substantial portion of the total litigation expenses 
in november  a definitive agreement that provides for the cross licensing of certain patent rights and a non assertion agreement for all patents involving dxa and ultrasound technologies for a period of ten years was reached by the company and lunar 
the complaint brought by oldelft against the company was settled in may acquisition expenses incurred in fiscal were direct transaction costs related to the company s merger with fluoroscan imaging systems  inc these costs were expensed in the period incurred in accordance with the pooling of interests accounting for business combinations 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  the company earned a slightly higher rate of return on a higher investment base than in the prior year 
in january  the company received proceeds of approximately million from a public sale of common stock which increased the investment base 
the company also received approximately million from the exercise of fluoroscan warrants in july the company has invested these proceeds in investment grade corporate and government securities 
in fiscal  the company also increased the number of long term receivables to latin american customers resulting in additional interest income 
other expense 
in fiscal and the company incurred other expenses of approximately  and  respectively 
these expenses were primarily attributable to the interest costs on a bank line of credit used by the company s european subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rates due primarily to the tax benefits associated with the company s foreign sales corporation and the utilization of net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and tax credits 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the significant increase in us income 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital was million and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily due to the purchase of a  square foot building for approximately million and an increase in inventories  which were partially offset by other operating activities which included net income of million and an increase in deferred revenue 
the increase in inventory is primarily related to increased production of sahara 
the company finances certain sales to latin america over a two to three year time frame 
at september   the company had long term accounts receivable outstanding of approximately million relating to these sales  which were included in other assets 
as of september   the company had not experienced any significant change in these receivables  however  the economic and currency related uncertainties in these countries may increase the likelihood of non payment 
as a result  the company increased its bad debt reserve in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  the company purchased approximately million of property and equipment in addition to the building  primarily computers and other equipment associated with the hiring of additional personnel 
as noted above  the company purchased a  square foot building in fiscal for approximately million in cash and the company plans to spend approximately million in renovations prior to occupying the facility early in the company does not have any other significant capital commitments and believes that existing sources of liquidity and funds expected to be generated from operations will provide adequate cash to fund the company s anticipated working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
year readiness disclosure the year yk issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to could generate system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar ordinary business activities 
the company has defined yk compliance as the ability for the company  its products and suppliers to continue normal business activities in the year and beyond 
the company is evaluating the yk issue with respect to its financial and management information systems  its products and its suppliers 
at this point in its assessment  the company is not currently aware of any yk problems that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition  without taking into account the company s efforts to avoid such problems 
the company is completing its review of its management and information systems for yk compliance and has identified other application software and hardware which must be upgraded to become yk compliant 
the company believes that its accounting and information systems are currently compliant as a result of installing an upgrade version of the software made available through the annual maintenance contract 
however  the company uses other application hardware and software which may not be yk complaint 
most upgrades for these programs are also available as part of an annual maintenance program 
the company believes that it already has and installed most of the necessary upgrades for these programs or that the upgrades for the programs are otherwise available without material expenditure by the company 
the company anticipates that it will be able to complete  test and implement all upgrades of this software that may be material to its business on a timely basis 
there is a risk that  notwithstanding its internal review  if the company has not properly identified all year compliance issues with respect to its management and information systems  the company may not be able to implement all necessary changes to these systems on a timely basis and within budget 
such a failure could result in a material disruption to the company s business  including the inability to track and fill orders on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has evaluated its dxa products currently in production and believes that they will be yk compliant by the end of january  as the compliant version of software is in beta test 
the company plans to make this software available  at the company s expense  to its customers by the end of march these costs are not expected to be material 
the company has also identified certain older models of its dxa products that will need computer hardware upgrades to become yk compliant 
the company plans to offer users of these products a computer upgrade at the customers expense 
the company believes that its sahara ultrasound bone sonometer is currently yk compliant 
the company is also exposed to the risk that it could experience material shipment delays from its major component suppliers or material sales delays from its major customers due to year issues relating either to their management information or production systems 
the company has inquired of these suppliers in an attempt to ascertain their year readiness 
at this time  the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  such as its suppliers and customers  to achieve year compliance 
moreover  such third parties  even if year compliant  could experience difficulties resulting from year issues that may affect their suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from their major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major customers due to year issues  these third parties could experience year problems that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
apart from its activities described above  the company does not have and does not plan to develop a contingency plan to address yk issues 
should any unanticipated significant yk issues arise  the company s failure to implement such a contingency plan could have a material adverse affect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that the company does not identify any material non compliant year issues affecting the company or third parties  such as the company s suppliers  service providers and customers  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a systemic failure beyond the control of the company  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure  or a general disruption in united states or global business activities that could result in a significant economic downturn 
the company believes that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure or other disruption  would include but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  increased operating costs  inability to obtain inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments  or other business interruptions of a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
dependence of product sales on availability and acceptance of new drug therapies 
the company believes that it is important for the continued growth of its sales of bone densitometers and other related products  that the efficacy of new drug therapies to treat osteoporosis and other bone disorders be demonstrated  that broadened regulatory approval of those therapies be granted in the united states and elsewhere  and once approved  that these new drug therapies gain acceptance 
similarly  the company believes that it is important for the growth of sales of its mini c arm products that the efficacy of therapies that could broaden the use of minimally invasive orthopedic surgery such as synthetic bone materials be demonstrated  that broadened regulatory approval of those therapies be granted in the united states and elsewhere  and once approved  that these new therapies gain acceptance 
the company cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective  obtain fda approval  or that any fda approved therapy will gain wide acceptance 
the failure of one or more of these therapies to gain wide acceptance  or the failure of new therapies to be approved and gain acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
uncertainty of health care reform 
health care reform and medical cost containment have received significant attention in the united states and many foreign countries 
certain reform proposals and cost containment measures could limit the use of the company s products  reduce reimbursement available for such use  or adversely affect the use of new therapies for which the company s products may be targeted 
as a result  such reforms or cost containment measures could materially and adversely affect the company s sales 
uncertainty in the medical community regarding the nature and effect of proposed health care reforms and cost containment measures may also have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
third party reimbursement for bone density examinations 
reimbursement for the use of bone densitometers has been approved by health care insurance systems in the united states and many foreign countries 
in the united states  bone density examinations are paid for by many private third party insurers 
in addition  the health care finance administration which establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of health care providers treating medicare and medicaid patients  has approved reimbursement for dxa examinations and  commencing in january  for ultrasound examinations 
the actual reimbursement amounts provided for these examinations is determined by the individual state medicare carriers 
there are often delays between the approval of reimbursement by hcfa and by a state medicare carrier 
moreover  states may choose not to follow the hcfa reimbursement guidelines 
the company believes that it is important for the continued growth of sales of its sahara bone sonometer in the united states and internationally that reimbursement for bone density examinations be more broadly adopted 
a reduction in reimbursement levels for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
developing markets  need to broaden market acceptance 
the continued success of the company s products that address the clinical market for the early diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis  will depend upon the acceptance and adoption of newly introduced and emerging drug therapies to treat osteoporosis by the broad market of primary care providers  such as gynecologists and family physicians  and the company s ability to broaden sales of its products to these physician groups 
in the united states  pss serves as the company s exclusive sales representative to this market 
historically  the company has marketed its mini c arm products to hospitals and surgery centers for use by orthopedic surgeons in the operating room 
the success of these products will be dependent upon its ability to broaden its sales to orthopedic and podiatric physician groups 
the company cannot give assurance that it will be successful in obtaining broader market acceptance for its products 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product development  uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
the company has a continuing program of research and development designed to enhance and improve its products 
in addition  the company is developing  together with serex  inc  a diagnostic strip test to detect biochemical markers that indicate the rate of a patient s bone loss 
the development of these products will be subject to all of the risks associated with new product development  including unanticipated delays  expenses  technical problems or other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the commercialization of these new products 
the company cannot give assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market these products and product enhancements once developed 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
obsolescence and rapid technological change 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
several companies have developed or are developing bone densitometry systems or other products that measure or assess bone density or bone mineral status  which compete  or will compete  with the company s products 
these other systems include single photon absorptiometry  radiographic absorptiometry  quantitative computed tomography  ultrasound and biochemical markers 
in addition  many companies  research institutions and universities may be working in a number of engineering and radiology disciplines similar to those being used and developed by the company with respect to is mini c arm products 
as a result  the company s mini c arm products may become subject to competition from products using technologies other than those developed by the company  which may render the company s mini c arm products obsolete or less attractive to customers if the company cannot participate in such new technologies 
the company cannot give assurance that continuing improvements in current or new technologies will not make them technically equivalent or superior to the company s technologies  in addition to providing cost or other advantages 
competition 
the company competes directly with a number of companies with significant financial resources  including lunar  norland medical systems  aloha and hitachi  each of which has developed dxa systems to measure bone density 
in ultrasound  the company competes with lunar and myriad and expects additional competitors based upon the greater availability of ultrasound technology 
in addition  lunar  norland and schick have peripheral dxa systems which may compete with the company s dxa and ultrasound products  primarily on price 
the company s fluoroscan subsidiary competes directly with a limited number of companies including lunar  oec medical and xitec 
the company also competes indirectly with manufacturers of conventional c arm image intensifiers including philips  siemens  general electric  oec medical  fischer imaging and picker international 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
the company cannot give assurance that it will be able to compete successfully 
customer concentration  sales channel risks 
in the united states  the company sells its products to the primary care market through pss 
in fiscal and sales in which pss acted either as a sales representative or distributor for the company accounted for and of the company s product revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  the majority of these sales to the primary care market were made pursuant to the company s strategic alliance program with sanwa 
in and the company s sales under this program accounted for and of the company s product revenues  respectively 
the pricing and other features of this program is periodically reviewed by the company and sanwa 
as a result of recent changes made to the strategic alliance program  the company believes that the program may be less attractive for pss and that sales to the primary care market under this program may therefore decrease 
in addition  the company cannot assure that the program will be continued for an extended period on favorable terms  if at all 
a material reduction in revenues under the strategic alliance program  a termination or other cutback of this program  a reduction of sales through pss or the loss of pss as the company s sales representative could have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
risks relating to remarketing obligations 
under its strategic alliance program with sanwa  the company is obligated to use best efforts to remarket equipment repossessed by or returned to sanwa 
the company has engaged pss to assist it in remarketing the equipment originally placed by pss 
the efforts of the company and pss to remarket this equipment could have a material adverse affect on future sales 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results 
the company s results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation 
the results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors including the overall state of health care and cost containment efforts  the development status and demand for drug therapies to treat osteoporosis  economic conditions in the company s markets  the timing of orders  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  the mix of products sold by the company  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  and pricing and other competitive conditions 
the company also believes that its sales may be somewhat seasonal  with reduced orders in the summer months reflecting summer vacation schedules 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
any of these factors also could materially adversely effect the company s annual results of operations 
no assurance that new products will receive fda or foreign regulatory clearances 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices  particularly those that employ x ray technology 
the company s products are also subject to approval and regulation by certain foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
moreover  any approvals or clearances  once obtained  can be withdrawn or modified 
the company s delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign clearances or approvals for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
reliance on serex for the development of biochemical marker strip test 
the company has entered into a research and development agreement with serex to develop biochemical marker strip tests to monitor bone resorption 
serex is a relatively small company with limited resources and limited operating history 
serex has experienced delays and budget overruns in the development of this strip test 
serex could continue to encounter delays and budget overruns in developing this strip test 
the company cannot give assurance that serex will be successful in developing the strip test  or that once developed  that the strip test will be commercially successful 
reliance on foreign sales  restriction on fluoroscan s foreign sales 
in years ended september   and september  foreign sales accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s product sales 
the company maintains sales and service offices in belgium  france and spain 
the expenses and sales of these offices are denominated in local currencies 
the company anticipates that foreign sales and foreign denominated sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s total sales  which will result in a significant portion of the company s revenues being subject to risks associated with foreign sales  including risks of exchange rate fluctuations  limitations on foreign sales of high technology products and other united states and foreign regulatory requirements and policy changes  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives and seasonality of sales 
the company s mini c arm technology is governed by the international traffic in arms regulations of the united states department of state 
as a result  the export of those products to certain countries may be limited or prohibited 
on january   of the member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of january   the transition to the euro will be complete 
the company has significant operations within the european union and is currently preparing for the euro conversion 
the issues that the company is addressing include preparing its information systems for the euro  analyzing the benefit of decreased exchange rate risk in cross border transactions involving participating countries and assessing the potential impact of increased price transparency 
in addition  the euro may impact general economic conditions such as interest and foreign exchange rates within the participating countries or in other areas where the company operates 
volatility in the euro exchange rates or other adverse impacts on the general economic conditions in europe or elsewhere resulting from the european union s conversion to the euro could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s functional currency for accounting purposes is the belgian franc in belgium and the french franc in france 
the company anticipates that its european subsidiaries will adopt the euro as their functional currency following the european union s conversion to the euro 
the company has hedged its foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local european currencies to pay the expenses of its foreign offices 
the company cannot assure that these hedging activities will be successful 
as a result  the impact of and economic conditions relating to the euro including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  particularly with respect to the us dollar could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of patent and proprietary rights protection 
the company relies upon trade secrets and patents to protect its technology 
as of september   the company had obtained patents  licensed patents and had pending patent applications in the united states 
these patents have expiration dates ranging from to one of the company s licensed us ultrasound patents will expire in  and two licensed patents with ultrasound and x ray claims will expire in the company does not believe that the expiration of these patents will have any material effect on its business 
the company has obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications for certain of these patents and patent applications for certain foreign countries 
the company cannot assure that any of the company s patent applications will be granted or that any patent or patent application will provide significant protection for the company s products and technology 
moreover  the company cannot assure that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  the company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the company s products  processes or technology 
the company had been involved in extensive patent litigation with lunar  with each party claiming that the other is infringing certain patents held by the other 
this litigation was settled by agreement dated november  the agreement provides for certain royalties to be paid by each party to the other for future sales of products using certain defined technologies 
the company does not believe that amounts to be paid by either party under this arrangement will be material 
the agreement also provides that neither party will engage the other party in patent litigation relating to these technologies for a period of ten years following the date of the agreement  regardless of the infringement claimed and regardless of whether the technology in question currently exists or is developed or acquired by the other party in the future 
as a result  lunar could use the company s technology during this ten year period in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the company s business 
the company has a license from nasa to use and develop certain technology that is used in its mini c arm products and that are the subject of two patents held by nasa 
fluoroscan s license is exclusive in the united states 
however  under fluoroscan s license agreement with nasa  nasa retains the right to use its technologies in connection with devices that it produces  including devices that may be produced and marketed by nasa in direct competition with the company 
nasa also has the right to circumvent the exclusivity of the license agreement if  in nasa s opinion  such circumvention is required to serve the public good and the national interest of the united states  and the company cannot serve such functions 
moreover  the company s license agreement with nasa is exclusive only in the united states and its territories 
accordingly  nasa retains the right to license its technologies to others outside of the united states  where such technologies are patented or can be patented 
the technology covered by the nasa patents is not patented in many foreign countries and may therefore not be protectable or may be cumbersome and expensive to enforce in such countries 
therefore  a competitor in one of these countries could reverse engineer fluoroscan s products and manufacture and sell products in direct competition with fluoroscan outside the united states 
the patents covered by this license expire in these patents previously had expiration dates in february and  but were extended as a result of the passage of the general agreement on tariff and trade gatt 
upon expiration of a patent  all of the technology covered by these patents will be accessible to potential competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on fluoroscan s business 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries 
the company has in the past  and may in the future be  notified that it may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against the company s intellectual property rights it may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement 
the company cannot assure  however  that a license will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the company could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims or to design around the patented technology 
such actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisition risks 
the company expects that in addition to internal development it will continue to seek to expand its products and technology in part through acquisitions or strategic alliances in complimentary markets  including other diagnostic or imaging markets  or other women s health care markets 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in identifying  acquiring and developing products and technology 
if any potential acquisition opportunities are identified  there can be no assurance that the company will consummate such acquisitions or successfully integrate the technology or businesses acquired into the company 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the incorporation of acquired products into existing product lines  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the loss of key employees of the acquired company or business and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by the company will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur it will not materially and adversely affect the company or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the company s business 
if the operations of the acquired company do not meet expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
attraction and retention of key personnel 
the future success of the company will depend in large part on the continued services of its executive officers  including the executive officers of fluoroscan  as well as the company s ability to attract and retain other highly qualified and well trained managerial and technical personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of its business
