cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
cost of oem revenues included in cost of goods sold primarily consisted of cost of royalties  except where the oem elected to purchase shrink wrapped products  in which case such costs were as described in the previous sentence 
all development costs incurred in connection with the development agreement are expensed as incurred as a separate component of cost of goods sold 
costs associated with non recurring engineering fees were included in research and development expenses and are not separately identifiable 
all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred 
consequently  there is no amortization of capitalized research and development costs included in cost of goods sold 
gross margin 
gross margin increased from in to in  and from in to in the increase in gross margin as a percent of gross revenues from to was primarily attributable to changes in product mix  representing changes in the mix of oem revenues versus product sold to distributors and resellers  and different products within the winframe product line  which were partially offset by the gross margin related to the development agreement revenues 
the increase in gross margin from to was also primarily attributable to changes in product mix  representing changes in the mix of oem revenues versus product sold to distributors and resellers  and different products within the winframe product line 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
increases in research and development expenses in and resulted primarily from additional staffing  associated salaries and related expenses required to expand and enhance the company s product lines and  in  third party expenses associated with the translation and localization of the winframe products as well as increased expenses associated with patent filings relating to certain aspects of the company s software products and technology 
additionally  in these costs were partially offset by the allocation of certain research and development expenses to cost of goods sold for the portion of these expenses associated with the development agreement revenues 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
the increases in sales  marketing and support expenses in and resulted primarily from increases in promotional and advertising activities  which include co op advertising programs and other promotional activities such as those directed at resellers  training programs  trade shows and other direct mail and advertising activities

this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with the purchase price being principally allocated to purchased technologies and intangible assets 
approximately million of the total purchase price represented the value of purchased research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and  as such  was recorded as a charge for purchased research and development 
the value attributed to the purchased research and development was determined by an independent appraisal 
additionally  in the first quarter of  the company has acquired certain technologies from insignia solutions and licensed certain technology from epicon  inc  for approximately million and million  respectively 
approximately million and million of the acquisition and the license  respectively  represent the value of purchased research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  and as such  will be recorded as a non recurring pre tax charge for purchased and research and development in the first quarter of the value attributed to the acquisition of certain technologies from insignia solutions was determined by an independent appraisal 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with these transactions or that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop these technologies 
interest income  net 
the increase in interest income  net  in was primarily due to interest income earned on additional cash generated from the receipt of an initial license fee under the terms of the development agreement and  to a lesser extent  interest income generated from the net proceeds of the company s public offering completed in june the increase in was primarily due to interest income generated from the net proceeds of the company s public offerings which were completed in june and december income taxes

such net operating loss carryforwards were included in the computation of the effective tax rate utilized in in  the company incurred income tax expense of  representing only alternative minimum taxes due to limitations in utilizing the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company generated positive operating cash flows primarily from the receipt of an initial license fee of million related to the development agreement 
the revenues from this development agreement are being recognized ratably over the contract period of five years  which caused a substantial increase in deferred revenue relating to the development agreement 
additionally  during the same period  the company increased profitability  which was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets attributable to the taxability of the initial license fee received under the terms of the development agreement 
the company also recognized tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of approximately million 
the company also purchased and sold short term investments for approximately million and million  respectively  during additionally  the company expended approximately million in the same period for the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment

certain factors which may affect future results the company does not provide financial performance forecasts 
the company s operating results and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance upon strategic relationship with microsoft 
microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems 
the company is dependent upon the license of certain key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses  technical support and other materials 
the company is also dependent on its strategic alliance agreement with microsoft which provides for cooperation in the development of technologies for advanced operating systems  and the promotion of advanced windows application program interfaces 
on may   the company and microsoft entered into a license  development and marketing agreement the development agreement which provides for the licensing to microsoft of certain of the company s multi user software enhancements to microsoft s windows nt server and for the cooperation between the parties for the development of certain future multi user versions of microsoft windows nt server  known as the windows based terminal server 
the development agreement also provides for each party to develop its own enhancements or plug ins to the jointly developed products which may provide access to the windows based terminal server platform from a wide variety of computing devices  such as a company developed plug in that implements the independent computing architecture ica r protocol on the new platform 
pursuant to the terms of the development agreement  the company received an aggregate of million as a non refundable royalty payment and for engineering and support services to be rendered by the company 
under the terms of the development agreement  the company will be eligible to receive royalty payments of up to an additional million based on microsoft s release and shipment of versions x and x of windows based terminal server products 
in addition  microsoft and the company have agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of windows nt server based multi user software and the company s ica protocol 
additionally  until at least november  microsoft has agreed to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred way to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows client devices 
further  subject to the terms of the development agreement  the company shall be entitled to license versions of its winframe technology based on windows nt v until at least september  the company s relationship with microsoft is subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
first  the windows based terminal server platforms will allow microsoft to create plug in products that will be competitive with at least some of the company s current winframe products and may in the future compete with the company s windows based terminal server plug in product offerings 
second  as stated above  microsoft has agreed to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred method to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows clients until at least november subsequent to november  it is possible that microsoft will market or endorse other methods to provide non windows client devices multi user windows access 
finally  the company s royalties pursuant to the development agreement rely significantly on microsoft s ability to market the windows based terminal server products 
microsoft s distributors and resellers are not within the control of the company and  to the company s knowledge  are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
additionally  the company may hire additional development  marketing and support staff to the extent they are needed in order to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
further  if microsoft develops competitive plug in products  endorses in the future other methods to provide non windows client devices multi user windows access or is unable to successfully market the windows based terminal server products  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
dependence upon broad based acceptance of ica protocol 
the company believes that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its ability to make its ica protocol an emerging standard for supporting distributed windows applications  thereby creating demand for its server products 
dependence upon strategic relationships 
in addition to its relationship with microsoft  the company has strategic relationships with ncd  tektronix  wyse and others 
the company is dependent on its strategic partners to successfully incorporate the company s technology into their products and to successfully market and sell such products 
competition 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive 
most of the competitors and potential competitors  including microsoft  have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
additionally  the announcement of the release  and the actual release of products competitive to the company s existing and future product lines such as microsoft s windows based terminal server and related plug ins  could cause existing and potential customers of the company to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of the company s existing and future product offerings  which would adversely impact is net revenues  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company s ability to market ica  picasso and other future product offerings will be dependent on microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme to allow client devices implementing ica  picasso or any such future product offerings to attach to the windows based terminal server 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to obtain and use information regarded as proprietary 
additionally  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future or that any such assertion will not result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such third parties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product concentration 
the company anticipates that one of its product technologies and future derivative products and product lines based upon this technology  if any  will constitute a majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to generate revenue from its picasso technology will be highly dependent upon market acceptance of windows based terminal server products  with which its product is intended to be combined to provide capabilities similar to those currently offered in the winframe technology line 
the company may experience declines in demand for products based on winframe technology  whether as a result of new competitive product releases  price competition  lack of success of its strategic partners  technological change or other factors 
in addition  the introduction of products based upon the picasso technology may be competitive with its winframe technology line and may delay or replace orders of either technology 
management of growth and anticipated operating expenses 
the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations  the number of its employees  and the geographic area of its operations 
in addition  the company has completed certain international acquisitions since october  assimilating the operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls  and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
although the company believes that it has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions  there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s current or future operations or that company management will be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market window for the company s products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its expanding product line  expand its sales and marketing organizations  and expand its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed products 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively or unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market window for the company s products and services in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the company expects that its requirements for office facilities and equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate 
the company plans to increase its professional staff during as sales  marketing and support and product development efforts as well as associated administrative systems are implemented to support planned growth 
as a result of this planned growth in staff  the company believes that additional facilities will be required during although the company believes that the cost of expanding in such additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or results of operations  the company anticipates that operating expenses will increase during as a result of its planned growth in staff and that such increase may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in information system conversion 
the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries all utilize separate applications to process their accounting transactions 
as a result  the company and its subsidiaries are currently in the process of converting a significant part of its business operations to a single accounting application purchased from a third party vendor 
although the company believes it has addressed all the significant issues related to this conversion  there can be no assurance that unanticipated software and hardware problems will not arise  which may result in delays in customer billings and vendor payments  as well as extended accounts receivable payment cycles 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success will depend  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
the effective management of the company s anticipated growth will depend  in a large part  upon the company s ability to retain its highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel as well as its ability to attract and maintain replacements for and additions to such personnel in the future 
new products and technological change 
the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements  including enhancements to certain key technology licensed from microsoft 
the company believes it will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the development  licensing  or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to existing products which will increase the company s cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
to the extent that such transactions have not yet occurred  the company cannot currently quantify such increase 
the company may use a substantial portion of its cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to fund these additional costs  in which case the company s interest income will decrease if not offset by cash flows from future operations 
additionally  the company and others may announce new products  new picasso capabilities or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
these market characteristics will require the company to continuously enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
the company may hire additional development staff to the extent they are needed in order to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
to the extent the company is unable to add additional staff and resources in its development efforts  future enhancement and additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  operating results and financial condition 
year compliance 
until recently  many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year utilizing both internal and external resources  the company is in the process of defining  assessing and converting  or replacing  various programs  hardware and instrumentation systems to make them year compatible 
the company s year project is comprised of two components business applications and equipment 
the business applications component consists of the company s business computer systems  as well as the computer systems of third party suppliers or customers whose year problems could potentially impact the company 
equipment exposures consist of personal computers  system servers  telephone equipment and elevators whose year problems could also impact the company 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operation or financial position 
the company s main product  winframe  is an authorized extension to microsoft windows nt v server 
while the company believes both windows nt v server and winframe enterprise versions  and are currently capable of storing four digit year data  allowing applications to differentiate between dates from the s and the year and beyond  such potential incompatibility with two digit application programs may limit the company s sales of product in those situations 
however  it is the application s responsibility to collect and properly store data 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be integrated by the company or its customers with  or otherwise interact with non compliant software or other products which may expose the company to claims from its customers or other third parties 
the foregoing could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products and services  increased service costs to the company or payment by the company of compensatory or other damages 
although most windows applications do store four digit year dates today  it is possible that some applications are now or have historically only collected two digit year data  winframe cannot create four digit year data for applications which have collected only two digits in year fields 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s software products that are designed to be year compliant contain all necessary technology to make them year compliant 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  thus potentially resulting in stalled market sales within the industry 
the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
potential for undetected errors 
despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments 
additionally  third party products  upon which the company s products are dependent  may contain defects which could reduce the performance of the company s products or render them useless 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors 
the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company s distributors and resellers are not within the control of the company  are not obligated to purchase products from the company  and may also represent other lines of products 
need to expand channels of distribution 
the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage these parties to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its direct sales force and add third party distributors both domestically and internationally 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins and related cash flows from operating activities 
new accounting pronouncements 
during october  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  different informal and unauthoritative interpretations of certain provisions of sop have arisen 
acsec is already deliberating amendments to sop  including deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of the sop so acsec can develop and issue an interpretation regarding the applicability and the method of application of those provisions 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of these amendments  the impact on the future financial results of the company is not currently determinable 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement established standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the new rule requires that the company a classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and b display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  and amends sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries 
this statement requires annual financial statements and interim reports to disclose information about products and services  geographic areas and major customers based on a management approach 
the management approach requires disclosing financial and descriptive information about an enterprise s reportable operating segments based on reporting information the way management organizes the segments for making business decisions and assessing performance 
it also eliminates the requirement to disclose additional information about subsidiaries that were not consolidated 
this new management approach may result in more information being disclosed than presently practiced and require new interim information not previously presented 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in with impact only to the company s disclosure information and not its results of operations 
revenue recognition process 
the company continually re evaluates its programs  including specific license terms and conditions  to market its various current and future products and services 
the company may implement new programs which may include  among other things  specified and unspecified enhancements to its current and future product lines 
revenues associated with such enhancements may be recognized after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or may be recognized over the product s life cycle 
the timing of the implementation of such programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements as well as factors such as determining vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each element offered separately and whether upgrades and enhancements are defined as upgrade rights pursuant to sop will impact the timing of the company s recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with its products  related enhancements and services 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the re evaluation of its programs  the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and whether upgrades and enhancements will be defined as upgrade rights pursuant to sop  and its impact on revenue recognition  the company cannot currently quantify the impact of such re evaluation on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
product returns and price reductions 
the company provides most of its distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product evaluation 
the company also provides most of its distributors and resellers with price protection rights 
the company has established reserves for each of these circumstances where appropriate  based on historical trends and evaluation of current circumstances 
although the company believes that it has adequate reserves to cover product returns  there can be no assurance that citrix will not experience significant returns in the future or that such reserves will be adequate 
international operations 
the company s continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company will need to establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
such international operations are subject to certain risks  such as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  dependence on independent relicensors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic conditions and changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions 
the demand for the company s products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
growth rate 
the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the levels attained in and  which were high  due primarily to the introduction of winframe in late however  to the extent the company s revenue growth continues  the commpany believes that its cost of goods sold and certain operating expenses will also increase 
due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  the company s income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease in
