overview the company is the entity resulting from the combination of ensys  ohmicron and sdi 
on august   ohmicron was merged with and into sdi  with certain ohmicron stockholders and note holders receiving shares of sdi common stock 
on december   sdi was merged with and into ensys 
the surviving entity was then renamed strategic diagnostics inc each of these transactions was accounted for as a purchase with sdi as the acquiring company and  therefore  the surviving company for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the historical financial information discussed includes the results of sdi for all periods presented and the actual results of ohmicron from august  and ensys from december  ensys was formed in to develop proprietary biotechnology based test systems designed for fast and inexpensive detection of various chemicals in soil and water samples 
ensys raised approximately million in equity financing  including approximately million from the sale of  shares of ensys common stock in its initial public offering in october since  ensys commercialized eleven immunoassay test kits and four other test kits for the detection of various environmental contaminants 
ensys marketed and sold these test kits and other associated products and services to environmental consulting and engineering firms  hazardous waste processing firms  environmental testing laboratories  and various state and federal agencies through distributors and a regionally based direct sales force in the us ensys also marketed and sold its products in europe through ensys europe limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ensys 
in march  ensys acquired from millipore  inc certain assets  which consisted primarily of inventory  work in process  equipment  intellectual property rights  contract rights and customer lists related to millipore s envirogard tm product line for million and  shares of ensys common stock 
ohmicron was founded in and began marketing its rapid assay registered trademark products in to the same general market and in the same fashion as previously described for ensys 
since its inception  sdi has focused on using proprietary technology and know how to develop  manufacture and market immunoassay test kits for applications primarily in the water quality  industrial testing and agricultural markets 
one of the strategies sdi used to develop its business was to establish relationships with other companies who had significantly greater resources and capabilities to evaluate market opportunities and potential for new products 
the company refers to these relationships as corporate partnerships 
corporate partners  who had identified and researched a market opportunity  funded sdi to develop and manufacture immunoassay products to meet the market need 
most of the corporate partner agreements were written so that sdi retained a right to manufacture the finished product  and the technology developed during the course of the project was co owned by sdi and its partner 
in this way  sdi developed proprietary technology and built a base of manufactured commercial products 
commercial operations were initiated with a contact with a corporate partner a large integrated chemical company to develop an immunoassay test to detect certain corrosion causing bacteria 
this product was introduced in late and sdi purchased all rights and technology related to this product in in february  sdi entered into a million corporate partnership with em industries  inc an affiliate of merck kgaa  darmstadt  germany for the development and manufacture of a line of immunoassay test kits capable of identifying and quantifying targeted priority pollutants 
the first products under this agreement were introduced in through august  these products were manufactured by sdi and marketed by em industries  inc in september  em industries  inc and sdi reached an agreement whereby the february agreement was terminated  together with em industries  inc s marketing rights thereunder  in exchange for certain specified royalty payments to em industries  inc and shares of sdi common stock 
the marketing activities with respect to such products in the us are now the responsibility of the company 
since  the company has entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the water quality  industrial testing  agricultural and other markets 
these agreements generally provide that sales and marketing costs associated with a new product are borne by the corporate partner 
in addition  the company currently sells directly other products that it has developed or acquired 
the company believes that its competitiveness has been enhanced through the combinations of talents  technology and resources resulting from the mergers and acquisitions described above 
the company has also achieved meaningful economies of scale  operates from consolidated facilities in newark  de and is now offering its customers the most appropriate test for each specific customer application 
another key strategy that sdi used to develop its business was the formation in of tsd bioservices  a joint venture between sdi and a subsidiary of taconic farms of germantown  ny 
taconic farms is a privately held company whose business is the production and sale of mice and rats  primarily to the research community 
in  the joint venture was dissolved and sdi s interests were distributed into a wholly owned subsidiary  tsd bioservices  inc tsd 
the mission of tsd is to supply antibodies  especially monoclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as the research community 
tsd s primary facility occupies approximately  square feet of space in newark  de 
the company believes that its products in the water quality  industrial testing and agricultural markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
the company experiences a seasonal pattern to its business 
sales of industrial and agricultural products are highest during the summer months with the lower levels of activity occurring during the winter months 
accordingly  revenues in a particular quarter in may not be indicative of revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year  or for the year 
as sales of the company s analytical tests for water soluble polymers which are generally not affected by seasonal patterns and agricultural products to other parts of the world develop over the next few years  the company expects its seasonal fluctuations to become gradually less pronounced 
results of operations as described above  the historical financial statements presented herein include the results of sdi for all periods and the results of ohmicron from august   tsd from october  and ensys from december  for comparative purposes  the following table sets forth the audited results of operations and the unaudited pro forma results of operations 
the unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results as if the acquisition of ohmicron  dissolution of tsd and the ensys merger had been completed at january  the pro forma financial information 
consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except share and per share data year ended december  actual pro forma unaudited net revenues product related   contract and other   total net revenues   operating expenses manufacturing   research and development   selling  general and administrative   total operating expenses   operating income loss   interest income expense  net net income   diluted net income per share applicable to common stockholders shares used in computing net income per share applicable to common stockholders   reflects the operations of the company as if the ensys  ohmicron and tsd transactions had occurred on january  expenses exclude costs of acquired research and development of million incurred in connection with the acquisitions of millipore s envirogard tm  ohmicron and ensys 
comparison of actual with pro forma financial information year ended december  versus pro forma year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in pro forma this increase is the result of a million increase in product related revenues reduced by a thousand decrease in contract and other revenues 
product related revenues increased to million in from pro forma million in this growth in product revenues is primarily attributable to increases in total product sales in emerging markets tests to detect i proprietary polymers and ii traits in genetically engineered plants in agriculture to million from thousand in pro forma  an increase of over  partially offset by a decrease in all other product revenue 
the increase in total product revenues in emerging markets was comprised of the first sales of a new product designed to detect the proprietary polymers of a corporate partner 
polymer detection is quite difficult and currently there is no other detection method capable of measuring these substances at the levels at which they are used or discharged in effluents 
the company is currently commercializing multiple tests in this area and began shipping its first product to a corporate partner during the third quarter of shipments of these pre commercial test kits continued during the fourth quarter and the company earned revenues of million during the second half of the company expects to ship additional tests in under this long term supply agreement  which provides among other things  for the company to exclusively manufacture these kits 
also contributing to the increase in product revenues were sales of tests to detect the presence of specified traits in genetically engineered plants 
the company shipped product under a supply agreement initiated during the second quarter of with a major seed company 
revenues under this agreement totaled approximately million during sales of similar tests to other customers in the agricultural market totaled million 
the company expects product sales in these emerging markets to grow significantly in and thereafter as these markets develop 
all other product revenues totaled million in compared to million in while sales of certain products in this category increased in over  overall  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales in the company s industrial testing category early in as duplicate customer relationships and early customer confusion over the integrated product lines resulting from the mergers 
these matters were addressed during through the company s sales and marketing channels 
the company expects product sales in this category to grow from the level but at a modest rate for the foreseeable future 
contract and other revenues decreased by less than to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to a slightly lower volume of research contracts in than in the company expects contract and other revenues to increase in as additional projects  particularly to develop additional products in the emerging markets in collaboration with its corporate partners  are anticipated 
while the experience of the company has been favorable  there can be no assurance that the anticipated projects and the growth rates described above will be realized 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased by million or in from million in pro forma to million 
this decrease is primarily the result of lower costs associated with more efficient operations after the integration of the separate companies 
the combined company has a lower level of personnel costs compared with each of the separate companies 
efficiencies were also achieved as duplicate facilities were closed 
the operations in north carolina and pennsylvania have now been consolidated into the company s delaware facilities 
manufacturing expenses  which include the costs of products sold  decreased thousand or in to million 
gross margins for product sales increased to in from in  due to increased sales volume and efficiencies gained through consolidation 
research and development expenses decreased million or to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to the consolidation of the research and development departments of sdi  ohmicron and ensys into one integrated operation focusing on a single set of corporate objectives 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in this decrease is attributable to the efficiencies afforded through the merger 
the company now maintains a single administrative function to support the operations of the company 
net interest and other income 
net interest income decreased thousand or to thousand in this decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average balance of investments during than in provision for income taxes 
due to net operating loss carry forwards  the company has made no provision for income taxes for although net operating loss carry forwards were obtained in connection with the mergers discussed above  the use of these carry forwards  if any  in any particular year will be limited in future years pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code 
the company estimates that it has approximately million of such carryforwards as of december  after the foregoing limitations see note to notes of consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income increased million to million in this increase was primarily the result of increased sales activity as well as lower operating costs  all as described above 
comparison of actual with historical financial information year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million in or over this increase is attributable to the increase in business activity after the mergers and the increased sales of products in the company s emerging markets all as described above 
product revenues increased million or for the reasons described above 
contract and other revenues decreased thousand or to million in the volume includes approximately thousand in revenues from transactions between ensys and sdi prior to the merger 
these businesses were integrated during operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million or in to million 
this decrease is attributable to the inclusion in of a one time charge of million to write off research and development costs acquired in connection with the mergers 
excluding this charge  operating expenses increased million or as a result of increases in manufacturing costs of million or  research and development expenses of thousand or and selling  general and administrative expenses of million or 
these increases are all attributable to the higher costs of operation principally additional personnel and related costs of the combined companies 
net interest income 
net interest income increased thousand in from thousand in this increase is attributable to the increase in invested funds acquired through the mergers 
net income 
net income increased million in to million from a loss of million 
this increase in net income is attributable to the higher volume of revenues reduced in part by the increased costs and the elimination of the one time write offs all associated with the mergers and all as described above 
year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in this million increase is the result of a million increase in product related revenues and a thousand increase in contract and other revenues 
product related revenues increased to million in from million in this was due to overall increased sales for certain of the company s new products  especially the first of the company s strip assays which was introduced in mid  improved priority pollutant sales over the prior year  and product related revenues generated by tsd bioservices in the fourth quarter of as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the product revenues do not include any revenues from any of the company s industrial testing kits in the fourth quarter of  since the company licensed these products to ensys in october however  revenues do include approximately thousand in product revenues from the sale of the company inventory  at cost  to ensys in connection with the license agreement 
contract and other revenues increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to a thousand license fee from ensys and ohmicron prior to the mergers  which was offset by a thousand decrease in contract revenue received from em industries in due to the completion of the em industries contract 
manufacturing expenses 
manufacturing expenses increased to million in from million in this million increase was primarily a result of the overall increase in product related sales during the year versus the prior year  and  to a lesser extent  the assumption of the expenses associated with the former ohmicron manufacturing facility in september research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of research and development personnel and certain salaries and related expenses  during the third quarter of acquired research and development expenses 
acquired research and development expenses were million in these expenses were incurred in connection with the merger transactions with ohmicron and ensys  and resulted in acquired research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the salaries and related expenses associated with the additional hiring of sales and marketing personnel required in connection with the company s acquisition of ohmicron and the company s direct selling of its products  as well as additional accounting and administrative support personnel necessitated by the mergers and the overall growth of the company 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income increased thousand to thousand in from thousand in due to increased cash balances from a january  preferred stock financing 
equity in income of tsd bioservices 
equity in income of the tsd bioservices partnership increased thousand to thousand in from thousand in this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in revenues for the partnership during versus the prior year 
in october  the tsd bioservices partnership was dissolved and its assets were liquidated  in connection with which certain of the rights and assets of the tsd bioservices partnership were distributed to tsd bioservices  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company utilizes computer software provided by third parties under a commercial license to support operations  including materials resource planning and general accounting 
the suppliers of such software have indicated their intentions to deliver updates to the application during so that it will continue to process information during and after the year the company expects that the costs of the changes necessary to process its information after the year will not have any material effect on its working capital or results of operations 
the company s working capital  which consists principally of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in to million at december  from million at december  this increase is attributable to the increases in cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable thousand and decreases in accounts payable of thousand  accrued expenses of million  other current liabilities of thousand and reduced by decreases in short term investments of million  inventories of thousand and other current assets of thousand the company believes it has  or has access to sufficient assets to meet its operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy and the success of the company s plans to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash available and on hand 
at december   the company has virtually no long term debt and stockholders equity of over million
