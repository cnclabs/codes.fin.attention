the costs associated with the start up of two new manufacturing facilities and the new retail sales centers had an adverse effect on the company s operating results in the second half of fiscal and in the first half of fiscal by october  both manufacturing facilities had become profitable 
effective august   a combination was consummated with the shareholders of oak creek exchanging their shares of oak creek common stock for shares of the company s common stock the combination 
in connection with the combination  all of the retail sales management personnel and manufacturing management personnel exchanged their shares of common stock in the company s subsidiaries for shares of the company s common stock

st century commenced operation in october the company accounts for its investment in st century using the equity method of accounting  showing its proportionate share of st century s earnings or losses as earnings or loss in affiliate 
in september  the company exercised its option to acquire guerdon after managing guerdon s operations under a management agreement since march guerdon produces manufactured homes in four facilities located in oregon  idaho  nebraska and mississippi  and sells its homes to over independent retailers located in states in the pacific northwest rocky mountain and south central regions of the united states 
in september  the company acquired heartland  a single plant manufacturer of low to medium priced homes in north carolina

vertical integration and internalization the company s growth strategy is based on an increasing degree of vertical integration over time 
vertical integration allows the company to increase its profit margins on the manufacture and sale of its products  and provides the ability to realize additional sources of income from financing the sales and insuring the company s products 
several elements of the company s growth strategy center on increasing the rate of internalization of its retail sales ie the proportion of new homes sold by company owned retail sales centers that are also manufactured by the company 
this strategy enables the company to earn both a manufacturing profit and a retailing profit on those home sales  however  only retail sales revenue is recognized 
accordingly  increasing the internalization rate without otherwise affecting the company s level of manufacturing and retailing activity has the effect of increasing gross margins and reducing reported revenues  however  aggregate gross profit in dollars is not materially affected by changes in the internalization rate 
another key element of the company s growth strategy is to increase the degree of retail penetration of its financial services 
as insurance product penetration increases  both reported revenues and earnings should increase without a corresponding increase in retail sales activity 
similarly  as st century finances more of the company s retail sales  the company s earnings should increase without a corresponding increase in retail sales activity 
results of operations the company s acquisition of brilliant in june was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all applicable periods have been restated to combine the previously separate entities

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
substantial increases in inventory and other working capital items required to open company owned retail sales centers account for most of the operating cash requirements in these periods 
in addition  cash was used in these periods to purchase inventory and fund working capital requirements for five new manufacturing facilities acquired in fiscal although the company acquired three new plants and opened or acquired thirty two new company owned retail sales centers in fiscal  additional inventory requirements were largely offset by a significant reduction in prevailing inventory levels at company owned retail sales centers 
an important part of the company s growth strategy is to continue to expand the number of company owned retail sales centers and increase its manufacturing capacity to supply a growing number of company owned retail sales centers and franchises 
management estimates the capital required to open a new retail sales center is approximately million to million  primarily for inventory and working capital 
subject to continued increases in demand  the company may incur additional capital expenditures to further increase its manufacturing capacity 
the company currently plans to open or acquire to retail sales centers each year for the next two years and  in connection therewith  to use cash to purchase inventory and operating assets and for working capital purposes

the remainder of the proceeds were used to temporarily reduce borrowings under the company s floor plan credit facility 
management believes that the company s current cash resources  available floor plan credit facility and cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy internal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next two fiscal years 
management also plans to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future 
financing for such acquisitions may be provided by cash from operations and from external sources 
in july  the company reached an agreement with several of its existing senior unsecured note holders to issue an additional million in new senior unsecured notes with an average rate of and which mature in the notes will require semi annual interest payments and equal annual principal reductions beginning in proceeds from the notes will be used to fund pending acquisitions with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
subject to certain conditions  closing is planned for early september inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has been modest and has primarily affected the company s manufacturing costs in the areas of labor  manufacturing overhead and raw materials other than lumber 
the price of lumber is affected more by the imbalances between supply and demand than by inflation 
historically  the company believes it has been able to minimize the effects of inflation by increasing the selling prices of its products  improving its manufacturing efficiency and increasing its employee productivity 
in addition  the company s business is seasonal  with weakest demand typically occurring during the company s third fiscal quarter december through february and the strongest demand typically occurring during the company s last fiscal quarter march through may 
over the history of the company s operations  management has not observed any correlation between interest rate fluctuations and increases or decreases in sales based solely on such fluctuations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
impact of year date sensitive computer applications that currently record years in two digit  rather than four digit  format may be unable to properly categorize and process dates occurring after december  the year problem 
the company is currently upgrading its software programs and operating systems at a cost of approximately million and believes that these new programs and systems will not be subject to the year problem 
the company intends to complete the upgrade by early if year related failures were to occur in the company s computer and information systems  however  the company could incur significant  unanticipated liabilities  expenses and possible disruption of its business 
additionally  risk of business disruption exists if year related failures occur among the company s lenders  suppliers  transporters and others upon which the company relies  but over which the company has no control
